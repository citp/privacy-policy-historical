**Privacy Policy**

Jaspersoft is committed to protecting your personal information and respecting your privacy. Our goal is to give you as much control and information as possible regarding your personal data and the use we make of it in the course of our business. We want to be a leader in providing comprehensive privacy information to our customers. In general, you can visit Jaspersoft Web sites without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself.

In order for us to provide you with quality support and service, it is necessary to provide limited personal information when using our support and information request forms. We assure that Jaspersoft will never sell, rent, or disclose your personal information to outside parties without your consent unless compelled by law or court order to do so. With your permission, Jaspersoft may send you e-mail regarding our new products, upgrades, or select third-party products. We do not disclose your personal information to third-parties.  
What Information We Gather and Track  
There are times when we may need to collect information from you through our Web site. This generally involves filling out forms so you can download or order a Jaspersoft or third party product from our Web site. When you download the Jaspersoft PDF files and other product information, we may require you to fill out a form with your name and e-mail address.

  Jaspersoft uses various methods to collect certain other kinds of information, including:

Cookies  
Referrers  
IP addresses   
System information

None of these methods can be personally identified with you with the exception of cookies, which can optionally store information that you may enter in forms on our Website, as described below. 

A "cookie" is an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system. It can be used to provide you with a tailored user experience. Some Jaspersoft pages use cookies. Cookies are used to better personalize the content, banners and promotions that you and other users will see. We may use the information to research and understand how our users' habits in the aggregate are similar or different so that we can enhance your experience on Jaspersoft sites and with our products. With your consent, cookies can optionally store information from forms that you fill out on our site so that next time you visit, you do not have to re-enter this information. For example, this would allow you to enter your zip code so that next time you visit, you can automatically see local content from your area. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. Jaspersoft does not require that you accept cookies.

Jaspersoft software may use Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) to notify us of the installation of one of Jaspersoft's products.

A "referrer" is the information passed along by a web browser that references the Web URL you linked from, and is automatically gathered by our Web server. This information is used by Jaspersoft to identify broad demographic trends that may be used to provide information tailored to your interests. You will not be personally identified from this information.

IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you. They are automatically gathered by our Web server. Jaspersoft will not use your IP address to attempt to identify your personal information.

System information we gather includes time, type of Web browser being used, the operating system/platform, and CPU speed. This information is sent automatically by your Web browser when you are connected to a Web site and is used by Jaspersoft only for broad demographic statistics. This information is used by Jaspersoft in identifying broad demographic trends and may be used to provide information appropriate for your computer system. You will not be personally identified from this information.  
What We Do With the Information We Gather and Track

The personal information gathered from the forms you fill out on our Web site is used in one of three ways:

1\. to provide you with information about products, services, news and events;  
2\. to allow you to download products;  
3\. to gather broad demographic information about user trends.

Jaspersoft, at times, must disclose relevant information about our customers to our contractors so they may provide specific services for Jaspersoft. Jaspersoft requires such contractors to keep your information strictly confidential and to use the information solely on behalf of Jaspersoft. For purposes of this Privacy Statement, such contractors are not considered "third-parties" and Jaspersoft may disclose personal information to such contractors without additional notice.

  
**What We Do with Information Gathered When You Acquire Third Party Products**  
Jaspersoft will never sell, rent or disclose to third parties our users' personal information collected from the distribution of Jaspersoft products or gathered on a Jaspersoft Web site. If you purchase a product or service developed or owned by a third-party, Jaspersoft may provide to the product owner or licenser the same information you provide to us.

  
**Rules for Forums, Bulletin Boards, and Other User - Supplied Material**  
Jaspersoft's website includes an area for registered users to post comments or upload and download materials. When using any of these areas, you agree not to post, send, transmit, upload, or otherwise publish through this site, any materials that (1) interfere with anyone else's use of the site; (2) are abusive, illegal, indecent, obscene, offensive, or threatening in any way; (3) encourage anyone to break the law; (4) violate anyone's copyright or other property right; (5) interfere with the privacy of any other user; (6) contain a virus or any other harmful component; or (7) contain false or misleading statements of fact or descriptions of the origin of the material or the communication. You further agree to comply with all additional terms which are referred to on this site.

  
**Feedback, Submissions, and Comments**  
Jaspersoft assumes no obligations of any kind with respect to any feedback provided to the company. Any questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, concepts, techniques, data, materials or information ("Feedback") that you provide to us shall not be regarded as confidential. We shall be free to reproduce, perform, use, disclose, exhibit, display, transform, create derivative works from, and/or distribute any Feedback without limitation. Further, we shall be free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, data or techniques contained in any Feedback for any purpose whatsoever, including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and marketing products that incorporate such ideas, concepts, know-how, data, or techniques.

  
**User's Material**  
Although Jaspersoft may from time to time monitor or review bulletin boards, forums, discussions, postings, transmissions, and the like on the site, Jaspersoft is under no obligation to do so and assumes no liability or responsibility arising from the contents of any such communications or for any defamation, error, inaccuracy, libel, obscenity, or profanity contained in any such communication. Site users are prohibited from posting or transmitting any defamatory, libelous, obscene, pornographic, profane, threatening, or unlawful material or any material that could constitute or encourage conduct that would be considered a criminal offense or give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any law. Jaspersoft may change, edit, or remove any user material or conversations that are illegal, indecent, obscene, or offensive, or that violate Jaspersoft policies in any way. Jaspersoft will cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing Jaspersoft to disclose the identity of anyone posting such materials.

  
**Communications to our Consumers**  
In addition to product update, promotional and informational e-mails that Jaspersoft sends to its users from time to time, we may, on occasion, invite you to participate in a focus group or send you postal mail. You may always opt-out of receiving such mail by notifying us. Once you supply us with personal information, such as an e-mail address, Jaspersoft does not change the manner of usage of such information from its original purpose, unless we first obtain your informed consent.  
Security of Personal Information

Jaspersoft employees are required to acknowledge that they understand and will strictly abide by our corporate policies with respect to the confidentiality of user personal information. Jaspersoft only gives access to databases containing personal information to employees on a need-to-know basis. Passwords are regularly changed pursuant to security protocols.

  
**Changes to our Privacy Policies**  
We revise our Web Site Privacy Policy to keep it up to date with Jaspersoft products, services and web pages. Jaspersoft will use reasonable efforts to comply with this privacy statement and will take prompt corrective action when it learns of any failure to comply with its privacy statement. Because of the complex and constantly changing nature of our technology and business, Jaspersoft does not guarantee error-free performance under this privacy statement. Jaspersoft shall not be liable for any incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to this privacy statement.
