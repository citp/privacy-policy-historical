# Privacy Policy :: Jaspersoft Business Intelligence Software

Jaspersoft is committed to protecting your personal information and respecting your privacy. Our goal is to give you as much control and information as possible regarding your personal data and the use we make of it in the course of our business. We want to be a leader in providing comprehensive privacy information to our customers. In general, you can visit Jaspersoft on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself.

**Jaspersoft Website Privacy Statement  
Effective March 13, 2007, last updated February 4, 2012 **

Jaspersoft has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe's program requirements including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. The TRUSTe program does not cover information that may be collected through downloadable software. TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions. If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at [info@jaspersoft.com](mailto:info@jaspersoft.com). If you are not satisfied with our response you can contact [TRUSTe here](http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint).

The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site.

## What Information We Gather and Track

There are times when we may need to collect information from you through our Website. This generally involves filling out forms so you can download or order a Jaspersoft or third party product from our Website. If you register on our site, sign up for a Webinar, subscribe to our newsletter or promotional emails or download a PDF file or other product information, we will request your name, job title, company name, address, email address, and phone number, information about your company and your interest in our products.

Jaspersoft uses various methods to collect certain other kinds of information, including:

  * Cookies
  * Referrers
  * IP addresses
  * System information



None of these methods can be personally identified with you, with the exception of cookies, which can optionally store information that you may enter in forms on our Website, as described below.

Jaspersoft's software may use Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) to notify us of the installation of one of Jaspersoft's products.

A "cookie" is an element of data that a Website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system. It can be used to provide you with a tailored user experience. Some Jaspersoft pages use cookies. Cookies are used to better personalize the content, banners and promotions that you and other users will see. We may use the information to research and understand how our users' habits in the aggregate are similar or different so that we can enhance your experience on Jaspersoft Websites and with our products. With your consent, cookies can optionally store information from forms that you fill out on our site so the next time you visit, you do not have to re-enter this information. For example, this would allow you to enter your zip code so the next time you visit, you can automatically see local content from your area. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. Jaspersoft does not require that you accept cookies. Some of our business partners (e.g., third-party tracking services) use cookies on our site. We have no access to, or control over, these cookies.

A "referrer" is the information passed along by a web browser that references the Web URL you linked from, and is automatically gathered by our Web server. This information is used by Jaspersoft to identify broad demographic trends that may be used to provide information tailored to your interests. You will not be personally identified from this information.

Your computer uses IP addresses every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you. Our Web server automatically gathers them. Jaspersoft will not use your IP address to attempt to identify your personal information.

System information we gather includes time, type of Web browser being used, the operating system/platform, and CPU speed. Your Web browser sends this information automatically when you are connected to a Website and is used by Jaspersoft only for broad demographic statistics. This information is used by Jaspersoft in identifying broad demographic trends and may be used to provide information appropriate for your computer system. You will not be personally identified from this information.

We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate (e.g., page views and traffic patterns) to improve the quality of information on this site.

## Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

We employ [or our third party advertising partner employs] a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.”

## What We Do With the Information We Gather and Track

The personal information gathered from the forms you fill out on our Website is used in one of three ways:

  1. to provide you with information about products, services, news and events;
  2. to allow you to download products
  3. to gather broad demographic information about user trends.



Jaspersoft, at times, must disclose relevant information about our customers to our contractors, such as marketing services and Web analytics companies, so they may provide specific services to Jaspersoft. Jaspersoft requires such contractors to keep your information strictly confidential and to use the information solely on behalf of Jaspersoft and not for their own marketing purposes. For purposes of this Privacy Statement, such contractors are not considered "third parties" and Jaspersoft may disclose personal information to such contractors without additional notice.

Jaspersoft maintains a Company Directory that lists customers and customer quotes. Prior consent was obtained prior to the use of personally identifiable information, quotations, and company logos. If for any reason a Company chooses to not have information listed in the Company Directory, contact Jaspersoft at [webmaster@jaspersoft.com](mailto:webmaster@jaspersoft.com) with a request to be removed.

Jaspersoft maintains a Partner Directory with information about Jaspersoft business partners. If for any reason a Partner would like to be removed from the directory they may do so by contacting [webmaster@jaspersoft.com](mailto:webmaster@jaspersoft.com) with a request to be removed.

## Legal Disclaimer

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website

## What We Do with Information Gathered When You Acquire Third Party Products

Jaspersoft will never sell, rent or disclose to third parties our users' personal information collected from the distribution of Jaspersoft products or gathered on a Jaspersoft Website except as described in this privacy policy. If you purchase a product or service developed or owned by a third party, Jaspersoft may provide to the product owner or licensor the same information you provided to us for the purposes of maintaining their client records.

## Links to Other Sites

This Website contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Jaspersoft. Please be aware that Jaspersoft is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Website that collects personally identifiable information.

This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Website.

## About JasperForge.org Forums

If you choose to use the JasperForge.org forum (bulletin board) or blog on jasperforge.org, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.

### How we Process Your Order

Jaspersoft relies on a third-party order processing service, Ultracart, to complete your order. Ultracart is an industry leader in providing E-Commerce Payment Processing Services and will collect your credit card information, name, and other personally identifiable information for the purposes of processing your transaction. They are prohibited from using this information for any other purpose, including their own marketing purposes.

## Feedback, Submissions, and Comments

Jaspersoft assumes no obligations of any kind with respect to any feedback provided to the company. Any questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, concepts, techniques, data, materials or information ("Feedback") that you provide to us shall not be regarded as confidential.

Further, we shall be free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, data or techniques contained in any Feedback for any purpose whatsoever, including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and marketing products that incorporate such ideas, concepts, know-how, data or techniques.

## User's Material

Although Jaspersoft may from time to time monitor or review bulletin boards, forums, discussions, postings, transmissions, and the like on our Websites, Jaspersoft is under no obligation to do so and assumes no liability or responsibility arising from the contents of any such communications or for any defamation, error, inaccuracy, libel, obscenity, or profanity contained in any such communication. Site users are prohibited from posting or transmitting any defamatory, libelous, obscene, pornographic, profane, threatening, or unlawful material or any material that could constitute or encourage conduct that would be considered a criminal offense or give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any law. Jaspersoft may change, edit, or remove any user material or conversations that are illegal, indecent, obscene, or offensive, or that violate Jaspersoft policies in any way. Jaspersoft will cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing Jaspersoft to disclose the identity of anyone posting such materials.

## Communications to our Consumers

In addition to product update, promotional and informational e-mails that Jaspersoft sends to its users from time to time that they have opted to receive on our registration page, we may, on occasion, invite you to participate in a focus group or send you postal mail. If you register with Jaspersoft on this site, we will send you a confirmation e-mail. We will also send you e-mail if you download products or white papers from this site, register to attend a Jaspersoft Webinar, seminar, or other event, or request to become a Jaspersoft Partner. If you would prefer to not receive any of these communications see "Choice/Opt-out."

## Choice/Opt-out

Once you supply us with personal information, such as an e-mail address, Jaspersoft does not change the manner of usage of such information from its original purpose, unless we first obtain your informed consent. You may change your email preferences by contacting [info@jaspersoft.com](mailto:info@jaspersoft.com).

## Service-related Announcements

We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. You may not opt-out of receiving these service related announcements that are not promotional in nature.

## Access to Personally Identifiable Information

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in any email from Jaspersoft, by emailing Customer Support at [info@jaspersoft.com](mailto:info@jaspersoft.com) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.

## Security

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can send email to us at [webmaster@jaspersoft.com](mailto:webmaster@jaspersoft.com).

Jaspersoft employees are required to acknowledge that they understand and will strictly abide by our corporate policies with respect to the confidentiality of user personal information. Jaspersoft only gives access to databases containing personal information to employees on a need-to-know basis. Passwords are regularly changed pursuant to security protocols.

Data Retention: We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at [email address]. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
