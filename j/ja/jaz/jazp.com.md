# Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**

 **Is shopping on Jazp.com secure?**

Absolutely. Our site uses the latest SSL encryption technology, which ensures that all data, including your personal information, remains private and secure.

We also use CyberSource, a secure global payment management platform, so you can use your credit card to shop at Jazp.com, completely stress-free.

Our Privacy Policy also explains everything else we do to keep your personal information secure, once received. Once you place an order the seller confirms receipt of the order and begins processing it.

Jazp.com gives a complete guarantee for the protection of privacy of site visitors and customers. Since we understand the importance of the privacy of each person, we place high value on a customer’s privacy. We never share customer information with any third parties except to deliver a service to you, for instance arranging product delivery, carrying out credit and other security checks and for the purposes of customer research and profiling, or where we have your express permission to do so. We will not sell your name, address, e-mail address, credit card information or personal information to any third party without your permission. However we cannot be responsible or held liable for the actions of third party sites from which you may have linked or been directed to the Jazp.com website.

**Site Statistics**

We may disclose aggregate, anonymised statistics about the number of visitors to this Website or number of purchases made as required by our investors. We use an independent measurement and research company to gather data regarding the visitors to this Website on our behalf using cookies and a code which is embedded in the site. Both the cookies and the embedded code provide statistical information about visits to pages on the site, the duration of individual page view, paths taken by visitors through the site, data on visitors' screen settings and other general information. Jazp.com uses and stores this type of information, as with that obtained from other cookies used on the site, to help it improve the services to its users. Further information regarding the way in which this information is obtained and used can be obtained by contacting us through the [Contact US](http://www.jazp.com/contactus) section of the site _._

**Protecting your security**

We may use personal information provided by you in order to conduct appropriate anti-fraud checks. Personal information that you provide may be disclosed to a credit reference or fraud prevention agency, which may keep a record of that information. This is done only to confirm your identity - a credit check is not performed and your credit rating is unaffected.

**Transfers of your Information** The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the UAE. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the UAE who work for Jazp.com or one of our suppliers or agencies. Such processing may, for example, be required in order to fulfill your order, process your payment details or provide support services. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. We will do our best to protect your personal data, but cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.

**Disclosure of personal information**  We may disclose your personal information to third parties:

                            If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Jazp.com, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

**Third party sites   **

Our site may contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and other third parties. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that they have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.

**Checking your Details**

If you wish to verify the details you have submitted to Jazp.com you may do so by contacting us via the Contact Us section. Our security procedures mean that we may request proof of identity before we reveal information. This proof of identity will take the form of your e-mail address and password submitted upon registration. You must therefore keep this information safe as you will be responsible for any action which we take in response to a request from someone using your e-mail and password. We would strongly recommend that you do not use the browser's password memory function as that would permit other people using your terminal to access your personal information.
