We may share your information as described in this Privacy Policy (e.g., with our Third-Party service providers or business partners; to comply with legal obligations; to protect and defend our rights and property) or with your permission.

  * **We Use Vendors and Service Providers.** We may share any information we receive with vendors and service providers. The types of service providers (processors) to whom we entrust Personal Information include service providers for: (i) provision of IT and related services; (ii) provision of information and services you have requested; (iii) payment processing; and (iv) customer service activities; and (v) in connection with the provision of the Services. Jazwares has executed appropriate contracts with the service providers that prohibit them from using or sharing Personal Information except as necessary to perform the contracted services on our behalf or to comply with applicable legal requirements.
  * **Business Partners.** Jazwares may share Personal Information with our business partners, and affiliates for our and our affiliates’ internal business purposes or to provide you with a product or service that you have requested. Jazwares may also provide Personal Information to business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you. In such cases, our business partner’s name will appear, along with Jazwares’. Jazwares requires our affiliates and business partners to agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality and security of Personal Information they maintain on our behalf and not to use it for any purpose other than the purpose for which Jazwares provided them.
  * **Displaying to Other Users.** The content you post to the Site may be displayed on the Site. Other users of the Site may be able to see some information about you, such as your name, profile information, or if you vote, submit commentary or post a review. We are not responsible for privacy practices of the other users who will view and use the posted information.
  * **Marketing.** Interest-Based Advertising and Third-Party Marketing. Through our Services, Jazwares may allow Third-Party advertising partners to set tracking tools (e.g., cookies) to collect information regarding your activities (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day). We may also share such de-identified information as well as selected Personal Information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) we have collected with Third-Party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit non-Jazwares related websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioural advertising”. We may allow access to other data collected by the Site to facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you. If you prefer that we do not share your Personal Information with Third-Party advertising partners, you may opt-out of such sharing at no cost by following the instructions in Section 4.0 below.
  * **Disclosures to Protect Us or Others (e.g., As Required by Law and Similar Disclosures).** We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information, other account information, and content if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: (i) comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (ii) respond to your requests; (iii) protect yours’, ours’ or others’ rights, property, or safety; (iv) to enforce Jazwares policies or contracts; (v) to collect amounts owed to Jazwares; (vi) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity; or (vii) if we, in good faith, believe that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable.

In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security purposes – e.g., to detect unauthorized activity on the Services. In such cases, server log data containing IP addresses may be shared with law enforcement bodies in order that they may identify users in connection with their investigation of the unauthorized activities.

  * **Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers.** If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, then your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract. Should such an event occur, Jazwares will endeavour to direct the transferee to use Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such Personal Information was collected.



#### 3.2. Data Transfers

All Personal Information sent or collected via or by Jazwares may be stored anywhere in the world, including but not limited to, in the United States, in the cloud, our servers, the servers of our affiliates or the servers of our service providers.

You have the right to opt out of and object to certain uses and disclosures of your Personal Information, as set out in this Privacy Policy.

Where you have consented to Jazwares’ Processing of your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information, you may withdraw that consent at any time and opt-out to further Processing by following the instructions in this Section.

#### 4.2. Email and Telephone Communications

If you receive an unwanted email from us, you can use the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of the email to opt-out of receiving future emails. We will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt. Note that you will continue to receive transaction-related emails regarding products or services you have requested. We may also send you certain communications regarding Jazwares and our Services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications (e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy).

We maintain telephone “do-not-call” and “do-not-mail” lists as mandated by law. We process requests to be placed on do-not-mail, do-not-phone and do-not-contact lists within 60 days after receipt, or such shorter time as may be required by law.

#### 4.3. Human Resources Data

With regard to Personal Information that Jazwares receives in connection with the employment relationship, Jazwares will use such Personal Information only for employment-related purposes as more fully described above. If Jazwares intends to use this Personal Information for any other purpose, Jazwares will notify the Individual and provide an opportunity to opt-out of such uses.

#### 4.4 “Do Not Track”

Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.

#### 4.5. Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising

As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their device settings.

The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at [www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](https://web.archive.org/web/20181229021318id_/http%3A//www.jazwares.com/www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp), or <http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/> and [www.aboutads.info/choices/](https://web.archive.org/web/20181229021318id_/http%3A//www.jazwares.com/www.aboutads.info/choices/). You can also choose not to be included in Google Analytics [here](hhttp://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out or an online industry opt-out, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt-out on each device. Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.

## 5\. Rights of Access, Rectification, Erasure, and Restriction

You may inquire as to whether Jazwares is Processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate. Where otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may send an e-mail to [privacy@jazwares.com](mailto:privacy@jazwares.com) or use any of the methods set out in this Privacy Policy to request access to, receive (port), restrict Processing, seek rectification, or request erasure of Personal Information held about you by Jazwares. Such requests will be processed in line with local laws.

Although Jazwares makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Jazwares is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If Jazwares determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Jazwares will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.

## 6\. Security

We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. We do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.

By using the Services or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Services. If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice on the Site or sending an e-mail to you. You may have a legal right to receive this notice in writing.

## 7\. Retention

Jazwares retains the Personal Information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Services or as necessary to fulfil the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our products and Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements and comply with applicable laws.

If we learn that a child under age 16 has provided us with personal information, we will close the member’s account and delete the child’s personal information (except as may be necessary for legal compliance).  Creators must be 18 or older: If your child is under the age of 18 and has an idea that they would like to submit, please contact [privacy@jazwings.com](mailto:privacy@jazwings.com) and we will work with you to create your own account in order to submit the idea on your child’s behalf.

We will not condition a Child’s participation in an activity, like contests, on the Child’s disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. Once collected, a Child’s registration information may be used to: (a) allow participation in activities on our Site (e.g., contests) and (b) allow us to communicate with the Child regarding promotional materials, including information about new products, contests, features and enhancements, special offers, and other events of interest. We may also use the information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so that we can constantly improve the products and Services we provide to our visitors and better meet their needs.

  * Jazwares might collect information from Children under age 13 without verifiable parental consent in the following special situations as outlined in COPPA:
  * Jazwares may collect an email address to respond to a one-time request from a Child. After responding to the request, Jazwares will delete the email address.
  * Jazwares may collect email addresses of parents or Children in order to provide notice and seek consent for the Child’s submission of information.
  * Jazwares may collect an email address for an ongoing request by a Child, for example a subscription to a newsletter, but Jazwares will provide notice to parents about the ongoing communication and will provide parents with the opportunity to stop the communication before delivering the second communication.
  * Jazwares may collect information necessary to protect the safety of the Child who is participating on the site. Jazwares will notify parents of this collection and allow them the opportunity to prevent further use of the information.
