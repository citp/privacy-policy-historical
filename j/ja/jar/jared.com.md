Signet Jewelers Privacy Policy  
 _Last revised December 30th, 2019_

At Signet Jewelers ("Signet"), we respect our customers' privacy. Signet operates worldwide under name brands including Kay Jewelers, Jared The Galleria Of Jewelry, Zales, Zales Outlet, and Piercing Pagoda. This privacy policy ("Policy") applies to all Signet activities, including, but not limited to our retail locations, brands' websites, and all other websites, mobile sites, services, applications, platforms and tools where this Policy appears or is linked (collectively, our "Website"). This Policy is to inform you about how we collect, use, share, and protect personal information. By providing information to us (by any means, whether in a store, in correspondence, via our Website or otherwise) you consent to our use of the information you provide in accordance with this Policy. Any reference to our Website includes its e-mail, text, live chat, and other electronic messages. If you do not agree with this Policy or our practices, you may not use our Website. This Policy may change from time to time and is incorporated into our Website Terms of Use. Your continued use of our Website constitutes your acceptance of those changes. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically.

 **Information We Collect**

There are several ways we may obtain information about you, including through (A) information you provide to us directly; (B) information that we automatically collect; and (C) information we receive from third parties. This includes data that identifies you personally whether directly (i.e., your name) or indirectly (i.e., information about your online use).

 **A. Information You Provide**

We collect personal information about you in various ways, online, offline, and by telephone. The types of personal information we may collect include: 

  * **Information You Provide When You Interact with the Website.**
    * We collect your name, postal address, email address, mobile or other telephone number, username and password if you register an account with us.
    * We collect content information you provide, including photos and comments.
    * We collect customer service inquiries, and related history that you share with us.
    * We collect information you provide regarding your personal or professional interests, date of birth, anniversary date, demographics (such as gender, occupation, income and marital status), experiences with our products, and shopping and contact preferences.
    * We also may collect information about the location of the devices used to access the Website ("Location Data"). Location Data includes: (a) the location of the mobile device or tablet derived from GPS or WiFi use; (b) the IP address of the mobile device or tablet or internet service used to access the Website; and (c) other information made available by a user or others that indicates the current or prior location of the user, such as geotag information in photographs. If you do not want us to collect Location Data from your device, please delete the app or disable the location settings on your device or tablet. Note, however, that disabling the location setting may affect your ability to access and use that app.


  * **Information You Provide When You Make a Purchase.** If you make a purchase from us, we collect a credit/debit card number and related financial information (such as CVV, expiration date, and billing address), or other payment information (such as via PayPal or Apple Pay), depending on the form of payment you choose. We also collect purchase, return, wish list and transaction information.


  * **Information You Provide When You Apply for Credit:** You may also be required to provide certain information when you apply for credit. We and the credit provider may be required to collect some information, including: your name, address, email address, phone number, date of birth, and other information needed to assess your credit worthiness and verify your identity, such as social security number and employment-related information. We require this information to process your application. If you choose to link to a credit provider’s or other third party site, they may have privacy policies that differ from our own, and we are not responsible for the practices of such sites. You therefore should refer to their privacy policies to understand how they collect and handle your information and what kinds of choices you have.


  * **Information You Provide about a Third Party.** If you send someone else a communication from the Website, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (e.g., name, e-mail address) will be used to facilitate the communication.


  * **Information You Provide Through Social Media.** You may also be given the option to link to your social media account through the Website. When you do, we may automatically receive certain information about you based on your registration and privacy settings on those third party services.
