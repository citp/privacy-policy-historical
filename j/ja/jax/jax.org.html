			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            
            <p>The Jackson Laboratory is strongly committed to protecting your privacy and providing a safe online experience for all our users.</p>
<h4>Information collection</h4>
<p>We collect two types of information during Web visits:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1) information that you submit to us and</p>
<p>&nbsp;2) information automatically recorded by our computer server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<i>We will never intentionally collect any information from children or minors. No part of The Jackson Laboratory website is targeted to children or minors.</i> </p>
<p>Please be assured that we will not sell or rent information collected during visits to the Web site to any third party. However, we may need to provide such information to a third party if required by third party license agreements, by grant obligations, or by law. </p>
<h4>Information you submit</h4>
<p>If you choose to provide us with additional information about yourself through an email message, form, survey, etc., we will not provide this information to any third parties. Forms submitted may include some "required information" which is necessary to process the request and to communicate with you. These forms also include "optional" information, which you can provide at your discretion and is used to help us better serve you and your organization. The information you submit is maintained on a confidential basis and used to provide a high level of personalization, value, and customer support to the users of The Jackson Laboratory Web site.</p>
<h3>Information collected automatically</h3>
<h4>Aggregate information</h4>
<p>Our computer server(s) operating the Web site automatically collect statistical information on site traffic and usage patterns (e.g., how many people visit the site, frequently visited pages, browsers used, etc.). Data about visits is analyzed in aggregate with many other visits to give us information about the effectiveness of the Web site. An example of use of this aggregate information would be analyzing this information to identify specific Web pages to improve that would enhance the overall functionality of the Web site.</p>
<h4>Standard information collected about individual website visits</h4>
<p>The standard information that is automatically collected and stored about your visit to our Web site includes: </p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The domain name from which you access the Internet. For example, if you connect to the Internet through America Online, the domain name is aol.com. 
</li><li>The name and version of your computer's operating system and browser. For example, Windows XP, Internet Explorer, or Firefox. 
</li><li>The Internet protocol address of the computer you use to access the Internet. An Internet protocol address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you log on to your Internet service provider. 
</li><li>The Internet address of the Web site from which you come to our site if you do not directly type in www.jax.org. 
</li><li>The date, time, and duration of your visit to our site, and the pages you visit. </li></ul>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>Our web site may use <i>cookies</i>; a unique, alphanumeric identifier sent to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser, to remember information your computer has sent to us (e.g., mailing addresses, course preferences, etc.) upon revisits to our Web site. An example of cookie usage on the Web site might be to pre-populate certain information fields on some forms for your convenience.</p>
<p>If you do not want your browser to accept cookies, you can turn off the cookie acceptance option in your browser settings. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. </p>
<p>The Jackson Laboratory&nbsp;is currently using and has contracted with Omniture, a third party, to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers to administer our Web site and constantly improve its quality. All data collected by Omniture on behalf of&nbsp;The Jackson Laboratory&nbsp;is owned and used by The Jackson Laboratory&nbsp;. The Jackson Laboratory&nbsp; reserves the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding its Web site visitors for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers. Please note that this is not personal information, only general summaries of the activities of our visitors and customers.&nbsp;<a class="" href="http://www.omniture.com/privacy" target="_self" title="Omniture Privacy Policy">Read Omniture's privacy policy</a>, including how to opt out.</p>
