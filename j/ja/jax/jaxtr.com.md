# jaxtr - privacy policy

Effective December 14, 2006:

**About jaxtr**  
Jaxtr is a web-initiated communications service. Jaxtr members control, and can change at any time, their personal information that is available to others.

Jaxtr cares deeply about online privacy. If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please contact us in writing by visiting our [Contact page](https://web.archive.org/web/20071228042857id_/http%3A//www.jaxtr.com/user/aboutcont.jsp). 

**Information Collection and Use by jaxtr**  
Jaxtr collects user submitted information such as name, email address, phone number, and age to authenticate users and to send notifications to those users relating to the jaxtr service. 

Jaxtr also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, time zone, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to the site. Such data are used to manage the website, track usage and improve the website services. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to members. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes 

User information, including members' pictures and user names, are displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction. Email addresses are used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join jaxtr and to send notifications related to the service. With the exception of notifications and invitations, a user's email address is not shared or displayed to others. Our members' private phone numbers are not displayed to users that call them. Users' full names are never directly revealed to other members. To facilitate searching and finding interesting content on the service, jaxtr may allow users to search for other members using first and last name, email address, and other standard search strategies.

We may also use a user's email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding the service. 

From time to time, jaxtr or a partner may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on jaxtr. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply. 

**Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members**  
Jaxtr members can invite other people to join the service by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. Jaxtr stores the email addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added to the contact's list of the member sending the invitations, and also to send reminders of the invitations. Jaxtr does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations, invitation reminders (up to three (3) per email address). Recipients of invitations from jaxtr may contact jaxtr to request the removal of their information from our database. 

Jaxtr members may also store email addresses of people they know in their internal jaxtr address book and may also choose to send invitations and other communications to those addresses.

You may prevent jaxtr email invitations and other messages from being sent to any email address you control by contacting us in writing through our [Contact page](https://web.archive.org/web/20071228042857id_/http%3A//www.jaxtr.com/user/aboutcont.jsp) or by replying to any email message we send you with the words "unsubscribe" in the Subject line. 

**Phone Communications**  
You may use jaxtr to initiate or receive phone calls which are partly or fully handled via jaxtr telecommunications partners. Therefore any information which you may communicate during such phone calls, including any personal information shall not be deemed private. Jaxtr cannot guarantee the security of such information, that you disclose or communicate in such phone calls and you do so at your own risk. 

**Use of Cookies**  
Jaxtr uses cookies to store visitors' preferences and to record session information, for purposes including ensuring compliance with our terms and policies, to improve the user experience with our services, and to customize Web page and widget content based on browser type and user profile information. You may be able to configure your browser to accept or reject all or some cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set -- each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. Please note that jaxtr may allow third party advertisers that are presenting advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer. Advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the jaxtr Privacy Policy. 

**Links**  
Jaxtr may contain links to other sites. Jaxtr is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When linking to another site a user should read the privacy policy stated on that site. Our Privacy Policy only governs information collected on jaxtr. 

**Public Postings**  
Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post or communicate public information on jaxtr that information can be accessed by the public and can in turn be used by those people to send you unsolicited communications.

**Correcting/Updating or Removing Information**  
Jaxtr users may modify or remove any of their personal information at any time by logging into their account and accessing features such as Account/Settings page. 

**Third Party Advertising**  
Advertisements appearing on our site may be delivered to users by jaxtr or one of our Web advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by jaxtr and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. 

**Security**  
Jaxtr member accounts are secured by member-created passwords. Jaxtr takes precautions to insure that member account information is kept private. We use reasonable measures to protect member information that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to member information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff. Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of member account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time. For any additional information about the security measures we use on jaxtr, please contact us in writing by visiting our [Contact page](https://web.archive.org/web/20071228042857id_/http%3A//www.jaxtr.com/user/aboutcont.jsp). 

**Sharing and Disclosure of Information jaxtr Collects**  
Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, we will not disclose personal information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process received by jaxtr, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the jaxtr Terms of Use Agreement or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety of members of the public and users of the service. Jaxtr reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of jaxtr or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest. For more information see the "Changes in Our Privacy Policy" section below. 

**Changes in Our Privacy Policy**  
From time to time we may make changes to our privacy policy. If we make changes, we will post them on our site(s) to make users aware of what the changes are so users will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and when we may disclose it. A User is bound by any minor changes to the policy when she or he uses the site after those changes have been posted. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify by posting a notice on our site for thirty days.
