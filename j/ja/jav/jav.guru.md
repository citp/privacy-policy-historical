Export outside the EEA

Certain countries outside the EEA have been approved by the European Commission as providing essentially equivalent protections to EEA data protection laws and therefore no additional safeguards are required to export personal information to these jurisdictions. If we decide that, staff in those countries which have not had these approvals, will have access to your personal information, we will either ask for your consent to the transfer or transfer it’s subject to European Commission approved contractual terms that impose equivalent data protection obligations directly on the recipient unless we are permitted under applicable data protection law to make such transfers without such formalities.

 **Storage limits**

So if the information is used for two purposes we will retain it until the purpose with the latest period expires, but we will stop using it for the purpose with a shorter period one that period expires.  
We restrict access to your personal information to those persons who need to use it for the relevant purpose(s). Our retention periods are based on business needs and your information that is no longer needed is either irreversibly anonymized (and the anonymized information may be retained) or securely destroyed.
