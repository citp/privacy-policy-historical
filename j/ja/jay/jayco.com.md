##  Your Personal Information

When you visit Jayco.com, information about your visit may be collected and stored for analytical purposes.

We will not sell, share or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our web site, to notify consumers about updates to our Web site or our Products, and to contact consumers for marketing purposes. We may share information with our dealers to help them sell and service Jayco products, with our Ownersâ€™ Clubs, and with other outside interests who act as our agents in market research, advertising projects and sales programs.
