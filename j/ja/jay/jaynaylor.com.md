## Our Commitment To Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. 

## The information we collect:

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on JayNaylor.com. On some pages, you can order products or subscriptions, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:

  * Name
  * Address
  * Email Address
  * Phone Number



## The Way We Use Information:

**We do not sell or trade your information with any other company.** We only use your information to process/validate credit cards and, if applicable, to ship orders. We do not SPAM or give your information out to anyone, ever.

## Our Commitment to Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

## How You Can Access or Correct Your Information

When an order is placed, you have the opportunity to update your personal information. Your information will be displayed on the order screen, and you can change it accordingly. Changes will be saved in our database. Because we do not require your information for anything beyond processing credit card information, it is not important that it be kept up to date except when your order is actually being processed.
