All information you provide to us or that we collect from you is stored on our secure servers within the European Economic Area (“ **EEA** ”) or on the servers of our respective hosting service providers, which we may change from time to time.

However, the personal data that we collect from you regarding your membership payment and your subscription to marketing emails will be transferred to, processed and stored at destinations outside the EEA, such as the United States.

There is no adequacy decision by the European Commission in respect of the United States, which means the United States is not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection to your personal data.

Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology.

The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will use our best endeavours to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Site and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use suitable procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of the Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
