**Consent**

Your use of our Service signifies your consent to us collecting and using personal information about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Should we choose to change our Privacy Policy for any reason, the changes will be posted here, so that you are always kept informed of how we collect and use your personal information, and when we may disclose it. 

**Registration Information**

Although certain areas of our website are made available to all visitors, before you can use the Service, you will need to register your details with us in accordance with the registration details. If you have not already done so, please register your details. Should you not register your details, you will not be allowed to use the Service. We reserve the right to ask for your date of birth to verify your age. Please note we will not collect the personal information of any individual who tells us he or she is under the age of 18. 

**How we collect information from you**

In order to process your account for the Service and in order to reconcile our accounts, WorldPay or such other payment partner as we may use from time to time may provide us with information detailing the credits and/or debits made to your credit/debit card. 

**How we look after your information**

We make sure that all the information we hold on you is as safe as possible. In addition, we have strict security procedures covering the storage and disclosure of your information in order to prevent unauthorised access and to comply with the UK Data Protection Act 1998. This means that sometimes we may ask you for proof of identity before disclosing any personal information to you. 

**What do we do with your information?**

We use your information to process orders you make from our Site. We may contact you from time to time to let you know about our services which may include sending you newsletters and news on events that you may be interested in. You can elect not to receive such marketing material at any time by writing to info@jancisrobinson.com 

**When do we give information that you provide us with to other people?**

Apart from entities that are involved in helping us to run our Site, we never give your information to any third parties. The entities that help us run our site are DediPower, which hosts our site, and WorldPay, which provides credit card payment processing services. 

  
We and WorldPay share information with each other only to the extent necessary for the purposes of processing payments and to enable us to retrieve payments from WorldPay. See the [WorldPay terms and conditions](http://www.worldpay.com/about_us/index.php?page=tandc&c=UK) for further information.   


  
We reserve the right to access and disclose individually identifiable information (i) to comply with applicable laws and government requests, (ii) to be able to operate our systems properly or (iii) to protect ourselves or our users.
