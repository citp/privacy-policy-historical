<p>
    Janssen Global Services, LLC<strong> </strong>is concerned about privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with
    how we collect, use, and disclose
    information. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we or our service
    providers collect through the Web site or
    Web property (including, for example, a mobile Web site or application) operated and controlled by us from which you
    are accessing this Privacy Policy
    (each, the "<strong>Site</strong>"). By providing personal information to us or by using the Site, you agree to the
    terms and conditions of this Privacy
    Policy.
</p>

<h2>INFORMATION COLLECTION</h2>

<h3>Information You Provide</h3>

<p>
    Some areas of the Site may ask you to submit personal information in order for you to benefit from the specified
    features (such as newsletter
    subscriptions, tips/pointers, or order processing) or to participate in a particular activity (such as sweepstakes
    or other promotions). You will be
    informed what information is required and what information is optional.
</p>

<p>
    We may combine the information you submit with other information we have collected from you, whether on- or offline,
    including, for example, your purchase
    history. We may also combine it with information we receive about you from other sources, such as other Johnson
    &amp; Johnson Operating Companies, publicly
    available information sources (including information from your publicly available social media profiles), and other
    third-parties.
</p>

<h3>Passive Information Collection and Use</h3>

<p>
    As you navigate around the Site, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without your
    actively providing the information), using
    various technologies. We and our third-party service providers passively collect and use information in a variety of
    ways, including:
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Through your browser</strong>: Certain information is collected by most browsers, such as your Media Access
    Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen
    resolution, operating system version, and Internet browser type and version. We may collect similar information,
    such as your device type and identifier,
    if you access the Site through a mobile device.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Using cookies</strong>: Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer you are using.
    Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent
    on the Site, pages visited, and language preferences. We and our service providers use the information for security
    purposes, to facilitate navigation,
    display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while using the Site. We also use cookies
    to recognize your computer or device,
    which makes your use of the Site easier, such as to remember what is in your shopping cart. In addition, we use
    cookies to gather statistical information
    about Site usage in order to continually improve its design and functionality, understand how individuals use it,
    and to assist us with resolving questions
    regarding it. Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to
    you and display them while you are on
    the Site. We may also use cookies in online advertising to track consumer responses to our advertisements.
</p>

<p>
    You can refuse to accept these cookies by following your browser's instructions; however, if you do not accept them,
    you may experience some inconvenience
    in your use of the Site. You may also not receive advertising or other offers from us that are relevant to your
    interests and needs. To learn more about
    cookies, please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Using Flash cookies</strong>: Our use of Adobe Flash technology (including Flash Local Stored Objects
    ("Flash LSOs")) allows us to, among other things, serve you with more tailored
    information, facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Site, and collect and store information about your use
    of the Site. If you do not want Flash
    LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the
    tools contained in the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">Website
    Storage Settings Panel</a>. You can also
    control Flash LSOs by going to the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html">Global
    Storage Settings Panel</a> and following the
    instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred
    to as "information" on the Macromedia
    site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player
    8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs
    that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time). Please note that setting the Flash
    Player to restrict or limit acceptance
    of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash
    applications used in connection with the
    Site or our online content.
</p>

    <strong>Using pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, or other similar technologies</strong>: These may be used in
    connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, track the actions of Site
    users and
    e-mail recipients, measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and compile statistics about Site usage and
    response rates.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Online behavioral advertising: </strong>
    The use of cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, or other similar technologies allows our third-party
    vendors to deliver advertisements about our
    products and services when you visit the Site or other web sites or web properties across the Internet. These

    identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of
    the visit and the page(s) that were

    We use IP Addresses for purposes such as
    calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Site.

    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In addition, we use and disclose information collected through the Site as we believe to be necessary or
    appropriate: (a) as permitted by applicable law,
    including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from

</p>

<h2>THIRD-PARTY SITES AND SERVICES</h2>

<p>
    This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices
    of any third-parties, including any
    third-party operating any site or web property (including, without limitation, any application) that is available
    through this Site or to which this Site
    contains a link. The availability of, or inclusion of a link to, any such site or property on the Site does not
    imply endorsement of it by us or by our
    affiliates.
</p>

<h2>SECURITY</h2>

<p>
    We use reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect personal information under our
    control. Unfortunately, no data
    transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to
    believe that your interaction with us is
    no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you have with us has been compromised),
    please immediately notify us of the
    problem by contacting us in accordance with the <em>"Contacting Us"</em> section below.
