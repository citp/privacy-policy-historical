We use tracking information to determine which areas our site users visit based on traffic to those areas. JangoMail does not track what individual users read, but rather how often each page is visited. This helps us maintain a superior and informative website for you. 

  


### The Information We Collect

Our registration forms require users to give us contact information that may include name, email address, address, and facts about your company size, and similar information.

### Tell-A-Friend

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friendâ€™s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. JangoMail stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one time email and tracking the success of referrals made through this program. 

  


### Import Contacts

We utilize an import contacts feature to help you keep in touch with your contacts and/or other subscribed members to your campaigns. We make it easy for you to connect with your data in a variety of formats so that you can use it to send campaigns to these contacts from our site.

Newsletters and other JangoMail communications may include tracking technologies that allow us to see when messages have been opened, links clicked, and pages in our own web site visited as a response to the emailing. 

  


### Agents

We use an outside credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. This company does not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any other purpose. 

  


### Security Technology

JangoMail has made a substantial investment in the latest server, database, backup and firewall technologies to protect our information assets. These technologies are deployed as part of sophisticated security architecture. All data resides in a tightly controlled, secure data center. These investments mean that information about the identity and preferences of individual members is never accessible to anyone outside JangoMail. We will maintain safeguards to protect the security of these servers and your personally identifiable information. 

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, follow this link: <http://www.thawte.com/resources/ssl-information-center/get-started-with-ssl/index.html>. 

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

  


### Widgets

Widgets support functions that require that you disclose certain personally identifiable information, given the userâ€™s choice of participation. This information is collected in many different ways such as: forms, surveys, contests, forums, subscribing or unsubscribing to mailings, and correcting or updating personally identifiable information and are only used for the purpose in which they were collected. Forms which require sensitive information such as financial information (credit card) to process purchases for products or services are SSL encrypted to protect your sensitive information.
