# Privacy Policy | Janssen

**Last Updated: June 2015**

**Janssen Global Services, LLC,** is concerned about privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use, and disclose information. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we or our service providers collect through the Web site operated and controlled by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy (the “ **Site** ”). By providing personal information to us or by using the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

Local Country Subsites

The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies operate globally through a number of separately constituted and regulated legal entities in countries around the world.  A complete list of the Janssen local country or regional subsites can be found here. The content of this Site is owned and controlled by Janssen Global Services, but each of the local country or regional subsites is owned and controlled by the relevant Janssen entity that does business in that country or region. Each local country or regional subsite is governed by applicable local privacy laws and regulations and its own privacy policy, which is available on that local country or regional subsite.  If you choose to visit one of the local country or regional subsites from this Site, please review the Privacy Policy on that subsite.

INFORMATION COLLECTION

Information You Provide

Some areas of the Site may ask you to submit personal information in order for you to benefit from the specified features (such as newsletter subscriptions, or tips/pointers). You will be informed what information is required and what information is optional at the point of collection. You may also choose to submit personal information through the “Contact Us” section of this Site.

We may combine the information you submit with other information we have collected from you, whether on- or offline. We may also combine it with information we receive about you from other sources, such as other Johnson & Johnson Operating Companies, publicly available information sources (including information from your publicly available social media profiles), and other third parties.

Passive Information Collection and Use

As you navigate around the Site, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information), using various technologies. We and our third-party service providers passively collect and use information in a variety of ways, including:

**Through your browser:** Certain information is collected by most browsers, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system version, and Internet browser type and version. We may collect similar information, such as your device type, if you access the Site through a mobile device.

**Using cookies:** Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer you are using. Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Site, pages visited, and language preferences. We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation and to display information more effectively. We also use cookies to recognize your computer or device, which makes your use of the Site easier and makes the Site display properly on your device. In addition, we use cookies to gather statistical information about Site usage in order to continually improve its design and functionality, understand how individuals use it, and to assist us with resolving questions regarding it. Some of our cookies are managed for us by third parties.

You can refuse to accept these cookies by following your browser’s instructions; however, if you do not accept them, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Site. To learn more about cookies, please visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ "http://www.allaboutcookies.org")

**IP Address:** Your IP Address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider. An IP Address is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites. We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Site.

**Device Information:** We may collect information about your mobile device, such as a unique device identifier.

How We Use and Disclose Information

We use and disclose information you provide to us as described to you at the point of collection.

We may also use information from or about you:

  * to respond to your inquiries and fulfill your requests, such as to send you documents you request or e-mail alerts;
  * to send you important information regarding our relationship with you or regarding the Site, changes to our terms, conditions, and policies and/or other administrative information; and
  * for our business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing new products, enhancing our website, improving our products and services, identifying Site usage trends, personalizing your experience on the Site by presenting products and offers tailored to you, and determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns.

  * to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).



In addition, we may use and disclose information collected through the Site as we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) as permitted by, or required under, applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you, or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.

We may also use and disclose information we collect passively as described above, under “Passive Information Collection and Use,” and for any other purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law (for example, if we are required to treat such information as personal information). In addition, we may use and disclose information that is not in personally identifiable form for any purpose. If we combine information that is not in personally identifiable form with information that is (such as combining your name with your geographical location), we will treat the combined information as personal information as long as it is combined.

California Do-Not-Track Disclosure

We do not track our users over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and, therefore, the Site does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.

THIRD-PARTY SITES AND SERVICES

This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of any third parties, including any third-party operating any site or web property (including, without limitation, any application) that is available through this Site or to which this Site contains a link. The availability of, or inclusion of a link to, any such site or property on the Site does not imply endorsement of it by us or by our affiliates.

SECURITY

We use reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect personal information under our control. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the _“Contacting Us”_ section below.

Where we do transfer your personal information to our affiliates or our contracted services providers based outside of your country of residence we ensure, by means such as contracts and personal data transfer agreements, that your personal data is reasonably protected in accordance with applicable privacy laws, regulations or binding codes.

SENSITIVE INFORMATION

Unless we specifically request or invite it, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal information ( _e.g.,_ information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Site or otherwise to us. In those cases where we may request or invite you to provide sensitive information, we will do so with your express consent.
