            <p>

            Welcome to JanRain.com.  We take your privacy seriously, and want

            <h3>Here are our commitments</h3>
            <p>
            </p><ul>
              <li>Your privacy remains strictly under your control</li>
              
              <li>We will never disclose your information to any third party for marketing purposes unless you expressly tell us to </li>
              <li>You can decide whether you want to receive any offers from us that may be of interest to you</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>

            <h3>Information Practices</h3>
            <p>
            As a visitor to JanRain.com you can undertake any activities without providing any personal information.
            In the following three sections, we explain what information is collected, how it is used to your benefit, and the choices that you have with your information.
            </p>

            <h3>Information Collected by JanRain</h3>

            </p><p>


            </p><h3>Use of Information</h3>
            <p>
            If provided, we will use your email address to contact you from time to time.  You can control the types and frequencies of certain emails you receive, although you agree that we may always contact you to provide you with important information or required notices required by JanRain.com.

            Cookies are a standard Internet technology, and many major web sites use them to provide useful features for their members. Cookies allow us to store and retrieve login information on a user's system. They provide us with data that we can use to improve the quality of our service and make it easier to use.

Please keep in mind that no personally identifiable information concerning users is conveyed to any advertiser when ads are served based on keywords. 
            </p>

            <p>
            We may determine categories of interests expressed by our users that we aggregate on a non-personally identifiable level. This aggregated "category of interest" information will enable us to improve our functionality, features, and offers of interest to our users. We will not disclose any personally-identifiable information such as, name, age, or email address to a third party, including advertisers.
