Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Customers.

Notice and Choice: Individuals may submit personal information to our customers through the use of the website registration and login services we provide to our customers. (Some of these services may have a notice that they are “powered by Janrain”). This personal information is submitted with notice to, and the consent of, the individual user via identity providers’ permission screens, or voluntarily provided by the user at registration. Once Janrain has successfully facilitated the transmission of personal information to a customer’s database that is not hosted by Janrain, it is that customer’s responsibility to guard any the personal information against unauthorized access or transmission.

Our Role Processing and Protecting Customer Data: As part of our Janrain Customer Identity Management Platform™, we may receive and host on our customers’ behalf such personal information and other data a customer may provide to us for hosting (collectively, “Customer Data”). Our customers are the data controllers of Customer Data. As the processors of personal information on behalf of our customers, we follow their instructions with respect to the information they control. In doing so, we implement appropriate technical, physical and administrative measures against unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of, or damage to, personal information. We do not determine how our customers use Customer Data, and we will not access or disclose it except as directed by our customers or required by law.

Accessing, Correcting, Amending, or Deleting Personal Information: If you are an individual seeking access to, or who would like to correct, amend, or delete your personal information which Janrain may be storing on behalf of our customer, you should direct your request to the applicable Janrain customer acting as the data controller for such information. Customers may access and delete Customer Data, including an individual record, via an application provider interface or API. If requested to remove/access data we will respond within 30 days. Following the deletion of personal information in a database we host, the related backup data will be deleted, generally within 30 days.
