This Privacy Statement covers the information practices of Janrain websites sites that link to this Privacy Statement, including [http://www.janrain.com](http://www.janrain.com/); <http://janrain.com/>; <http://trust.janrain.com/>; <https://rpxnow.com/privacy>; and <https://janraincapture.com/>. These websites are hosted in the United States.

Our websites may contain links to non-Janrain websites. We are not responsible for the information practices or the content of such other websites. We invite you to review the privacy statements of those other websites to understand their information.

### 2\. Consent

By providing personal information to our websites, you consent to its use in accordance with this Privacy Statement and, if you live outside the U.S., you consent to the transfer of such information to the U.S. In particular, we post testimonials on Janrain’s websites that contain information such as Client names and titles. Salesforce.com obtains the consent of each Client prior to posting any information on such a list or posting testimonials. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at [privacy@janrain.com](mailto:privacy@janrain.com).

### 3\. Personal Information We Collect

  * **Information You Give Us**



We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or give us in any other way. This information may include (a) your name, email address, and other personal information; (b) your interaction with website features; (c) transaction-related information, such as, when you download software from us; and (d) information you provide us when you contact us for assistance.

  * **Information We Collect Automatically and Cookies**



Janrain and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service.

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site.

  * **Behavioral Targeting**



We partner with third parties to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish not to have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) (or if located in the European Union click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.

  * **Do-Not-Track**



There are different ways you can prevent your online activity being tracked. One of those is setting a preference in your browser that alerts websites you visit that you do not want them to collect certain information about you. This is referred to as a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) signal. Please note that our websites may not recognize or take action in response to DNT signals from web browsers. At this time, there is no universally-accepted standard for what a company should do when a DNT signal is detected. In the event a final standard is established, we will assess how to appropriately respond to these signals.

For more detailed information about cookies, Do-Not-Track and other tracking technologies, please visit allaboutcookies.org and allaboutdnt.com.

Our site also includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.

**.**     Third Party Service Providers: We may retain other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as sending email, removing repetitive and inaccurate information from customer lists, analyzing data, processing credit cards, and providing marketing assistance. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

**.**     Some of our pages utilize framing techniques to serve content to and from our partners while preserving the look and feel of our site. Please be aware that you are providing your personal information to these third parties and not to Janrain.

**.**     Protecting Others and Ourselves: We will disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process and if we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, property, or safety, our customer, or others. In particular, we may cooperate with law enforcement agencies in any official investigation and disclose your personal information to the relevant agency in doing so.

**.**     Business Transfer: We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event Janrain, Inc. or substantially all of our assets are acquired. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

### 7\. Security

Janrain uses a secure infrastructure, industry standard technology, and appropriate technical and operational safeguards designed to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of data submitted to Janrain. When you enter sensitive information (such as login credential or credit card number) on our forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

The security of your personal information also depends on your protection of your account. Please do not disclose your website login credentials to unauthorized people. Also, be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. If you have any other questions about the security of our websites, please contact us using the contact information provided below in the “Contacting Us” section.

### 8\. Client Data

Janrain collects information under the direction of its Clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. If you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients that use our service, please contact the Client that you interact with directly. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Clients.

An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the Janrain’s Client (the data controller). If requested to remove data we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed to provide services to our Client. Janrain will retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Notice and Choice: Individuals may submit personal information to our customers through the use of the website registration and login services we provide to our Clients. (Some of these services may have a notice that they are “powered by Janrain”). This personal information is submitted with notice to, and the consent of, the individual user via identity providers’ permission screens, or voluntarily provided by the user at registration. Once Janrain has successfully facilitated the transmission of personal information to a Client’s database that is not hosted by Janrain, it is that Clients’s responsibility to guard the personal information against unauthorized access or transmission.

Our Role Processing and Protecting Client Data: As part of our Janrain Customer Identity and Access Management Platform, we may receive and host on our Clients’ behalf such personal information and other data a customer may provide to us for hosting (collectively, “Client Data”). Our Clients are the data controllers of Client Data. As the processors of personal information on behalf of our customers, we follow their instructions with respect to the information they control. In doing so, we implement appropriate technical, physical and administrative measures against unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of, or damage to, personal information. We do not determine how our Clients use Client Data, and we will not access or disclose it except as directed or agreed to by our customers or required by law.

Accessing, Correcting, Amending, or Deleting Personal Information: If you are an individual seeking access to, or who would like to correct, amend, or delete your personal information which Janrain may be storing on behalf of our Client, you should direct your request to the applicable Janrain Client acting as the data controller for such information. Clients may access, and delete Client Data, including an individual record, via an application provider interface or API. If requested to remove/access data we will respond within 30 days. Following the deletion of personal information in a database we host, the related backup data will be deleted, generally within 30 days. Janrain will retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
