### What are cookies?

A cookie is a small text document often including an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site’s computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it. However, to protect your privacy your browser only permits a site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses.

### Are you able to identify me in any way?

No. Cookies and the logs that we keep only log browser type, basic IP address information, operation systems and time stamps. We also don’t run any newsletter subscriptions. We don’t require any form of obligatory login or registration from you.

Thus said, please keep in mind that if you decide to participate in our comment section and reveal information about yourself, this data can be read and used by anyone who has viewed your comments. We are not responsible for any personal information you share on this website on your own.
