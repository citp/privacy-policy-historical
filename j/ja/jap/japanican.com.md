The JTB Group’s corporate philosophy is to “ _contribute to harmony and understanding throughout the global society through the creation of multicultural human exchange_ ” based on ‘The JTB Way’, the quintessence of our brand.

Our Group-wide business and operational strategies are formulated based on this philosophy. We consider the aligned management and utilization of Group assets (capital, brands, IT systems, etc.) as critical to the realization of JTB Group objectives and view the safeguarding of personal information and compliance with applicable privacy laws as essential to the achievement of our philosophy and objectives. To this end, we have developed the following policies and procedures:

  * 1\. We shall create a system and procedures for handling and managing personal information that conform to the standards set forth under JIS Q 15001. All officers and employees of JTB Corp. shall be required to comply with said system and procedures.

This means that we shall collect personal information through lawful and proper means and shall limit the use, furnishing and handling of personal information to the scope of its intended purpose. Should the need arise to handle personal information in a manner that goes beyond the scope of its specified intended use, we shall do so only after obtaining authorization from our Privacy Officer, furnishing notice to the affected individual regarding the contemplated use of said information, and obtaining the consent of said individual. We shall not utilize personal information for non-intended purposes and shall establish mechanisms to safeguard against such non-intended use. We shall only use and furnish ‘Specific Personal Information’ for its intended purposes as defined under the Act on the Use of Numbers to Identify a Specific Individual in Administrative Procedures.
