CHOICE REGARDING COLLECTION, USE, AND DISTRIBUTION OF PERSONAL DATA. You can choose whether to provide Personal Data to us, but note that you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services if they require Personal Data that you have not provided. You can sign-up, and therefore consent, to receive email or newsletter communications from us.

If we are processing your Personal Data based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by emailing such request to info@japancrate.com.
