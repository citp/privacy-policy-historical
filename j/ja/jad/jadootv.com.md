# Privacy Policy | JadooTV

In various places on the Sites and through the JadooTV products, we collect “Personally Identifiable Information” such as your name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, or other information that can be used to identify you or contact you. For example, we collect this information when you create an account, register for our message boards, sign up for our email newsletter, and purchase from our website or register a JadooTV product, download a software update, enter a sweepstakes or participate in surveys, promotions and give-away. From time to time in the future we may offer software updates, upgrades, additional features, services and promotional opportunities that would require you to submit Personally Identifiable Information to participate.

We also collect “Anonymous Information” such as your IP address, the type of browser you use, the pages on our Sites that you visit, the search terms that you enter or the advertisements that you click. Anonymous information can and will NOT be associated with Personally Identifiable Information.

Like many Internet sites, we also use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer and is stored on your hard drive. When you visit our Sites the cookie identifies your computer to us so that you do not have to re-register each time you visit. We also use cookies to measure the traffic to and usage of our site and its different services and features, and other miscellaneous uses.

We also collect the personal information of third parties that is provided by visitors who submit that personal data through our Sites, in connection with, for example, referrals or gift purchases.

JadooTV products upload usage information to JadooTV as part of their normal functioning. The collected information includes the specific identifiers of streams played, duration played, various quality measures, error logs, software version numbers, and other usage statistics. Usage information uploaded from JadooTV products is personally identifiable by product serial number. In some cases, serial numbers are associated with personally identifiable information for customer service and support.

The information collected from many users is aggregated for analysis and, in some instances, made generally available anonymously to users of JadooTV products and JadooTV services. For example, JadooTV may use such information to provide features such as lists of popular videos. JadooTV may also use personally identifiable information to make content recommendations to individual users.

If you do not wish JadooTV to use your information as described in this section, please follow the procedure in “What Choices You Have” below.

We do not intend that children will use the Sites. We do not solicit or knowingly collect information from children under 13 years of age, nor will we accept registration from them.
