<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
  JadooTV Inc. respects your privacy. This Privacy Statement explains  what information we collect through our websites (the "Sites"), through  our products and when you contact us for support, how we use that  information, and what choices you have.<br>
        <br>
The Sites may contain links to other web sites. This Privacy Statement  does not apply to the practices of any company or individual that  JadooTV Inc. does not control, or any web sites that you link to from  the Sites. You should carefully review the privacy policies of any web  sites that you visit from ours to learn more about their information  and privacy practices. The collection and use of your personal  information shall be governed by such other party or site's privacy  policy. JadooTV Inc. is not responsible for their privacy practices.<br>
<br>
Please take a few moments to read this Privacy Statement. By accessing  the Sites or using a JadooTV product, you agree to accept the terms and  conditions of this Privacy Statement and are aware that our policies  may change in the future.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>What information we collect</strong><br>
          In various places on the Sites and through the JadooTV products, we  collect "Personally Identifiable Information" such as your name,  mailing address, telephone number, email address, or other information  that can be used to identify you or contact you. For example, we  collect this information when you create an account, register for our  message boards, sign up for our email newsletter, and purchase from our  website or register a JadooTV product, download a software update,  enter a sweepstakes or participate in surveys, promotions and  give-away. From time to time in the future we may offer software  updates, upgrades, additional features, services and promotional  opportunities that would require you to submit Personally Identifiable  Information to participate.<br>
          <br>
          We also collect "Anonymous Information" such as your IP address, the  type of browser you use, the pages on our Sites that you visit, the  search terms that you enter or the advertisements that you click.  Anonymous information can and will NOT be associated with Personally  Identifiable Information.<br>
          <br>
          Like many Internet sites, we also use "cookies" to collect information.  A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer and is  stored on your hard drive. When you visit our Sites the cookie  identifies your computer to us so that you do not have to re-register  each time you visit. We also use cookies to measure the traffic to and  usage of our site and its different services and features, and other  miscellaneous uses.<br>
          <br>
We also collect the personal information of third parties that is  provided by visitors who submit that personal data through our Sites,  in connection with, for example, referrals or gift purchases.<br>
<br>
JadooTV products upload usage information to JadooTV as part of their  normal functioning. The collected information includes the specific  identifiers of streams played, duration played, various quality  measures, error logs, software version numbers, and other usage  statistics. Usage information uploaded from JadooTV products is  personally identifiable by product serial number. In some cases, serial  numbers are associated with personally identifiable information for  customer service and support.<br>
<br>
The information collected from many users is aggregated for analysis  and, in some instances, made generally available anonymously to users  of JadooTV products and JadooTV services. For example, JadooTV may use  such information to provide features such as lists of popular videos.  JadooTV may also use personally identifiable information to make  content recommendations to individual users.<br>
<br>
If you do not wish JadooTV to use your information as described in this  section, please follow the procedure in "What Choices You Have" below.<br>
<br>
We do not intend that children will use the Sites. We do not solicit or  knowingly collect information from children under 13 years of age, nor  will we accept registration from them.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>How we use the information we collect<br>
  </strong>We use Personally Identifiable Information that you provided us to  perform the services for which the data was collected, such as for  order fulfillment, customer support and marketing activities, such as  e-mail newsletters and sending you information about products and  services that may be of interest to you. Later on in this Privacy  Statement, we provide you with more information on how to opt-out of  marketing communications.<br>
  <br>
We use non-Personally Identifiable Information to determine how people  use the Sites and its services and to analyze usage and performance of  our products and their software and features. For example this data  tells us information including how often users click on our  advertisements, which files are downloaded most frequently, and which  areas of our site are the most popular. Analyzing this data allows us  to improve our products and services.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>How we share information</strong><br>
  We sometimes use third parties to help with certain aspects of our  operations, such as processing credit card payments and providing  marketing assistance. When we supply Personally Identifiable  Information to these third parties, we require them to use it only for  the function they are contracted to perform.<br>
  <br>
We aggregate the Anonymous Information that we collect and exchange it  with advertisers and others who are interested in our services.<br>
<br>
We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information as required by  law, or if in our judgment it is necessary to protect JadooTV Inc. or  our users from loss or liability. We may share some or all of your  personal information with our current or future "affiliates" (which  means a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other  companies under a common control), in which case we will require our  affiliates to honor this privacy policy. If we merge with or are  acquired by another company, the resulting combined company will use  the information you have provided as described in this policy. If we  cease operation, your information may be transferred to and used by  another company that offers similar or related products or services.  While we cannot predict about such an unlikely event, we would hope  this could provide you continuity of service.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>What choices you have<br>
  </strong>If you do not want to receive information about our products and  services or do not want to receive information from our partners and  others about products and services that might interest you, you can  send an email to JadooTV Inc. at privacy@jadootv.com. This e-mail address  is being protected from spambots, you need JavaScript enabled to view  it . We will keep track of your decision in our database. Even if you  choose not to receive information from us, we reserve the right to  communicate with you on matters we consider especially important  relating to our products or services.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Postings</strong><br>
  If you register to use our bulletin boards, please remember that  anything you post is publicly available. Your profile will also be  available to other users of our bulletin board service.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Security</strong><br>
  During sessions in which you give us information such as credit card  numbers, we encrypt your transmissions using SSL ("Secure Sockets  Layer"), and other security technology. This guards against the  interception of the information while it is on the Internet. We keep  the Personally Identifiable Information you provide on servers that are  protected by firewalls and other technological means against intrusion  or unauthorized access. They are located in a physically secure  facility, and only our employees and agents with a need to know the  information are given access. However, there is no such thing as  "perfect security" on the Internet. We rely on you to select passwords  that cannot be guessed easily and to safeguard those passwords from  disclosure. Third parties may unlawfully access transmissions or  private communications. Please contact us if you have any information  regarding unauthorized use of the Sites.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Questions<br>
  </strong>If you have questions about this Privacy Statement or our policies, please contact JadooTV Inc. at <a href="mailto:privacy@jadootv.com">privacy@jadootv.com</a><br>
