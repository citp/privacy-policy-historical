Privacy Policy

  
ATTENTION: PLEASE READ THESE PRIVACY TERMS AND CONDITIONS BEFORE ACCESSING THIS WEB SITE, AND BEFORE SUBMITTING INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH ANY APPLICATION FOR EMPLOYMENT. ACCESSING THIS WEB SITE OR SUBMITTING EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION INDICATES THAT YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT ACCESS THIS WEB SITE AND DO NOT SUBMIT ANY EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION. 

To measure our visitors' interest in and use of various areas of our Site, including any advertising, we may rely upon aggregate information -- which is information that does not identify you. This information may be gathered by so-called “cookies” or "clear GIF" files. With this aggregate information, we may undertake or commission statistical and other summary analyses of our visitors' behavior and characteristics. Although we may share this aggregate information with third parties, rest assured that no aggregate information we provide to third parties will allow anyone to identify you, or determine anything personal about you.

**1\. Employment Submissions; Use Of Personal Information**  
Our web site (the “Site”) allows users to submit resumes and other information for purposes of seeking employment with Jabil Circuit, Inc., its affiliates and subsidiaries (“Jabil” or “we” or “us”). By using our Site to submit this information, you are authorizing us to use “personal information” contained in your submission in the manner we deem necessary or advisable for purposes of processing your request to be considered for employment. By "personal information" we mean information that can be used by someone to identify or contact you, such as your name, e-mail address, or mailing address. In addition, if you provide us with references, and we decide to contact such references, we may disclose personal information in connection with such contacts. 

In sum, we use personal information for the purposes for which you provided the information. In addition, we may use this information to notify you of new opportunities or other developments at Jabil. If you do not wish to receive this additional information, please send an e-mail to that effect to [webmaster@jabil.com](mailto:webmaster@jabil.com). 

**2\. Consideration of Employment Submissions  
** We have created the portion of our Site that allows submission of employment applications in order to assist prospective applicants in submitting applications, and to assist us in collecting these applications. Due to the nature of the Internet and the structure of the Site, we may receive substantially more applications than we wish to review, we may receive applications which do not meet the requirements for positions that are available, and we may receive applications at points where no positions are currently available. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will process or review materials you submit seeking employment with Jabil, and we expressly disclaim any obligation to engage in such processing or review. 

Jabil believes that all applicants and employees are entitled to equal employment opportunity. Each applicant and employee is recruited, employed, evaluated, and considered for promotions without regard to his or her race, color, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, age, marital status, mental or physical disability, veteran’s status, or any other category protected by law. 

**3\. No Third Party Unassociated With Your Application Is Given Access to Personal Information**   
Except in connection with checking references you may provide to us, we do not share with third parties any personal information you provide to us. By "third parties" we mean anyone who is not involved in running the Jabil Site, or in the processing, evaluation, or consideration of your request to be considered for employment. 

**4\. Privacy Protection for Children**   
Our Site is not directed at children, and we will not accept or request personal information from individuals we know to be under 13. 

**5\. Exceptions**   
There are two exceptions to our privacy policy. First, we may release or use personal information in connection with legal proceedings or inquiries, or in response to a subpoena or court order, or in connection with compliance matters. Second, our policy only applies to information you provide to us. You may provide third parties with information if you, for example, choose to participate in an online discussion, or click on third-party links we may provide at our Site. In addition, if we contact references you provide in connection with your request for consideration of employment, these references may learn certain of your personal information. We cannot be responsible for the conduct of these third parties. They may have policies or practices concerning privacy that differ substantially from ours, and you may receive unsolicited messages or other contacts due to this conduct. 

**6\. User Submissions; Evaluation And Content Of User Submissions  
** All comments, submissions, employment material, or other information which you may choose to provide to us in connection with your use of this Site (collectively, “Submissions”) shall be and remain the property of Jabil. Jabil shall be free to use, without restriction and without compensation to you, any ideas, concepts, know-how, suggestions, or techniques contained in any Submissions you send to the Site for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to developing, manufacturing and marketing products or services using such information. 

Jabil has no obligation to respond to any Submissions, and we reserve the right, but undertake no duty, to review, edit, move, or delete any material posted by users on the Site, in our sole discretion and without notice. 

You are prohibited from posting or transmitting any advertising, "spam," or unlawful, threatening, defamatory, obscene, scandalous, inflammatory, pornographic, or profane materials, or any material that could constitute or encourage conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any law. You are also prohibited from: posting material or information that is copyrighted, unless you are the copyright owner or have the permission of the copyright owner to post it; posting material that reveals trade secrets, unless you own the or have the permission of the owner; posting material that infringes on any other intellectual property rights of others or on the privacy or publicity rights of others. Jabil disclaims all responsibility or liability arising from the content of any such postings and assumes no responsibility for any error, defamation, libel, slander, omission, falsehood, obscenity, pornography, profanity, danger or inaccuracy contained in any information posted by users on the Site. Jabil will comply with subpoenas or court orders directing Jabil to disclose the identity of users posting such information or materials, or otherwise directing compliance by Jabil. 

You agree to refrain from any activity that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionate load on the Site. In addition, you may not use any hardware, software or routines, including but not limited to any viruses, “bots” or other devices intended to interrupt or harm the workings of the Site, and agree to refrain from any attempt to intercept, access or monitor any system, data or information on or in transit to or from the Site. 

We reserve the sole and absolute discretion to deny, revoke or otherwise restrict the access privileges of any user that at any time fails to comply with the restrictions contained in this Section. 

**7\. Security of Information**  
We have put in place security control systems designed to prevent unauthorized disclosure of your personal information. We do not, however, provide any assurances as to the security of your information, and expressly disclaim any such obligations. 

**8\. Assignment**   
In the event that Jabil may wish to assign or transfer your personal information and its rights hereunder to a third party, you agree that Jabil may do so, on the condition that such third party agrees to abide by Jabil's applicable Terms and Conditions concerning privacy. 

**9\. Termination  
** You may terminate your consideration for employment with us at any time by withdrawing your request for employment consideration and refraining from visiting our Site. We may terminate these Terms and Conditions and immediately deny you access to the Site if, in our sole discretion, we conclude that your activities, postings, or other conduct in connection with the Site are inappropriate or in breach of these Terms and Conditions. 

**10\. Choice of Law and Jurisdiction  
** These Privacy Terms and Conditions shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to any conflict of law provisions, and any dispute arising under these Terms and Conditions shall be resolved exclusively by the state or federal courts sitting in Pinellas County, Florida.
