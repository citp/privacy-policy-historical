to identify you, either directly or in combination with other information that we possess. Your personal data may include for example your name, your contact details, information relating to purchases or information on how you use our websites and apps or how you interact with us. We collect personal data from you, for example when you use our websites and our apps, use our services or contact us.

#### The data we collect

We collect and process the following categories of information about you:

  1. _Contact details_  
When you create an account on our website or when you purchase our products we will need your name, address and country, to be able to send the products to you. We also need your email to send order confirmations and order updates to you. We also collect your telephone number to contact you if you are not at home when the products are delivered at your address. There might be other reasons for us to have a need to contact you, such as when you use our Global Technical Support and when you participate in our contests or if you are a contact person for a business partner.
  2. _The communications you exchange with us_  
When you contact us, or when we respond to you on inquiries of all types we collect emails, letters, calls, messages or chats. The Jabra web site offers qualified resellers tools that enable them to personalize online product presentations to make it easier to access the information that is of most interest to their customers. When you create a personal product profile account, you create for yourself a user name and password for future access to your profile, and you provide Jabra with personal contact information such as your name, address, phone, and e-mail address. Your user name, password and personal information will not be shared with other organizations. 
  3. _User IDs and Passwords_  
Provides you with access to your profile areas on our web shops. 
  4. _Information about payments_  
When purchasing products at Jabra’s websites, we cooperate with a third-party payment provider. We will not have access to your payments details, so here we refer you to the payment providers privacy policies.
  5. _R &D Tests_  
Our User Experience Team performs surveys and analytics to provide you with better products in the future to come. If you volunteer to one of these tests, we will ask you to sign a consent letter which specifies the purpose and the data we collect. Normally we would collect your contact details (ref. A), as well as data related to that specific test. This could be opinions, interpretations, preferences, biometric data and fitness data. This data will be pseudonymized before it is shared within the project team and will be anonymized once the project no longer need to be able to go back to you (e.g. when the new product is launched).
  6. _Use of data cookies_  
Like many others, Jabra uses cookies. Cookies enables us to provide a better user experience, so any features on the Jabra sites are dependent on using and storing cookies. You can see our policy on our website.
  7. _Internet Protocol Reporting_  
Jabra uses your IP (Internet Protocol) address to monitor web site traffic and to help diagnose problems with our server. We do not use IP addresses to personally identify users. Jabra does use a log file of IP addresses to determine which areas of our site visitors like based on the volume of traffic and on aggregate geographic data. This information is used to better prepare future site content and design based on the interests of users.
  8. _Apps_  
We kindly refer you to our privacy policy for applications, which can be found on our websites and in the apps.
  9. _Opting Out and unsubscribe_  
We provide users the opportunity to opt out of receiving any further communications from Jabra when they receive distributions via e-mail. At the end of each email message, instructions on how to unsubscribe and be removed from the mailing list database are included. Jabra gives users the option of contacting Jabra at any time to remove their information from our database or to stop receiving future electronic distributions.
  10. _Sensitive personal data_  
We also collect sensitive data as defined in the EU GDPR. For Jabra sensitive data is related to our Sports products, which is categorized as Fitness data (alias health data). In addition, we use sensitive data in R&D which is biometric data and data about human race. 



#### Collection of personal data

Personal data is collected either directly from you, such as through the product registration process, the employee application process or other processes where you allow Jabra to collect, process and store your information, or data is collected from you via partner entities or subsidiaries where you have provided them with consent. E.g. when ordering products on Jabra.com the payment process is done by a 3rd party specialized in these transactions. Only data used to forward you the products you paid for is forward to us. Personal data could also be collected from third parties which may include LinkedIn and Facebook. Finally, data could be collected without your knowledge, such as device-specific information (your mobile devices unique device ID or Lap-top id, the type of device you use, the IP address of your device, Bluetooth name, Bluetooth MAC address and your operating system). The purpose of collecting this last category is to optimize headset sound as well as provide you with the best possible user experience when visiting our sites.

Jabra does not intentionally collect personal data from anyone under the age of 16. Nor do we entice children to divulge any personal data, by means of special prizes or games. Jabra web site visitors must be at least 18 years old to participate in any Jabra sponsored on-line contests or giveaways. Jabra encourages parents to participate actively in their children’s Internet experience. If Jabra learns that the company has obtained personal data pertaining to a child under the age of 16, the information will be deleted from the database. 

#### Purposes and legal basis for processing of personal data

Jabra limits its collection, storing and processing of personal data to situations where a specific purpose exists. With reference to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we have listed the most relevant purposes and the legal basis together with some of the activities associated with those purposes: We process your personal data on the following legal bases: 

EU GDPR Article 6.1.a (Consent) is used when you activate the opt-in function in our apps, subscribe on our emails, you provide us with feedback etc. Here you provide us with your consent to obtain and process relevant personal data and/or to send you emails.

EU GDPR Article 6.1.b (Necessary for the performance of the contract between you and Jabra) is used when it is necessary for Jabra to have your personal data to send you products (e.g. ordering at Jabra.com), help you in our service and support desk, etc.

EU GDPR Article 6.1.c (Necessary for Jabra to comply with a legal obligation). The legal obligation could be related to tax & duty, but there could also be other reasons why Jabra is obligated to deliver personal data to the authorities.

EU GDPR Article 6.1.f (Necessary for the pursuit of legitimate purposes of us) is used when we collect information (above called “device information”, “app number” and “log information”) about the services you use and how you use them. This then enables Jabra to identify the need to enhance existing apps and develop new applications. We collect this data to provide, maintain, protect and improve the services. Ref. the previously mentioned, this could be information about features that are used, how often they are used and the context they are used in.

EU GDPR Article 9.2.a (explicit consent) is used when the opt-in functions in our apps is activated. Jabra fitness data is a form of health data and thereby sensitive data. When you enable this functionality, you provide us with relevant health data directly and you provide us with your consent to obtain this personal data. It could also be in relation to projects where consent has been provided to obtain biometric data for R&D purposes.

#### Recipients of personal data
