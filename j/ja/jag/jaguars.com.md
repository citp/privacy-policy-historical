We also may collect certain information automatically when you visit the Services, including:

          whenever you access the Internet and that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area;
          we also use IP addresses for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our
          advertisers and sponsors, for example regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of
          our sites. We may combine this information with other personally identifiable information, such as name,
          telephone number, email, age, or address, which will be used in accordance with Section 2 of this Privacy

Cookies are similar to standard cookies except that they can be larger and are downloaded to a computer or mobile
device by the Adobe Flash media player. Please note that you may need to take additional steps beyond changing
your browser settings to refuse or disable Local Shared Objects and similar technologies. For example, Local Shared

by configuring your preferences or options in your browser. However, if you choose to reject cookies and similar

As true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may
include IP addresses, browser type, ISP, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream

address. We collect this information to help us improve our website and to deliver a more personalized service. At

downloaded. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information
you submit within the Mobile App.

We have adopted security procedures to help protect against loss, misuse, and unauthorized access to the
information you provide to us. For example, if we collect financial information, we will use encryption software to
help protect this information when it is in transit. Please note, however, that no data transmission or storage can be
guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot
guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to the Services and cannot be
responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information.
7.   CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
The Services do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 13. If we

10. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request certain information regarding our
disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request,
please contact us by phone at 904-633-6000 or write us at Jacksonville Jaguars, LLC, 1 EverBank Field Drive,

In some cases, third parties may be able to collect information about a user’s online activities over time and across
different websites when the user uses our Services.
Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user
communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always
clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because
there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such
signals, we currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and
accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.
11. INTERNATIONAL USERS
Please note that the Services are directed towards users who reside in the United States. By using the Services, you
consent to the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of your information in and to the United States, or other
countries and territories, pursuant to the laws of the United States. While some of these countries may not offer
the same level of privacy protection as your own, we commit to uphold the privacy protections as explained in this
Policy.
