**Email Communications:** When you open emails from us, we may receive a confirmation noting you opened the email, if your computer supports such capabilities. We also may keep track of what emails we send you and what emails you may be receiving from our subsidiaries and affiliates.  Additionally, we keep a record of what communications you have opted to receive or not to receive. 

## HOW INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED

We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Website, including but not limited to those described below:

**Registration:** You may be asked to complete a registration form and provide personally identifiable information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features the Website may choose to offer, such as newsletters or contests.  Participation in registration is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website.

**Newsletters and Website Emails:** We offer free newsletters to share information with you about the Website, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our marketing partners and advertisers and sponsors.  You may receive a newsletter either by registering for a particular newsletter or in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you have registered on the Website.  Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website.  You may also cancel your free email subscription by following the instructions provided on the Website or in the newsletter or email.

**Contests or Sweepstakes:** We periodically operate contests and sweepstakes through the Website that may require registration or the submission of personal information.  Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website.  Your personally identifiable information may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other related purposes, (see the rules of each contest for details about how your personal information will be used).  We may also ask your permission to allow us to publicly post some of your information on the Website, such as on a winnerâ€™s page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes.  Except as required by applicable law, we will not post your information without your permission.

**Surveys or Voting:** From time-to-time we may request personally identifiable information from you in conjunction with a survey or voting poll. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website. 

**Cookies:**   As with many Websites, our Website uses a technology called "cookies."  A cookie is a unique, random number that is stored in the browser on your computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify you, just the computer that is used to visit the site. Cookies automatically identify your browser to the Website whenever your computer is used to visit the Website.  Cookies also let us know how many people visit our website and where visitors go on the site. In addition, cookies can let us know non-personally identifiable information, like what web browser is being used to access the website. For registered users, cookies can make using the Website easier for you by saving information such as your passwords or preferences.  By tracking how and when you use the Website, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Website are based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on the Website. Cookies may also allow the Website to present to you advertising which may be of interest to you. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, your browser should contain an option that allows you to disable or delete cookie data at any time.  Some areas of the Website, however, may not provide you with a personalized experience if you have disabled the use of cookies. These cookies are not tied to personal information.

**Web Beacons and Other Tracking Technology:**  Our Website uses a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including Web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of Web sites. We also use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our Web sites, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our Web sites. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine whether our guests have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods is not collected in a form that is personally identifiable. 

**IP Addresses and Click-Stream Data:** We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data. An IP address is a number associated with the service through which you access the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors, for example regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our sites. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information.  Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when you request Web pages from the Website. Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Website, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.

**Transaction Information:** If you conduct a financial transaction with our Website, such as paying your annual invoice or buying tickets, we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information from you, including contact information, demographic information and financial information.  We will use this information to complete the transaction that you have requested, i.e., to deliver the information, products or other services that you order, and to invoice you.  For your protection, such information is collected through encrypted means.

## HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED

As applicable, the information you provide to us may be used to:  
contact you about the Website;   
contact you relating to your membership status;   
confirm or fulfill an order you have made;   
inform you of a prize you have won;  
monitor or improve the use of the Website;   
customize the advertising and content you see;   
monitor compliance with our terms and conditions of use of the Website; and  
send you promotional material or special offers on behalf of our marketing partners and/or their respective affiliates and subsidiaries and other third parties.

## WITH WHOM THE INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED

At times, we may share your personal information with others for various purposes.  The following outlines the ways in which your information may be shared with others and the ways in which you may opt-out of having your information shared:

**Agents:** We employ other businesses, certain services and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, Website analysis, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They may have access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for their own purposes, like sending you marketing offers about their products.  Jaguars.com uses framing techniques to provide our users a seamless experience. Some pages may have the look and feel of the Jaguars site, such as pages by Football Fanatics, Channel 1 Media, and Bellina Technologies but to be aware that these pages are actually hosted by a 3rd party company and any information submitted here is being submitted directly to that 3rd party.

**Aggregate Information:** We may share aggregate information, such as demographics and Website usage statistics, with advertisers, sponsors or other organizations. When this type of information is shared, the other parties do not have access to your personally identifiable information.

**Other Promotional Offers:**   We may send offers to you on behalf of our marketing partners. When we do this, we do not give that partner your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, you use the opt out method detailed in the email or change your preferences by logging into your account.

**Business Transfers:**   In the event that all or substantially all of our assets are sold or transferred to another party, or another transaction occurs in which your personally identifiable information is one of the business assets transferred, all personally identifiable information that has been collected and saved may be one of the business assets we transfer.  Please see "YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRIVACY POLICY AND NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES TO THE POLICY" section below.

**Administrative or Legal Process:**   Your personal information may be transferred to third parties without notice to you in order to comply with applicable law, law enforcement agencies, to protect our rights, or protect the rights of other users of this website. 

## CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS AND MESSAGE BOARDS

The Website may make chat rooms, forums and message boards available to its users. You are not required to provide any personal information when using these areas but you may choose to do so. If you post personal information online, it will be publicly available and you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. We cannot ensure the security of any information you choose to make public in a chat room, forum, or message board. Also, we cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these areas.  See "A Special Note for Parents Concerning Privacy" section below.

## LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES

You should be aware that when you are on the Website you could be directed to other Websites beyond our control. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" may take you off the Website onto a different Website. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and marketing partners that may use the Website's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other Websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a Website that is linked to our Website, you should consult that Website's privacy policy before providing any personal information. 

## SECURITY

This Website incorporates reasonable safeguards to protect the security, integrity, completeness, accuracy and privacy of the personal information that we may collect and we have put into place reasonable precautions to protect such information from loss, misuse and alteration. Your personally identifiable information is transferred to our computers utilizing encryption software.

Some activities offered on jaguars.com/mb might disclose some of your childâ€™s personal information to third-parties on the Internet, such as the message boards.  Before allowing your child to use a feature of our website that might result in the disclosure of the childâ€™s information to third-parties on the Internet, we require an authorization form signed by a parent to confirm that the parent has given permission for the childâ€™s participation in such activity

**Parental Approval, Consent and Review**

When a child signs up for an activity where we collect and save personally identifiable information, such as multiple email updates, they will be required to provide only their name, email address and a parent's email address. We ask for a parent's email address so we can help moms and dads stay aware of their children's online activities as described above.    
Parents at any time can send an email to [privacy [at] jaguars.com](mailto:privacy@jaguars.com)  to review the information collected about your child, request that it be deleted, or request that your children be removed from mailing lists. 

**Other Privacy Information**

We will only use personally identifiable information collected on jaguars.com/mb for the purpose for which it is collected.
