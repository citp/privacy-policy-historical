**WHAT INFORMATION MIGHT BE COLLECTED BY JAGUAR WEB SITES OR VIA THIRD PARTY WEBSITES OR PLATFORMS?**

At Jaguar, we intend to give you as much control as possible over your personal information. In general, you can visit Jaguar on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and address. It is our intent to let you know before we collect information from you on the Internet. 

Even before registration we will collect anonymous information about how you have used the Web Site. This is a common standard procedure for any Web Site on the Internet. The information collected does not personally identify you but may be helpful to us for marketing purposes or improving the services we provide. 

To improve the services we provide we will also collect anonymous information about the referring website (for example Google search) or the referring banner which lead you to Jaguar.com website. 

If you choose to give the Jaguar personal information via the Internet that we may need to correspond with you or provide you with a subscription, for example - it is our intent to let you know how we will use such information. If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes. 

**HOW WILL JAGUAR COLLECT AND STORE THIS INFORMATION?**

Jaguar can collect information about you in a number of ways; either directly requesting it from you (as on a registration form) or by automatically recording information about your visit to this Site. For example we might collect data regarding your journey through the Site or record the options that you have chosen to take. Jaguar may also collect your data via third party sites or platforms such as Twitter, Jaguar will only use reputable third party platforms in order to collect your data and will ensure that it takes all practicable steps to ensure the security of your data once it has passed to us from the control of the relevant third party but the third party will be liable for the security of your data until the completion of the transfer process. 

Information is stored in a secure environment protected by a combination of physical and technical measures. There is no general public access to this information. 

Jaguar will store this information in a secure and protected environment for as long as we believe it will better help us to understand how we can serve you, and respect your wishes.

**WHERE WILL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION BE STORED?**

Jaguar operates in many countries across the world. To enable us to offer consistent service to you, our customers, wherever you may be, we manage our Internet sites from one central site. This is currently in the United States of America. 

There is not one set of data protection law that covers both Europe and the United States of America, and the European laws require you to give your unambiguous consent to us before we can transfer and store your personal data in the United States. 

We need this information to help us improve our services to you; we want to make it easier to tailor our products and services to your particular needs. 

**WHO DOES THIS POLICY APPLY TO?**

This policy applies to web sites designed for the use of individual consumers and corporate visitors.

Protecting the privacy of children is important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our web site from those we actually know are under 13.

Elsewhere, you are simply given the option of cancelling your membership of the service. In other cases where you need to correct Personal Information you have submitted previously to a Jaguar Site please follow the instructions provided.

Personal Information collected by Jaguar Sites is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. In some cases, the Personal Information is encrypted before you conduct your transaction, using appropriate secure technology. 

**WHAT HAPPENS IF I CHOOSE NOT TO REGISTER?**
