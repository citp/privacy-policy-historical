This document describes how the Jaguar NA website located at www.jaguarusa.com (the "Website") collects and uses personally identifiable information and other data about you. This includes information and data you provide us as well as information and data we may collect about your site usage patterns.

## NORMAL WEBSITE USAGE

The information we collect and store during usage of this Website is the name of your Internet service provider, the website that referred you to us, the pages you request and the date and time of those requests. We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity to improve the usefulness of customer visits. During normal website usage, we do not collect or store personally identifiable information such as name, mailing address, email address, phone number or social security number. 

## COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

There are instances on the Jaguar NA Website where you may need to provide personally identifiable information in order to receive a specific product or service, such as a vehicle brochure or contest entry. This information, such as name, mailing address, email address, vehicle identification number (VIN), type of request and possibly additional information, is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data by Jaguar NA or its partners or affiliates and is used to fulfill your request. If you tell us at the time that you provide information, that the information should not be used as a basis for further contact, we will respect your request. The information you provide is used by Jaguar NA to improve the services we provide you. This data may be provided to our partners and affiliates for their use. This information may also be provided to our agencies for use on behalf of Jaguar NA in accordance with our proscribed privacy policy. In addition, unless you tell us otherwise, information you provide may be shared with an authorized Jaguar NA Dealer so that we may better serve your needs. Aside from the above, it is never provided or sold to any other company for that company's independent use. 

## ELECTRONIC MAIL SENT TO US THAT CONTAINS PERSONAL INFORMATION

We will use this information for the purpose identified in the email and to enhance our understanding of you in order to improve our service to you.

## USE OF COOKIES

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come; the "lifetime" of the cookie; and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. Cookies can help a website to arrange content to match your preferred interests more quickly - most major websites use cookies. Cookies alone cannot be used to identify you.

Three types of cookies are used on this website:

Session Cookies, which are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the site. These cookies allow you to carry information across pages of our site and avoid having to re-enter information. Within registration, they allow you to access stored information.

Persistent Cookies, which remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie.) These cookies help us recognize you as a unique visitor (using a number, you cannot be identified personally) when you return to our website. They also allow us to tailor content or advertisements to match your preferred interests or to avoid showing you the same adverts repeatedly. Finally, they enable us to compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how users use our site and to help us improve the structure of our website. We cannot identify you personally in this way.

Third Party Cookies; Third parties serve cookies via the website. These are used for the following purposes:  
 \- To serve advertisements on our site and track whether these advertisements are clicked on by users.   
 \- To control how often you are shown a particular advertisement.   
 \- To tailor content to your preferences.  
 \- To count the number of anonymous users of our site.   
 \- To provide security within shopping baskets or transactions.

You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)

This Website uses 'cookies' to simulate a continuous connection to our Website. This makes it easier and more convenient for you to find information that may have interested you in a previous session. It also allows us to provide you with a more personalized experience and provide you with information that is relevant to you. These 'cookies' contain information about your patterns of Website usage and may be connected to personally identifiable information you provide us. They are not connected to any personally identifiable information you may provide any other website. We may also use data collected through the use of 'cookies' for website analysis and design. This information may be provided to our agencies for use on behalf of Jaguar NA in accordance with our proscribed privacy policy. It is never provided or sold to any other company for that company's independent use.

## WEB BEACONS AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGY

This Website uses a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including Web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of websites. We also use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on this Website, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of the Website. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine whether our guests have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is personally identifiable.

## IP ADDRESSES AND CLICK-STREAM DATA

We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data. An IP address is a number associated with the service through which you access the Internet, like your Internet service provider, your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information, for example regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of the Website. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information we obtain from you directly on the Website. 

## LINKS TO OTHER SITES

This Website may provide links to third party websites not controlled by Jaguar NA, such as those belonging to Jaguar NA dealers, third party vehicle purchase sites, or third party product review sites. It is recommended that you check the specific privacy statements of those websites before providing any personally identifiable information.  We are not responsible for the policies and practices of other entities, and any information you submit to those entities’ or their websites is subject to their privacy policies.

## OUR POLICY REGARDING CHILDREN

The Website is a general audience website.  We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children aged thirteen or under.

## CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY

This privacy policy is effective as of June 16th, 2009.  We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy.  A revised Privacy Policy will only apply to data collected subsequent to its effective date.  Any revisions will be posted at least 10 days prior to its effective date.
