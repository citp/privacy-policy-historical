## **1\. Definitions**

"De-identified Information" means information that is no longer associated with you, or linked to your Personal Information (as defined below). De-identified Information does not reference the identities of individual persons.

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a web site, including our web site, sends to your computer or to your mobile device while you are viewing a web site. We use both session Cookies (which expire after you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personalized and interactive experience on our web site. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of our web site may not work properly.

An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases, your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session, but if you use a consumer internet service provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We track IP Addresses in conjunction with session cookies to analyze our web page traffic flow.

"Personal Information" is information about you that is linked to you as an individual, such as your name, postal address, email address, phone number, credit card number and expiration date, gift recipients, as well as other non-public information that is associated with that information. Personal Information does not include technical information such as unique device identifiers, randomly assigned unique identifiers in cookies, mobile device name, or IP addresses.

As more fully detailed below, we and our business partners obtain and keep Personal Information when you send us an email, order product, purchase product, sign up for our Preferred Customer program, supply information to our Career Center, or communicate with us.

## **4\. How We Use Personal Information**

We use your Personal Information to respond to requests that you make, to help us serve you better, and to provide you with a personalized web site experience. If you have signed up to receive email from us, we also use your Personal Information to provide you with promotional emails for our products, and for other marketing and advertising purposes.

For example, based on your shopping habits when you visit our web site (what items you browse, what items you place in your shopping cart, and what items you purchase), or based on your shopping habits when you purchase items in our store, we and our marketing partner(s), on our behalf, may send you personalized advertisements that identify products we think you may be interested in.

We limit our employees' access to Personal Information to those employees with a business reason for knowing such information, and those employees will use the information only for business reasons.

We may create De-identified Information from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the information personally identifiable to you.

Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, rent, or share your Personal Information with third parties. When you purchase a product or a service from our web site, or when you special order a product or service from our stores, we will share Personal Information with third party fulfillment companies in the United States, in order to deliver the product or service to you. We also share your Personal Information with third party service providers in the United States that provide advertising and marketing services for us, including distribution of postal mail, electronic alerts, email, electronic advertisements, and mobile text messages to our customers and potential customers.

We reserve the right to share some or all of your Personal Information with our subsidiaries, joint ventures, and other companies in the United States under the common control of Jo-Ann (collectively, "Affiliates"), for the purposes described in this policy. We will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.

Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Information, we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with laws or to respond to subpoenas or other judicial orders served on us, or (b) to protect and defend the rights or property of Jo-Ann or third parties.

## **6\. Advertising**

We use "interest-based" advertisements, also known as "online behavioral advertising." Online behavioral advertising is advertising that is directed to you based, at least in part, on your Internet browsing behavior across the World Wide Web. We may share Personal Information with the third parties that conduct advertising operations on our behalf. Third parties and their affiliates collect certain information as a result of their "tags" being on our website. The information that they collect includes the name (URL) of the web pages you view while on our site, your IP address, time of visit, information about your browser software, information about your device, and randomly-assigned identifiers stored in Cookies, which they use to target and serve advertising.

Some third parties involved in advertising operations may maintain their own proprietary consumer databases that allow them to personally identify or track website visitors. Other third parties have proprietary technologies to determine what additional devices you may use, on which it can display relevant advertisements.

Do-Not-Track is a public-private initiative that has developed a “flag” or signal that an internet user may activate in the user’s browser software to notify websites that the user does not wish to be “tracked” by third parties as defined by the initiative. For more information, visit <http://www.w3.org/2011/tracking-protection/>.

The Do-Not-Track initiative has not agreed on the actions that should be taken by the web sites that receive the “do not track” signal, and therefore Do-Not-Track is not yet standardized. As required by Section 22575 of the California Business and Professions Code, the following disclosure is made to California residents and to residents of other states: Our web site does not alter its behavior or change its services when it receives a “do-not-track” flag or signal from your browser. As described in Section 3, "How and Why We Collect Personal Information," we use Cookies and other tools to collect information about you when you visit our web site to better tailor the features, performance and support of our products, services and web site. After you leave our web site, we do not track your online activity on other web sites, but third parties (and their affiliates) may track your online activity to offer you advertisements. This tracking is anonymous and is not linked to your Personal Information.

You can make decisions about your privacy and the ads you receive. You can control whether companies serve you on-line behavioral advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance website and using its opt-out: <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>. The DAA opt-out requires that cookies not be blocked in your browser.

As an alternative to the DAA opt–out, you can also elect to block all Cookies from first parties (such as those from our website) and Cookies from third parties (such as advertisers) by using the cookie blocking options built into your browser software. For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you can block both first–party and third-party cookies by selecting those options at Tools/Internet Options/Privacy/Settings-Advanced/Override Automatic Cookie Handling. Also, if you are using Firefox 25, you can "uncheck" Accept All Cookies under Firefox Preferences/Privacy-Use Custom Settings For History/Accept Cookies from Sites. If you block Cookies, some parts of our website may not function correctly.

We use a third party service provider to manage our product review system. When you submit product reviews on our website, our third party service provider may place Cookies on your browser and offer advertising to you. For more information on how this provider uses your information, please visit this link: <http://go.bazaarvoice.com/848PGD1740001EG001ipQ00>
