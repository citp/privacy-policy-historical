### Privacy Policy

At Joann.com®, your trust and satisfaction is our top priority. We know your privacy is very important, and that is why we take special care to safeguard the confidentiality and security of your information. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of the information that you submit to us through our web site.

The web site is maintained in the state of Ohio in the United States and by submitting your personal information through the web site, you are agreeing to the collection and storage of that information in the United States.

This Privacy Policy is divided into the following sections:

##### 1\. Definitions

"Anonymous Information" means information that is not associated with you, or linked to your Personal Information. Anonymous Information does not permit the identification of individual persons.

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a web site, including our web site, Joann.com®, sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a web site. We use both session Cookies (which expire after you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personalized and interactive experience on the web site. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of the web site may not work properly.

An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases, your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session, but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We track IP Addresses in conjunction with session cookies to analyze our web page traffic flow.

"Personal Information" is information about you that is linked, or that can be linked, to you as an individual, such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, credit card number and expiration date, gift recipients, as well as other non-public information that is associated with that information. We and our business partners obtain and often keep this information when you send us an e-mail, purchase product, request to be added to our direct mail or e-mail lists, supply information to our Career Center, or communicate with our Customer Service department or communicate with our online Community.

Whenever we use the words "we" or "us," we are referring to Joann.com, LLC. Whenever we use the words "our web site," we are referring to [http://www.joann.com.](http://www.joann.com/)

##### 2\. Consent to Joann.com®

When you submit Personal Information and Anonymous Information to our web site, it means that you have agreed to the terms of this Privacy Policy and that you expressly consent to the use of your Personal Information in the United States, according to this Privacy Policy.

Please note that your Personal Information may be used by Joann.com® in the country where it was collected, as well as the United States, where laws regarding the use of Personal Information may be less strict than the laws in your country.

##### 3\. How and Why We Collect Personal Information

The Personal Information we gather from you helps us learn about visitors to our web site, our customers, and our potential customers. We use this Personal Information to better tailor the features, performance and support of our products and services, and to offer you additional information if you have consented to receive it.

We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily to our web site in the following ways:

  * When you register on the web site to set up an account, we collect your name, postal address, and telephone number (both for billing and for shipping purposes), your account username, password, e-mail address, and credit card information (number, type of card [Visa, MasterCard, etc.] and expiration date).
  * When you sign up to get information about special savings by e-mail or to receive store sales flyers (direct mail), we will collect your e-mail address and your postal address. We also ask for additional voluntary information, such as hobbies and interests, to better provide you with relevant offerings.
  * When you purchase a gift card, we will collect the name of the recipient (including yourself, if you are buying the card for yourself), and either the e-mail address and your personalized e-mail message to the recipient, or the postal address of the recipient, depending on whether you send an electronic gift card or a physical gift card. 
  * When you sign up for our Community, we will collect your username, password, e-mail address, and your date of birth. 
  * When you sign up to become an advertiser, we will collect your name, company name, e-mail address and comments you have.
  * When you contact us by e-mail, we will collect your name, e-mail address, and any information contained in the e-mail that you send us. 
  * When you enter a sweepstakes, we will collect your name, postal address, country and e-mail address.

This information is made available only to our employees involved in the recruitment process, and it is used only for recruitment purposes. Employees of our third party service provider have access to the Personal Information, but they are subject to the same privacy protection requirements as our employees, and they may use the information only for the purpose of providing us with technical support. (This paragraph is not applicable in Canada as currently, there are no Jo-Ann store locations in Canada).
  * When you sign up to receive text messages, we will collect your mobile telephone number, in order to send you the text messages. We also will collect your name and zip code if you choose to provide it. For more information about text messages from Jo-Ann and how to stop them, go to this link: [www.joann.com/SMS](https://web.archive.org/web/20130925022137id_/http://www.joann.com/privacyPolicy/www.joann.com/sms/)
  * When we receive Personal Information from you from other sources like postal mail, telephone or fax, then we will add this information to the information we have already collected from you.



We also collect Personal Information from you involuntarily, through the use of technology, without you taking steps to submit that information, whenever you use our website for any purpose (shopping, submitting a request to customer service, searching the career center, etc.), in the following ways:

  * As you navigate our web site, we collect information including your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, and operating system.

##### 4\. How We Use Personal Information

We use your Personal Information to respond to requests that you make, to help us serve you better, and to provide you with a personalized web site experience. If you have signed up to receive electronic communications from us, we also use your Personal Information to provide you with promotional e-mails for our products, and for other marketing and advertising purposes.

For example, based on your shopping habits when you visit our web site (what items you browse, what items you place in your shopping cart, and what items you purchase), we may send you personalized advertisements that identify products we think you may be interested in. We may also use your shopping habits to send you personalized e-mail product alerts.

We limit our employees' access to Personal Information to those employees with a business reason for knowing such information, and those employees will use the information only for appropriate business reasons.

We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the information personally identifiable to you. We may use this Anonymous Information to analyze request patterns and usage patterns so that we may enhance our products and services. As this Anonymous Information does not identify you, we may use and disclose Anonymous Information to third parties at our discretion.

If you provide feedback on any of our products and services, we may use your feedback for any purpose. We will collect any information contained in your communication and will treat the Personal Information in the communication in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
