### Summary

AkeebaBackup.com is committed to protecting you and your personal information when you are using our services. We want our services to safe and enjoyable environments for our users. This Privacy Policy is relevant to our use of any personal information you provide to us during your visit to our site.

AkeebaBackup.com seeks to follow the industry's best practices concerning personal information handling.

The website contains hyperlinks to external resources, hosted and operated by third parties. These parties have their own privacy policies, including cookies, and we urge you to review them carefully. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the handling of your personal information when visiting these external resources; your use of those third party resources and/or websites is your own responsibility.

We also use third-party service and content providers (such as Google AdSense, Google Analytics and Disqus) who may collect their own set of personal information. Since these are third parties, the information collected by them is not governed by this Privacy Statement. Take a look at the Cookies section towards the bottom of this document for more information.

### Personal information collected

Whenever you register for our members-only services, for example using our forum or registering for our newsletter, we may ask personal information about you. This can consist of such information as your name, e-mail, website address, gender, etc. By entering the information in the fields requested you enable AkeebaBackup.com to provide you with the services you select. 

We record your IP address as part of the unconditional logging our web server software does whenever anybody accesses our site. The collected IP addresses remain on record for at least a year, but they will be not shared with third parties. Exception to this rule is sharing information with authorities in the case of a suspected or proven breach of our site or other proven misuse of our services.

This website is also using "cookies" to enhance user experience. Please read the relevant chapter to find out more about our use of cookies.

### Use of collected information

AkeebaBackup.com will NOT sell, rent or otherwise willingly transmit the recorded personal information to any third party. Your privacy is important to us and we will not even offer aggregate information resulting from personal information processing to any part outside AkeebaBackup.com. We only use the recorded personal information for:

  * service administration purposes, e.g. sending you password reminders, registration confirmations, billing subscription services etc.;
  * to contact you regarding new content added on our website, e.g. new forum posts, if you have opted in for this sort of communication;
  * to personalize your experience, through the storage of your preferences in cookies and/or our site's database;
  * analyze the use of our website and improve its usability;
  * IP addresses may be used to identify the location of users, the number of visits from different cities / territories / countries or filter and block inappropriate use.



If AkeebaBackup.com wishes to use the recorded personal information for other uses, it will notify you beforehand so that you have the chance to opt-out from these new uses.

### When we contact you

We only contact you if you have explicitly opted-in for such communication through the use of our services. For example:

  * We may contact you if a new post was added to a forum thread you have subscribed to
  * We will send you a personalized copy of our newsletter if you have opted-in for it



These forms of contact are conducted by automated software running on our server. You always have the chance to opt-out from such communication. AkeebaBackup.com will never send unsolicited email messages ("spam") or allow third parties access to our users and contacts database.

We may also directly contact you - manually sending out emails, as opposed to automatic email sending outlined above - under special circumstances such as:

  * Suspecting that your account is compromised by an unauthorized third party
  * Before, during or after server-related incidents which may seriously hamper your ability to use our services
  * In case you have crossed the line of fair use of our services
  * If you have so asked us with an email, forum post, personal message, instant message, Twitter message or any other form of personal or electronic contact.



### Contact for marketing purposes

_Important note_ : Please review the section on cookies, as we employ third-party service/content providers. These providers collect their own set of personal information, governed by their own privacy statements.

Exceptions to this rule will be clearly stated and will only be part of a special offer campaign. For instance, we may launch a campaign offering subscriptions to third party services for free or with a discount. If we are to collect and share your personal information you will be informed before opting in to that campaign.
