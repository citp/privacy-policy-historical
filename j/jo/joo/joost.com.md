## Managing Your Information Preferences

You can always review, correct, update, or change your personal information, or opt out of our direct marketing efforts, by changing the relevant setting in your Joost profile or account (if available), or by e-mailing us at [privacy@joost.com](mailto:privacy@joost.com). If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please e-mail us at [privacy@joost.com](mailto:privacy@joost.com).

## Information We Collect

### Registration and Your Personal Profile

When you register with the Site or the Service, you provide us with certain personal information, such as a username (which may or may not be your real name), email address, gender, zip/postal code and date of birth. The decision to provide this information is optional. However, if you choose not provide the requested information, you may not be able to use certain features of the Site or Services.

When you use the Site or the Services, you will have the option of setting up a personal profile by providing general information about yourself, the URL of your website, address of your blog and a mood message. Additionally, when using the Site or the Services, you will have the option to form relationships, send messages to your friends and other users, perform searches and queries, form groups, add applications, comment on particular content, and transmit information through various channels.

### Cookies

Like many websites, we employ "cookies" in certain areas of the Site to allow us to provide information which is targeted to your interests and to make your online experience more convenient. Cookies are small bits of electronic information that a website sends to a visitor's browser and are stored on the visitor's hard drive. We use cookies for the following purposes:

  * to store a user's log-in identity so that your session won't expire unless you actively log out
  * to keep a record of the programming or advertisements you were watching when you last left the Site
  * to keep a record of any widgets or other additional applications that you have installed.



Certain third parties will also place and read cookies in your browser. Further information on this can be found below in the section "Third Parties Who Collect And Receive Your Information".

You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however, if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Site or the Services. For further information on cookies and how to disable cookies, please visit [www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/). 

### Log Information

We also keep track of your interaction with the Site, the Services, and other users. Specifically, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit the Site or Services. This information includes your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and version, which features you use and when and how long you use them, what programming and advertising you view and share with friends and how long you view it, your browsing history on the Site and the Services (including any links that you may click within the Site or the Services), your search history, and any social connections you have (i.e., your friends and the groups you have joined).

### Slurping

You will have the opportunity to connect with friends from your other networks, such as AOL, Gmail, LinkedIn, Hotmail, Netlog and Yahoo.

The Site will identify the email addresses of the friends in your other networks, and if any of these friends are already Joost® users, we will offer you the opportunity to connect as friends on Joost®, and if you choose to do so, a friend request will be sent by email. If any of your friends are not Joost® users, we will enable you to invite those friends to join Joost®. You will be able to select those friends in your other networks that you wish to invite (if any), and Joost will send one email on your behalf to each of these friends inviting them to visit the Site and register as a Joost® user. If any of your friends respond to your invitation, and subsequently register as Joost® users, you will offered the opportunity to connect as friends on Joost®. If you choose to connect, a friend request will be sent by email.

After this process is complete, and any email invitation(s) have been sent, your friends' email addresses will be deleted from our servers (unless they have registered separately as Joost® users). We will not retain or use these email addresses for any purpose whatsoever, and will not contact your friends or create any connections unless you ask us to.

If your email address appears in anyone else's network, Joost may use your email address for the purposes described above.
