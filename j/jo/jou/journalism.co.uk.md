# Privacy policy | Journalism.co.uk

We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this policy sets out how we will treat your personal information

 **(1) What information do we collect?**

We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal data:

(a) information about your computer and about your visits to and use of this website (including your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit and number of page views);

(b) information relating to any transactions carried out between you and us on or in relation to this website, including information relating to any purchases you make of our goods or services (including advertising in our directory of freelance journalists, advertising vacancies on our jobs board, training course bookings and display advertising);

(c) information that you provide to us for the purpose of registering with us (including registration with our bulletin board, our links directory, our blogs and for the purpose of posting press releases, placing recruitment adverts, submitting tips, posting items to our full-time and short course sections and gaining a listing in our freelance directory);

(d) information that you provide to us for the purpose of subscribing to our website services, email notifications and/or newsletters (including our daily email newsletter, email notifications of job vacancies and notifications of our training courses);

(e) any other information that you choose to send to us.

 **(2) Cookies**

A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. 

We use both "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies on the website. We will use the session cookies to: keep track of you whilst you navigate the website; and keep you logged in to administrative areas of the site. We will use the persistent cookies to remember your display preferences.

Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.

We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers. The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information. Google's privacy policy is available at: <http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html>.

Our advertisers/payment services providers may also send you cookies. Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our sites and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.co.uk/privacy_ads.html).

Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies.  (For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking "Tools", "Internet Options", "Privacy", and selecting "Block all cookies" using the sliding selector.) This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.
