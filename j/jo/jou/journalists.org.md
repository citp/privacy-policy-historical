Online News Association, including any affiliates and subsidiaries (“ONA,” “we,” “us,” “our”) values the trust you place in us when you use ONA’s website and our affiliated websites, or online tools and services (collectively, our “Websites”). This Privacy Policy describes our collection, use, disclosure, and protection of your information. This Privacy Policy applies to our Websites that link to it, regardless of how you access or use them, including through mobile devices. Certain ONA Websites, such as the Career Center, may follow different or additional privacy policies and terms and conditions (and will link to those policies and terms). To the extent that those policies and terms differ from this Privacy Policy and the ONA [Terms and Conditions](https://journalists.org/about/accountability/policies/terms-of-use/), the policies and terms of those ONA Websites will govern.

BY USING OUR SERVICES AND/OR REGISTERING WITH US, YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR [TERMS AND CONDITIONS](https://journalists.org/about/accountability/policies/terms-of-use/), AND YOU ARE CONSENTING TO OUR COLLECTION, USE, DISCLOSURE, AND PROTECTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE THE INFORMATION WE REQUIRE, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ALL OF OUR SERVICES TO YOU.

If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Websites. We may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes to our Websites. Your continued use of our Websites following the posting of any changes will mean you accept those changes.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites and mobile applications that may link to the Websites or be linked to on the Websites. We are not responsible for the actions and privacy policies of third-party websites and applications; please consult these websites and applications directly to understand their privacy practices.

### How we use your information

For information about how to manage your information and the choices you have, see how to limit the use of your information below.

We also may use your information to:

We also may use or combine information that we collect offline or we collect or receive from third-party sources for many reasons, including to enhance, expand, and check the accuracy of our records.

### How we share your information with others

We share your personal information with third parties as described below. In addition, we may share information that does not specifically and personally identify you, such as aggregate information, device identifiers or other unique identifiers to third parties. For information about how to manage your information and the choices you have, see how to limit the use of your information below.

**Third-Party Service Providers:** We engage third-party service providers to perform functions on our behalf such as processing donations and other payments made to ONA. These third parties may have access to your personal information when needed to perform their functions.

**Business Partners:** We may share information that personally identifies you with business partners who provide products and services that we think you may be interested in.

**Sale, Assignment or Change of Control:** We may change our ownership or corporate organization while providing the Websites. We may transfer to another entity or its affiliates or service providers some or all information about you in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, acquisition, sale of assets or any line of business, change in ownership control, or financing transaction. Under such circumstances, we would request the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy Policy. Nevertheless, we cannot promise that an acquiring party or the merged entity will have the same privacy practices or treat your information the same as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Law Enforcement, Legal Process, and Emergency Situations:** We may also use or disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or on the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply with legal process served on us or our Websites; (b) protect and defend our rights or property, the Websites or our users, or (c) act to protect the personal safety of us, users of the Websites or the public. For example, if a third party alleges that you have infringed their intellectual property rights, we may disclose your information to that third party. Similarly, if you allege that your intellectual property rights are being infringed by a user posting content onto our Websites, we may disclose your information to that user.

### Public areas, interactive features and activities

Please remember that any information you share in public areas, such as comment sections to posted articles (“Public Social Features”), becomes public and anyone may take and use that information. Please be careful about what you disclose and do not post any information that you expect to keep private. Please consult the applicable guidelines, if any, for use of these features. ONA cannot control who views information that you post in public areas of the Websites and is not responsible for how third parties, including other users may use or disclose information that you post in public areas of the Websites or otherwise share with other users or third parties.

In order to verify your identity, you may be required to provide us with personal information prior to accessing any records containing information about you. We may not accommodate a request to change or delete personal information if we believe doing so would violate any law or legal requirement, or cause the information to be incorrect.

We will honor any legal right that you have to access, modify or erase your personal information. To request access and to find out whether any fees may apply, if permitted by applicable state, federal, or national law (outside of the United States), please contact [support@journalists.org](mailto:support@journalists.org).

### Cookies, tracking technology and interest-based advertising

Like many websites, we use tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to record your preferences, track the use of our Websites and exposure to our online advertisements.

They may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services.

These third parties may use these technologies to collect information about you when you use the Websites. They may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may also use persistent identifiers to track your Internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond the Websites. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based advertising or other targeted content. While we do not knowingly provide these entities with information that personally identifies you such third parties may, with sufficient data from other sources, be able to personally identify you, unknown to us.

**Online Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising Choices:**

You also have choices to limit some tracking mechanisms that collect information when you use the Websites. Many web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser’s setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, certain features of our Websites, including the Websites themselves, may not function properly or remain accessible to you. In addition, you may also render some web beacons unusable by rejecting or removing their associated cookies. Note that if you choose to remove cookies, you may remove opt-out cookies that affect your advertising preferences.

We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), on our Websites. Google Analytics uses cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with and use the Websites, compile reports on the Websites’ activity, and provide other services related to Websites activity and usage. The technologies used by Google may collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor, and any referring website. The Websites do not use Google Analytics to gather information that personally identifies you. The information generated by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to Google’s [privacy policies](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/).
