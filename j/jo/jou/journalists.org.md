# Welcome to ONA

**THE ONLINE NEWS ASSOCIATION PRIVACY POLICY**

The Online News Association ("ONA") respects the privacy of visitors to our site. Please read this privacy policy carefully so that you understand our privacy practices. If you have questions about the policy, please contact us at [privacy@journalists.org](mailto:privacy@journalists.org)

Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, e-mail addresses and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. We won't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personally identifying information.

The only personally identifying information that ONA gathers online is information that visitors to our site provide voluntarily, for example, when they apply for membership, register for conferences, request e-mail updates, or participate in surveys. Except as otherwise provided in this privacy policy, we will not sell, rent, or otherwise share personally identifying information about visitors to our site without their consent.

We may share visitor information with third parties working on our behalf. For example, we share visitor information with the vendors that assist us in accepting membership applications and conference registrations online or that help us administer our conferences. Our vendors may collect credit card information you provide in conjunction with the registration process. Our vendors have agreed not to share such personal information or to use it for purposes other than those for which we provide the information to those vendors. We also may use the information we collect to communicate with our members and/or former members, and on occasion, we may share such information with organizations and/or companies that wish to communicate with our members and/or former members for purposes that we believe are in keeping with ONA's basic mission.

We are currently using the services of a third-party vendor to assist with online membership registration and online registration for ONA conferences. You may review, update, or change your profile online by visiting the "member login" area on our Web site.

Each year, ONA recognizes outstanding online journalism through its Online Journalism Awards. If you submit your OJA entry online, you'll be asked to provide information about yourself (such as your name, address and e-mail address) so that we can contact you about your entry. We may share this information with any co-sponsor of the awards (identified in the rules). If you don't want us to collect the information requested in the OJA registration form or to provide it to our co-sponsor, please do not submit an OJA entry.

Our Web server automatically collects your IP address when you access pages of our Web site. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you. Your IP address does not tell us who you are.

We may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with the law or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our site, the public or ONA. In the unlikely event that ONA or substantially all of its assets are acquired by another organization or company, information on our visitors would be among the transferred assets.

Information gathered by ONA on our Web site is stored within ONA-controlled databases on servers maintained in protected environments. However, no physical or electronic security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our servers or databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.

The Web is an evolving medium. If we need to change our privacy policy at some point in the future, we'll post the changes before they take effect.
