# Privacy Policy | Journeys.com

**Terms of Use**  
Welcome to the Journeys Web Site ("Site"). The Site reflects the family of brands including Journeys, Journeys Kidz and Shi by Journeys (collectively “Journeys”). Please review the following basic rules that govern your use of our Site (the "Agreement"). Please note that your use of our Site means that you agree to these rules.

This Privacy Policy was lasted updated on: February 9, 2017.

**Changes to Privacy Policy**  
We may from time to time change these rules. We will notify users of the Site of any changes by posting the revised policy reflecting them with a new effective date on this page. Your use of our Site following any such change means that you agree to the rules as changed. These rules--specifically including the "Customer Information Policy", "Use of Cookies", "Use of IP Addresses", and "Security" paragraphs below--apply to this website only and not to any other website or business activity of Genesco Inc. or any of its divisions, including Journeys, Journeys Kidz and/or Shi by Journeys.

**Customer Information Policy**  
The Site is intended for audiences 13 years of age and above. All areas on the Journeys Site that accept personal information (email address, name, address, gender etc.) from a customer have an age verification field. If the customer is not 13 years of age or older, the information is not accepted or stored by the Site.

A parent or legal guardian who is over the age of 18 may register his or her child as a member of the Journeys Kidz Birthday Club. Birthday Club members may receive promotional offers and other information about Journeys Kidz at the address provided.

Journeys does collect customer information on those users who are 13 years of age or older in an effort to improve our customers' shopping experience. Journeys recognizes that it must maintain and use customer information responsibly. The information collected is used to help us respond to customer inquiries, send emails about sales and events, send catalogs and other marketing and promotional materials through the mail, contact contest winners and/or ship and bill orders. The information also helps us in determining what products appeal to our customers so we can better merchandise our site.

Journeys collects personal information necessary to process an order, a catalog request, a contest entry or a request to receive promotional emails from the consumer. This information includes name, address, city, state, zipcode, phone number, email address, gender (optional) and date of birth (optional). For those users who have opted to register their personal profile with the Site by setting up an “account”, the above information, including additional “Ship To” addresses, can be reviewed and maintained by the customer by accessing it through the “My Account” link in the top navigation bar of the Site’s pages. For those customers who have not registered a maintainable account on the site, they may contact Journeys customer service at 1-888-324-6356 to have their information updated as needed.

We may use customer information for marketing and promotional purposes. Each promotional email we send comes with a link that enables our customers to unsubscribe or remove themselves from our mailing list. In addition, we may from time to time make customer information available to other carefully screened companies. Categories of companies with which we may share information include other companies that we believe offer products and services that our customers may be interested in, either directly or through companies that market information about potential customers to other suppliers of products or services. If you would like to make sure that we make every effort not to share your email address or other information with third parties, just send an email to [journeysremove@genesco.com](mailto:journeysremove@genesco.com). Please specify which of the Journeys’ brands (Journeys, Journeys Kidz and/or Shi by Journeys) from which you would no longer like to receive messages.

When we offer contests or promotions, or join with other companies to do so, visitors who choose to participate in these contests and promotions may be asked to provide personal information to participate. That information may then be used by us and any company offering the contest or promotions to notify winners or to fulfill promotional obligations. We may use third parties to perform services such as mailing catalogs and other marketing and promotional materials on our behalf. We will supply customer information to those third parties to the extent necessary to enable them to perform the services we have engaged them to provide.

Third Party Integrated Solutions  
In addition to the third-party service providers discussed elsewhere in this policy, Journeys uses carfully selected third-party solution providers on its website to offer specific functionality that help improve the shopping experience for its customers.  As a result, there are occasions where the Site must share customer information with one or more of those providers in order for their software to function as expected and provide our customers with the expected benefit.  In addition to the third-party payment and email opt-in services which are made available through the site, Journeys currently uses the three third-party providers listed below, each of which has access to some customer information as described.  The companies listed have committed to Journeys to adhere to our Customer Information Policy and, in some cases, have also listed a link to their own company policy.

MyBuys:  
Journeys uses MyBuys to collect information regarding consumer preferences related to Journeys' products and the Site in order to merchandise the Site effectively and make product recommendations to the Site's customers.  MyBuys may use cookies and transparent GIF files to collect information on the Journeys' website as part of the service.  Consumers may review MyBuys' privacy policy at http://www.mybuys.com/privacy.html.

International Checkout:  
Journeys allows international shoppers to obtain our products through the use of International Checkout.  When a customer on the Site chooses the International Checkout option, the products in the Site's shopping cart are transferred to an International Checkout cart.  The transaction then takes place completely on the InternationalCheckout.com website.

**Your California Privacy Rights**  
California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as S.B. 27, allows our California customers to request certain information regarding our disclosures, if any, of personally identifiable information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us at either [journeysremove@genesco.com](mailto:journeysremove@genesco.com) or Genesco Retail Direct, Genesco Inc., 1415 Murfreesboro Rd, Suite 503, Nashville, TN 37217 and include your name and the address to which you would like us to respond.
