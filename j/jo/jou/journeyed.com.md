##### How We Protect Your Information

We employ the latest encryption and security technology and fraud detection techniques in all areas of JourneyEd.com where you provide us with personal or account information. This is done to protect you from unauthorized use of the information you are sending to our server.

For privacy purposes, once you give us any information relating to you, it is stored on a highly secure server that is not accessible via the Internet.

  


##### What Information Do We Collect and How Do We Use It?

When you visit our Web site, our server automatically recognizes your Internet Protocol address (IP address) or domain name. In order to enhance our Web site, we may track the way our visitors and customers are using the site. Personal information, such as your name and e-mail address, is not included in this analysis. Unless you provide it, we do not collect or know your name or e-mail address. We do not follow your browsing path outside of the JourneyEd.com network.

The information that you give us and information about your order may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) available from our records and other sources. This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. This information may also be shared with other marketers to bring you offers of interest. If you prefer that we do not share your name and address with other marketers, please email us at optout@JourneyEd.com.

In addition, like most other e-commerce Web sites, our site uses "cookies" -- small files placed temporarily in your Internet browser -- to keep track of your stay at our Web site. The text in a cookie, by itself, only tells us that you have visited our site before. When you place an order, request a catalog, or participate in a promotion or contest, we ask you to provide information including your name, postal address, e-mail address and, in the case of product orders, credit card number. Except to verify credit card information to complete your order, we do not use or release any credit card or financial information for any purpose.

If you provide us with your postal address, e-mail address or telephone number, you may receive our catalog or other promotional mailings, e-mails or telephone calls. If you receive an e-mail from us that you would rather not receive, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions set forth at the bottom of each e-mail. If you do not wish to receive our catalog, or other promotional, please write to us at the address set forth below or e-mail us at unsubscribe@journeyed.com. We will be happy to respect your request not to participate in our direct marketing programs.
