the messages sent to your friends may include your name, school network and profile photo. We

may send promotional email messages and SMS messages directly or in partnership with parties

other than Juxta. These messages notify you of application activity, provide application updates and

other relevant information and may allow you to use the applicable application on your phone. The

sending of SMS notifications may be handled through a third party service provider.

With your consent, we may send push notifications to your mobile device to provide application

updates and other relevant messages. You may be able to manage push notifications from the

applicable application or from your device’s settings. Some of our Services have direct messaging

potentially illegal activities, and enforce our Terms of Service.

navigate as well as to personalize the content provided on the Services.

**Product Improvement:** If you choose to download our apps, subscribe to our products, participate in

our online services, or to register for other Juxta products or services, we will collect the

information that you disclose and analyze the data to discover new facts that could help us better

understand our products and services. We may use this information for our internal business

purposes, such as research to improve our products and analyses that may help us better market our

products.

**Advertising, Marketing, and Promotions:** We may use your information for generating web

analytics to compile user information for marketing purposes, advertising, conducting marketing

analysis, providing you with recommendations for products or services based on your profile, and

deliver and target advertising, to notify users of application updates, to provide application leader

boards and promote application user achievements, to solicit input and feedback to improve our

products and services, and to inform users about new products or promotional offers.

#### **Sharing Your Information**

We may share your personal information, with third parties in the following circumstances:

Some of your profile information may be exposed publicly when you participate in the Services such as

by posting content, chatting with other users, or commenting on content. This includes: your name,

profile photos, username, school or network name, bio and descriptions of your activity.

Your information and your online communications may be accessed and monitored as necessary to

provide the Services and may be disclosed or reported: (i) if we have a good faith belief that we are

required to disclose the information by law, (ii) in response to legal process (for example, a court order,

search warrant or subpoena); (ii) to satisfy applicable laws, (iii) if we believe that the Services are being

used to commit a crime, (iii) including, but not limited to, to report such criminal activity or to

exchange information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and

credit risk reduction, (iv) if we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to

the health or safety of a person or the general public, and (v) in order to protect the rights or property of

Juxta, including to enforce our Terms of Service.

If you give us your consent, we may actively share personal information with third party advertisers for

their direct marketing purposes. We may share aggregated or anonymous information and certain

technical information to develop and deliver targeted advertising in the Services and on the websites of

third parties. We may also allow advertisers to collect those types of information within the Services

and they may share it with us. We may use this information for behavioral advertising and for web

analytics. Our collection, use, and disclosure of anonymous or aggregated information are not subject to

any of the restrictions in this privacy policy.

We may display an “offer wall” that is hosted by an offer wall provider. The offer wall allows third

party advertisers to provide virtual currency to users in exchange for interacting with an advertisement

or for completing a marketing offer that may include signing up for an account with one of those

advertisers. These are not offers made by us. We may display these offers to you based on certain

information, such as your geographic area or anonymous demographic information. If you click on one

of these advertisements, you will no longer be on a site hosted by Juxta or a partnering SNS.

We may provide your information to third party companies to perform services on our behalf, including

payment processing, data analysis, message delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing.

If we sell all or a portion of our business, we may transfer all of your information, including personal

information, to the successor organization.

#### **Security of Your Information**

We implement security measures we believe are reasonable to protect your information. It is

important that you protect and maintain the security of your account and you need to immediately

notify us of any unauthorized use of your account. No website, mobile application or Internet

transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data

loss, or other breaches or other type of misuse will never occur. We may post a notice via the Services

if a security breach occurs. We may also send you notice by the contact information you have

provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to

receive written notice of a data privacy or security breach. If you have reason to believe that your

personal information that we have collected or our Services’ security has been breached, please notify

us by [support@juxtalabs.com.](http://support@juxtalabs.com./)

#### **Accessing and Controlling Your Information**

If you have accounts on our Services you can access and edit the information you provided to us

through individual settings in the Services. If you want to delete your accounts and information on our

Services, please contact us directly at: [support@juxtalabs.com.](http://support@juxtalabs.com./). To manage the information we receive

about you from an SNS you will need to follow the instructions at that the SNS. Once we receive your

information from an SNS, that information is stored and used by us in accordance with this Privacy

Policy.

**Opting Out of Marketing Communications**

Similarly, you may opt-out of commercial communications by clicking on the unsubscribe link in an

email or by replying “STOP” to text messages. We will process your requests as soon as possible, but

please be aware that it may take us some time to respond to your request and, in some circumstances

regarding opt-out requests, you may receive a few more messages until your request is processed.

#### **Our Policy Toward Children**

Our Services are not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any

personal information from such children. Children under the age of 13 should not use our Services at

any time. If we learn that we have collected personally identifiable information from a child under the

age of 13 we will delete such information as quickly as possible.

#### **International Operations and Information Transfer**

We may transfer data to foreign affiliates, partners or vendors. If you are located outside of the United

States of America and choose to use our Services and share information with us, we may transfer your

data across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to the United States or other countries or

jurisdictions around the world, and process it there. If you are visiting from Canada, the European

Union, or other jurisdictions with laws governing data protection that may differ from United States

law, please note that you are transferring your personal information to the United States which does not

have the same data protection laws as your country and which may provide more limited recourse

mechanisms, including dissimilar or, at times, weaker data protection rights. With knowledge of these

risks, by providing your personal information you consent to: (1) the use of your personal information

for the uses identified above in accordance with this Privacy Policy; and (2) the transfer of your

personal information to the United States and other countries as indicated above.

#### **Third Party Apps and Websites**

Our Services may link to third-party apps and websites from companies other than Juxta that may link

to their own websites, such as offer wall providers. We are not responsible for the privacy practices,

security, or the content of such websites. If you have any questions about how these other websites use

your information, you should review their policies and contact them directly. We are not responsible for

the actions of third-party advertisers and service providers.

#### **Third Party Advertisers**

We may use advertisers, third party ad networks, and other advertising companies to serve

advertisements on the Services. Please be advised that such advertising companies may gather

information about your visit to the Services or other websites (such as through cookies, web beacons,

and other technologies) to enable such advertising companies to market products or services to you, to

monitor which ads have been served to your browser and which webpages you were viewing when such

ads were delivered. If you would like to learn more about this practice, and know your choices with

respect to it, [please visit here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

AGAIN, PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT COVER THE COLLECTION

AND USE OF INFORMATION BY SUCH THIRD PARTY SITES AND ADVERTISERS.

#### **Assignment**

In the event that all or part of our assets are sold or acquired by another party, or in the event of a

merger, you grant us the right to assign your personal information collected via the Services.

#### **Changes to Our Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to our Privacy

Policy, we will notify you and other users by posting the changes on the Juxta Labs Services or by

using the contact information you have on file with us and will indicate when such changes will become

effective. By continuing to use our Services you are agreeing to be bound by any changes or revisions

made to this Privacy Policy.

#### **California Privacy Rights &amp; How We Respond to Do-Not- Track Disclosures**

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits visitors to the Services who are California residents to

request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their

direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us at the address provided at the

bottom of this Privacy Policy.

We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you

affirmatively agree to such disclosure, typically by “opting in” to receive information from a third party

that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our Services. If you do ask us to

share your personal information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share

information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third

party (other than our service providers) on a continual basis.

At this time our Services do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms,

which may include ‘do not track’ instructions.

#### **Agreement to Arbitrate**

By visiting the Services or otherwise using the Services, you and we agree that, if there is any

controversy, claim, action or dispute arising out of or related to any transaction conducted on the

Services, or the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of the Privacy Policy or any part of them

(collectively, a &quot;Dispute&quot;), both parties shall first try in good faith to settle such Dispute by providing

written notice to the other party describing the facts and circumstances of the Dispute and allowing the

receiving party thirty (30) days in which to respond to or settle the Dispute.

Notice shall be sent:

To Juxta Labs Inc., 525 Brannan St. Suite 408, San Francisco, CA 94107,

ATTN: Legal Department, or

To you at: your contact information that we have on file.

Both you and we agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent that must be

satisfied before initiating any litigation or filing any claim against the other party.

IF ANY DISPUTE CANNOT BE RESOLVED BY THE ABOVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE, YOU AGREE

THAT THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION FOR SUCH DISPUTE WILL BE DECIDED BY BINDING

ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU

WILL NOT HAVE, AND YOU WAIVE, THE RIGHT FOR A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, AND

THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. Other rights

that you and we would have in court will not be available or will be more limited in arbitration, including

discovery and appeal rights. All such Disputes shall be determined by arbitration in the San Francisco,

CA area, exclusively submitted to JAMS (www.jamsadr.com) for binding arbitration under its rules then

in effect, before one arbitrator to be mutually agreed upon by both parties.

The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve

any dispute arising under or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of

the Privacy Policy, including any claim that all or any part of the Privacy Policy is void or voidable.
