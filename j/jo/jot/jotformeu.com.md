# Privacy Policy

**Last Update: December 16, 2015**

 **1\. User Data.** To obtain access to certain areas of our website or to receive certain services we provide, you may be required to register with us and, in connection with such registration, to provide certain Personal Data (e.g., your email address). We use such information to provide the service you requested, to monitor internally usage of our website, and to contact you from time to time about us, our website, and our products and services. In addition, if you wish to make a purchase from our website, you are required to register with us and, in connection with such registration, to provide certain Personal Data (e.g., your full name, email address, and billing information). We use such information to fulfill your order and to contact you from time to time about us, our website, and our products and services. 

**2\. Submission Data.** We respect the privacy of our users and the privacy of their client data. All user information contained within the forms you may use or build on the JotForm Site are governed by our Terms of Service. You retain all rights to your data. We will not sell, share data. We will not access your data for non-administrative reasons.

 **3\. Cookies.** JotForm uses cookies. Cookies are small pieces of information we store on the device you use to access our services so we can recognize repeat users. You can control how websites use cookies by configuring the privacy settings within your browser. If you disable cookies JotForm may not function properly. Here are the main ways we use cookies:

**(1) Authentication**. Authenticating and identifying you on our site so we can provide you the services you requested.  
 **(2) Keeping track of information you have provided to us**. For example, we’ll track the last form you modified.  
 **(3) Personalization**. We store user preferences in cookies to personalize your user experience.  
 **(4) Site Improvements**. We use cookies to measure your site usage to help us understand your needs as a user and make improvements to JotForm.  
 **(5) Analytics**. We have implemented third party tracking tools such as Google Analytics which use cookies to track usage.  


4\. **Safe Harbor for EU users**. JotForm is in compliance with what was known as the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, which was set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Here's our [official certification notice](https://safeharbor.export.gov/companyinfo.aspx?id=27141 "JotForm Safe Harbor Certified").

However, in early Oct 2015, the Safe Harbor framework was nullified by the highest court in Europe, which meant EU users no longer had a legal safeguard guiding how their data was handled by US companies. In response to this, JotForm has taken the ground breaking step of offering its EU users the opportunity to store their data exclusively in Europe. This ensures EU users can retain their data in their own jurisdiction, which follows their specific data privacy requirements. More information can be found here.
