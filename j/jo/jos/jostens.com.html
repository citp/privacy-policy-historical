            <p class="tab3"><em>Information from You</em>. We collect personal information (information that identifies you as an individual) and other information from you through your use of this Property. Examples of the type of information we collect include, but are not limited to, your name, e-mail address, age, gender, the name of the school you attend, billing and/or shipping address, phone number, payment account information, your preferences and interests, and other information about you.  We also collect information that you provide to Jostens directly, such as through your contact with our customer service representatives or sales associates, or that you provide to Jostens via Jostens independent sales representatives. </p>   
      <p class="tab3"><em>User Content.</em> If you use this Property to submit photographs, user profiles, audiovisual materials, questions, comments or other content (collectively, "<strong>User Content</strong>"), we can reproduce, publish, distribute or otherwise use submitted User Content in any media or format currently existing or later developed. Certain personal information, such as your name and email address, can be publicly displayed along with and/or associated with your User Content.  Please think carefully before deciding what information you share as User Content. Please note that we do not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure. We are not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any User Content that you provide.  If you provide us with any ideas, comments, suggestions, or other feedback related to Jostens' products, services or business, you grant us a perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide right to use it for any purpose related to our business without compensation to you. Please note that your use of Properties through which you can provide User Content is subject to our <a href="http://www.jostens.com/apps/shop/help/shared/terms.asp" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
      <p class="tab3"><em>Information You Provide About Others</em>.  If you initiate a communication to someone else through a Property such as through a "send-to-a-friend" feature, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we expressly advise otherwise. Please be aware that your name and/or email address could be included in any send-to-a-friend communication.</p>
      <p class="tab3"> <em>Information from Schools and Other Third Parties</em>.  In the course of our business and in providing our products and services, we receive personal information about individuals from our customers and partners, including schools.</p>
      <p class="tab3">We also acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information that you provided or we collected automatically, such as information to validate or update your address or other demographic and lifestyle information.</p>
      <p class="tab3"><em>Information from Social Networking and Third Party Services</em>.  Functionality on a Property can permit interactions with social networking and other third party services  ("<strong>Social Features</strong>").  Examples of Social Features include enabling you to "like" or "share" content or to log into a Property using your third party service username and password.  If you connect your Jostens account with a third party service provider, it may share information about you with us such as your public profile, e-mail address and friend list.  If you choose to "like" or share content, that information and other information about you may be publicly displayed.  You should review the privacy policy of that third party service provider and check your privacy settings through that provider.  If you post information on a social networking or third party service that references Jostens or its products or services (e.g., via a Twitter hashtag), your post may be cross-published on a Property.</p>

          <td width="565"><p class="tab3"><strong>Information Collected as You Access and Use a Property</strong>.  Like most websites and applications, we and our third party service providers and advertisers use cookies and similar technologies to make our websites and applications work, and to learn more about our users and their likely interests as well as information relating to their visits and interactions with a Property.  These technologies include cookies, flash cookies, HTML5 cookies, tracking pixels, web beacons, and embedded scripts (collectively, "<strong>Tracking Technologies</strong>"). We also collect information regarding your web browser or device, and collect geolocation information where you have allowed us or a third party advertiser or service provider to do so.</p>
          <p class="tab3"><em>Web Browser or Device Information</em>.  We and our service providers collect information sent by your web browser or device, including your IP address, and other information that does not identify you personally such as a device or browser token, the date and time of your visit, information about your web browser or device type, etc. The information received depends on the settings on your web browser or device. If you have created a user identity or profile on one of your visits to a Property, we link the information provided by your browser or device to information that identifies you personally and use it for the purposes described in this Policy. Please review the settings of your web browser or device if you want to learn and change what information is sent by your browser or device.  </p>
          <p class="tab3"><em>"Do Not Track" Headers</em>.  "Do Not Track" (DNT) is a web browser setting which lets the websites you visit know that you do not want them collecting information about you. We do not respond to DNT settings or signals.</p>
          <p class="tab3"><em>Geolocation Information</em>. We use your device's location services to determine your coarse (network-based) and fine (GPS-based) location via your device in order to provide you with customized or geographically-specific content.  For example, our ReplayIt® app uses location services to provide users with a list of schools in the user's geographic area to make it easier for users to select an affiliated school. You can control whether your device allows applications to use location services through the mobile device settings for your device.  ReplayIt users can turn off these location services within the App by selecting the option to turn off location services in the application bar or other available functionality.</p>
          <p class="tab3"><em>Cookies</em>. A cookie is a data file placed on a computer.  We use both "session cookies" and "persistent cookies" to collect information for record keeping purposes, to make it easier for you to use a Property, and to customize information that is presented to you through a Property. Session cookies are used to store information while a user accesses a Property, and expire when the user closes his/her browser "session." Persistent cookies store information across sessions (e.g., to make it easier to log into a Property) and stay on your computer until the expiration date set in the cookie (e.g., at the end of a calendar month) or until you delete it. We also use HTML5 local storage ("HTML5 cookies"), which is a newer, faster and more secure cookie technology used with the HTML5 web language.  Like traditional cookies, HTML5 local storage can be used as session storage or persistent storage.  We also use "Flash cookies," locally-stored data files used to personalize your use of a Property through Adobe Flash technologies. Flash cookies can also be used by our third party service providers to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.</p>
          <p class="tab3"><em>Web Beacons</em>. We use small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs," "clear GIFs," "single-pixel GIFs," "pixel tags," "JavaScript tags," "web bugs," and "action tags") on a Property or in our email communications to you. We use web beacons for a number of purposes, such as to track browser types, to track the search terms and domain names that bring visitors to our Property, to count visitors to a Property, to monitor how users navigate a Property, and to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or how many particular links or content elements were actually viewed.</p>
          <p class="tab3"><em>Embedded Scripts</em>. We use embedded scripts, which is programming code designed to collect information about how visitors interact with a Property, such as the referring website which linked them to a Property and the manner in which they use a Property. Embedded scripts are downloaded onto your device's cache from our web server or a third party service provider and are deactivated or deleted following the end of your session once your browser cache is cleared.</p>

<p class="tab4"><em>To Provide, Manage and Improve our Properties, Products, Services and Our Business and to Deliver Content</em>.  We use information that we collect and obtain to provide our goods and services, to administer a Property, and for other lawful business purposes. These include the manufacture and printing of products, such as yearbooks, announcements, memory books and jewelry which can contain personal information such as names and photos.  We also use the information that we collect and obtain about you to measure and improve our Properties, products and services; to help up maintain the accuracy of information in our systems; to customize certain features of a Property, to deliver relevant content and to provide you with an enhanced experience based on the type of device you are using.

<p class="tab4">To the extent permitted by law, we may use third party advertising service providers, including networks, data exchanges, ad servers, analytics providers and others to serve ads regarding our products and services.  These third party service providers utilize Tracking Technologies to collect certain information about your visits to our Property and third party websites, your interaction with our Property or those websites, and the products and services offered by us, our partners, and others.  We and our partners use this information, as well as information received from other sources, for marketing analysis, for quality improvement purposes, and to provide you with customized content and offers.   We do not control Tracking Technologies used by third parties, and their use is governed by their own privacy policies. For more information on online advertising, please visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info</a>.

<p class="tab4"><em>With Certain Partners.</em> We may give you the opportunity to receive marketing and promotional offers and/or other content from certain of our partners (collectively, "<strong>Partner Offers</strong>").

Our partner's use of your information is governed by that partner's privacy policy.</p>
<p class="tab4"><em>For Us and Our Service Providers to Provide Services and Deliver Content</em>.

We provide our service providers access to information, including personal information, only for the purpose of carrying out services on our behalf.  Certain service providers use Tracking Technologies to collect and store information about you and your use of a Property, and combine this information with information they collect from other sources.  If you access a Property through a mobile device or application, certain of your information is sharted with the mobile carrier or application provider. Information provided through a portion of a Property that is hosted by a Jostens service provider may be stored on our systems, and/or the systems, of our service provider, and will be provided to Jostens and/or processed by that service provider for Jostens' business purposes. </p>
<p class="tab4"><em>To Comply with Legal Requirements and Protect You, Jostens and Others</em>. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may disclose information when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law or a regulatory requirement; to comply with governmental, administrative or judicial process, requirement or order, such as a subpoena or court order; to cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental investigations (without necessarily requiring the law enforcement or government agency requesting the information to formally serve us with a subpoena); to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to enforce a contract; to protect the legal rights, property, or safety of Jostens, its corporate affiliates, and their respective employees, clients, partners and agents, other users or the public in general; or to protect your vital interests if determined necessary by us. In addition, we review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network. If we suspect criminal activity, we share our server logs – which contain visitors' IP addresses – with the appropriate investigative authorities who use that information to trace and identify individuals. We also reserve the right to report to appropriate law enforcement or government agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe are in violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations without providing notice.</p>
<p class="tab4"><em>In Connection with Corporate Events</em>. If one of our corporate affiliates or a third party has acquired all or part of our business, specific assets or the business of one of our operating divisions through which you have provided information to us, e.g., as the result of a sale, merger, reorganization, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation, ownership of your personal information will transfer to that company. In that event, the acquiring company's use of your personal information will still be governed by this Policy and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
