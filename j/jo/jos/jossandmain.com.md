This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") is designed to help you understand how Wayfair LLC and its affiliated brands, including Wayfair.com, Joss & Main, DwellStudio, AllModern and Wayfair Supply ("Joss and Main", "Wayfair", "we" or "us" ) collects and processes the information that you share when you use this and any of our websites (together, the "Site") and our mobile application (the "App," and together with the Site, the "Service"). 

Before submitting information to the Service, please review this Privacy Policy carefully. By using or accessing the Service, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you prefer that we not collect and process information about you, please do not provide it to us and do not access the Service. 

We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under 13. Where any such information is inadvertently collected, we will delete the information as soon as possible. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us. 

Information We Collect 

We collect the information that you share with us, including: 

  * Personal Information: "Personal Information" is information that can personally identify you, such as your name, email address and telephone number. We maintain one or more databases to store your Personal Information and may retain it as reasonably required to serve you and operate the Service. Personal Information that we collect depends on how you use the Service. Providing your Personal Information to us is your choice. If you choose not to provide us with certain Personal Information, you may not be able to take advantage of certain features of the Service; and 
  * General Information: When you visit the Service, we may collect various categories of general non-personal information ("General Information"). General Information includes browser information, operating system information, device information, TCP-IP address and the date, time, length of stay and specific pages accessed during your visits to the Service. 



Registering for the Service 

If you register to use the Service, we may collect Personal Information including your name, email address, and telephone number. 

You may also register for the Service using another service, such as Facebook. If you create your Wayfair account by connecting through another service, you are authorizing us to use public information from that connected account to help complete your Wayfair profile. Please remember that the manner in which the service uses, stores, and discloses your information is governed solely by the policies of such service. We recommend that you review the terms and policies of that service, including its privacy and data gathering practices. Wayfair shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any third party service provider or any other third-party site or service that may be enabled within the Service. 

You may review, update, or modify your account information, including profile and contact information, at any time by logging into your Wayfair account. You may also permanently delete your account by contacting us. 

Online Identification Tools 

Like many website providers, we use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and provide a better web experience. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and gather General Information. 

We use web beacons (a.k.a. clear GIFs, web bugs or pixel tags) to personalize your experience of the Service and to generate information about Service traffic and trends. Web beacons collect General Information, such as the type of browser that you use and your IP address. Web beacons may be used alone or in conjunction with cookies; when web beacons are used with cookies, they may link General Information to Personal Information. Web beacons usually are not visible to you. 

We also use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and for other purposes like personalizing the Service. A cookie is a small file stored by your internet browser on your computer. A "session cookie" stores temporary information that is erased when you close your web browser or turn off your computer. A "persistent cookie" enables the Service to recognize you when you return to it and remains stored on your computer until you delete it. Your web browser is usually set up to initially accept cookies. If you set your browser to reject cookies, the Service will not be able to recognize your account or to personalize the content that you see. A "flash cookie," also known as a "local storage object," is not stored in your browser, unlike other cookies, and instead placed on your computer by websites that use Adobe Flash. You may disable flash cookies via your Flash Player preferences or by using third-party software. We do not and cannot use cookies to gather other information that may be stored on your hard drive. 

Third-party advertisers also help us display tailored content to our customers and serve advertising on our behalf. These advertisers may also utilize cookies and/or web beacons to collect General Information about your activities on the Service, to target advertising based upon your interests and to measure effectiveness of the Service. Our systems do not currently recognize browser "Do Not Track" signals, but if you wish to not have General Information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may be able to opt-out by visiting http://www.youradchoices.com or similar online resources about behavioral advertising. Please note that opting out prevents targeted advertising but does not prevent all advertising. 

Third Party Features 

The Service also may include an activity feed, social media buttons and widgets, such as the Facebook "Like" button or the "Share This" button. These features may collect and display your Personal Information, your IP address and the page you are visiting on the Service and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. These features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Service and your interactions with them are governed by the privacy policy of the third party that provides the feature. 

Use of Service via Mobile Device 

If you use the Service through your mobile device, we may collect your geo-location information to assist us in fulfilling your order. We will not share this information with third parties and will only use this information for the sole purpose of fulfilling your order. You may at any time prevent the Service from using your location by turning this option off at the device level. 

When you use the Service through your mobile device, we also collect device type and UUID, a unique identifier generated within the App, and store this information in log files. We use this information to provide you with the most up to date application and features, or to advertise or promote products or services to you that are applicable to your device type. 

Third-Party Links 

We may provide links to third-party websites that we do not own or control. We are not responsible for the information collection practices of any website that we do not own or control. We encourage you to review and understand the privacy practices of third-party websites before providing any information to or through them. 

How Your Personal Information is Used, Processed and Disclosed 

Except as specified in this Privacy Policy, Wayfair does not rent, sell, trade or disclose your Personal Information to third parties without your prior consent. Wayfair may, however, use, process and disclose Personal Information to: 

  * send information to customers about orders;
  * fulfill your orders;
  * process and collect your payments;
  * administer "Wayfair Rewards" and other customer loyalty programs;
  * send you promotional marketing material about Wayfair’s company and partners;
  * produce content for our activity feed feature;
  * customize, analyze, adjust and improve the Service to better meet your needs;
  * execute a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion;
  * enforce Wayfair’s agreements with you;
  * provide you with important administrative information regarding the Service, such as changes to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, rewards and loyalty programs and other policies;
  * prevent fraud and other prohibited or illegal activities; and
  * comply with potential requests of law enforcement or data protection agencies.



When possible, General Information may be combined and/or linked to Personal Information, in accordance with the purposes specified above. 

We may use your General Information and deidentified Personal Information to prepare anonymized, aggregated data about our users ("Anonymized Data"). We may provide third parties with Anonymized Data in describing the Service to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties, and for all other lawful purposes. As communicated to third parties, the Anonymized Data does not include any information permitting the recipient to identify, locate or contact you. 

Third Party Service Providers 

Wayfair employs other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, serving ads on our behalf, providing search results and links, and processing credit card payments. These third-party service providers have access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions but may not use it for any other purpose. 

Acquisition of Wayfair 

Information about customers is considered an asset of Wayfair and, as such, may be transferred to another company as part of a merger or acquisition. 

Information Sharing for Marketing Purposes 

To provide you with information about products and services that may be useful to you, we may partner with select reputable organizations whose privacy policies we believe are consistent with ours. Such organizations may include other retailers and magazine publishers. Through these arrangements, we may share, exchange, cross-reference and/or rent your name and mailing address. 

If you do not want us to share your Personal Information with third parties for marketing purposes, please contact us. Immediately after your request has been processed, your information will no longer be shared with any third party for marketing purposes. 

Blogs, Reviews and Forums 

The Service also may from time to time offer publicly-accessible blogs, customer reviews or forums. Any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected and used by others who access them. To request removal of your Personal Information from blogs, customer reviews or forums, please contact us. Please note that in some cases we may be unable to remove your Personal Information. 

Inviting Others 

You may choose to invite someone else to use the Service by providing his or her name and email address. We may use this information to send invitations to such individuals, to track the results of such invitation referrals, and to confirm qualifying orders attributable to your registered account. Anyone who receives an email invitation to use the Service may opt out of receiving such emails in the future by following the opt-out instructions in the email. We take commercially reasonable steps to implement all opt-out requests promptly, but those who opt out may still receive communications from us as we process the opt-out request, or as required for order processing and other purposes. 

Retention of Personal Information 

Wayfair retains Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by applicable law. 

Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information and Preferences 

Modifying or Deleting Your Personal Information 

If you would like to modify or delete your Personal Information, please contact us with clear instructions about what you would like to be modified or deleted. We will respond to your request promptly. 

Changing Your Subscription Preferences 

If you tell us that you do not want us to use your Personal Information to contact you, Wayfair will respect your wishes. If you are a registered user, you may change your preferences to receive or not to receive email or other communications from us by logging in to your account and indicating those preferences on the "My Account" section of our Service. 

You may also instruct Wayfair to stop sending you emails, newsletters or other information by following the ‘unsubscribe’ instructions provided in the email. Wayfair may, however, continue to use your Personal Information to contact you to service your account or as otherwise authorized by law. Please note that if you use more than one name or e-mail address when communicating with Wayfair or using the Service, you may continue to receive communications from Wayfair to any name and/or email address not specified in your opt-out request. 

Information for Visitors From California and Outside of the United States 

California Residents 

California law permits individuals who provide Wayfair with Personal Information and who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To request this information, please contact us. 

Visitors from Outside of the United States 

The Service is hosted in the United States. If you are visiting the Service from outside the United States, your information may be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable US laws. Please note that data protection and other applicable laws of the United States may not be as comprehensive as those laws or regulations in your country or may otherwise differ from the data protection or consumer protection laws in your country. By using the Service, you consent to transfer of your information to our facilities as described in this Privacy Policy. 

Information Security 

We have instituted reasonable safeguards to help ensure that information collected is secure. We also take reasonable steps to ensure that third parties who work with us to make the Site (including the software, applications and services provided on the Site) available to you agree to protect personal information that they must access in order to serve you and to honor your preferences about contacts you receive. 

When you send or otherwise transmit your sensitive information (such as your credit card number) to or though the Sites, your sensitive information is encrypted and protected with SSL, the current industry-standard encryption protocol. When you are on an SSL-protected page, a picture of a closed lock appears at the bottom or top of some web browsers. Another way to tell if you are on a secure page is to check the URL or address of the page. (Look in the address box or right-click on the page and select "Properties".) These secure SSL-encrypted pages have URLs that start with "https://" instead of "http://". 

Please understand, however, that it is possible for third parties to access information despite our efforts. Without limiting the terms of our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, you understand that we do not guarantee that your use of the Site and/or information provided by you will be private or secure and we are not responsible or liable to you for any lack of privacy or security you may experience. You are fully responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the Site. You also understand that any information provided by you or collected by us or our agents in connection with your use of the Site will be used in the manner described in our Terms of Use. Please do not use the Site if you do not agree to the terms and conditions described in this Information Security section. 

If you have any questions about security of the Site, please contact us. 

Changes to our Privacy Policy 

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices. When we post modifications to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this web page. The modified Privacy Policy will be effective immediately upon posting on the Service. Your continued use of the Service after the posting of the modified Privacy Policy constitutes your agreement to abide and be bound by it. If we make any material change, we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Service prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. If you object to any modification, your sole recourse is to stop using the Service.
