# Privacy Policy | Workout songs and playlists - jog.fm

_Last Updated: August 16, 2011_

## A message from the jog.fm team

We're people just like you. We care about our privacy, we hate pop-up and pop-under ads, **we despise spam** , we dislike obligatory registrations, and we really don't like insecure websites. We spent a lot of time making sure our site was secure, and as private as you'd like it to be. We have, and will continue to reject distasteful, or otherwise "sketchy" ads. We'll never spam, or distribute your email address to anyone. **And more importantly, we've built the site so you can use most of the functionality without an account.**

If you have any questions or concerns about the privacy of this site, please [contact us](mailto:hello@jog.fm). We're willing to go well out of our way to make sure you have a safe, enjoyable experience on our site.

Your privacy and security are some of our top concerns. Accordingly, we have developed this Privacy Policy (the "Policy") in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of personal information. The following outlines the Policy. 

##  1\. Audience 

**Children under the age of 13 are not eligible to use our Properties** and must not attempt to register with the Properties and/or submit any personal information. We do not knowingly collect personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register.

We may be provided with confirmation of your transactions with such third parties and, in some instances, such confirmation may include your personal information. Aside from such confirmations, the only information that we will collect with respect to such third party links is: (a) the number of Users who utilized such links; and (b) the number of purchases made by these Users.
