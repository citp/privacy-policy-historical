### AFFILIATES, SERVICE PROVIDERS & THIRD PARTIES

We may share information about you with affiliated companies for the purposes described in this policy.  For example, we may share your history of purchases effected through the American Joe Fresh website with Loblaws Inc., who has the rights to operate the Canadian Joe Fresh business and website, in order to enhance your shopping experience.

We may also share your information with service providers who may assist us in responding to your inquires or requests or otherwise serve you, fulfill your requests for products, or for the purpose(s) authorized when it was submitted. For example, if you voluntarily submit personal information to enter a sweepstakes in one of our stores or on the Web Site, the information that you submit may be used as part of your entry to that sweepstakes. These service providers are required to treat this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. 

When you visit our Site other parties may collect information about your online activities on the Site and elsewhere over time for the purpose of making inferences about your interests to enhance your online experience and to deliver more relevant advertising to you, or to offer you their products or services.  To learn about entities that engage in these types of practices that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Program, please visit www.aboutads.info.

### HOW YOU CAN CONTROL DATA ABOUT YOU

You may choose at any time to remove any of your personal information from any lists we might use to send you marketing communications by contacting us using the contact information provided below. 

### EMAIL

You can subscribe to receive coupons, promotions, and other product offers (“Promotion Emails”) from us by email by visiting joefresh.com and clicking on ‘subscribe’ within the bottom navigation. If you no longer wish to receive emails from us, you can unsubscribe through a link provided in a Promotion Email from us or contacting us through the means described in the Contact Us section. 

You may still receive emails from us if you elect to unsubscribe, but you will no longer receive Promotion Emails. For example, if you provide your email in order to participate in an optional feature or function of the Website such as a sweepstakes, contest or online offer, even if you opt to unsubscribe from Promotion Emails or change your preferences not to receive any marketing communications, you may still receive emails about the specific sweepstakes, contest or online offer you entered until the sweepstakes, contest or online offer has expired, but you will not receive other emails if you opt to “Unsubscribe”.

If you elect to share content with your friends through tools or features provided through the Web site, you may be required to provide your friends’ email addresses. We will only use this information to send your message and will not retain the information for our own use. 

**NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT**

When you visit the Web Site, you do not have to provide us with any personal information. However, certain non-identifying information may be automatically collected. We do not consider this information to be personal information. For example, our web server may collect the internet protocol (“IP”) address and the name of the Internet Service Provider (“ISP”) associated with the computer or mobile device from which you accessed the Web Site, the type and version of web browser and operating system that you are using, and the address of the web site that you visited prior to visiting the Web Site. 

We use this information to better understand how visitors interact with the Web Site so that we can improve your experience when you visit this site. We may use this information to better design our Website and enhance your in-store and online shopping experience. For example, we may track your location in order to provide you with location-specific offers and promotions.

 **COOKIES**

We may use cookies or other similar technology to enhance your online experience. A “cookie” is a small piece of information that our web server automatically sends to your browser that permits our web server to recall information about your settings and preferences (such as the settings of your web browser and language preference). Please note that portions of the Web Site may not function if you do not accept cookies.

 **SECURITY & RETENTION**

We use reasonable security measures to help protect personal information against loss or theft and against unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.

Personal information will be retained only as long as necessary to fulfill a legitimate business need or as required by law. 

**INDIVIDUAL ACCESS**

To update or correct information you have given  us, you can contact us using the contact information provided below to correct or update your contact information.

We may need to verify your identity before providing you with the personal information we hold about you. 

We may not be able to provide you with access to your personal information where the information cannot be disclosed for reasons of security or commercial confidentiality, where the information is protected by legal privilege or when access is prohibited by law. 

**A NOTE ABOUT PRIZE PROMOTIONS**

Promotions (such as contests, sweepstakes or giveaways) that are hosted on the Web Site may be sponsored by JFS, may be co-sponsored by JFS and another company, or may be sponsored by companies other than JFS. JFS may also sponsor or co-sponsor promotions hosted by third parties on linked third party web sites. When you enter a promotion hosted or sponsored by JFS and/or our partners, you may be asked to provide registration information, which may include your name, address, and email address, and other information, some of which may be optional, in order to participate. If you voluntarily submit personally identifying information to enter a sweepstakes on the Website, the information that your submit may be used as part of your entry, for sweepstakes administration and prize fulfillment purposes, and/or for future marketing by Sponsor, such as to notify you of a product or promotion that Sponsor thinks may be of interest. 

Third parties that host promotions alone or in conjunction with JFS may collect and use your information. Some promotion sites may use Cookies in order to track your progress or number of entries in a promotion. If information is collected and used by a third party in conjunction with a promotion, please review the third party’s Privacy Policy to learn about its information practices.

When you participate in a promotion, you are subject to the Official Rules of that promotion, which may contain additional information about the specific privacy practices associated with that promotion.

 **THIRD-PARTY LINKS**

For your convenience, the Web Site may contain links to other web sites operated by third parties. Any such web sites are wholly independent from our Web Site and we have no control over those web sites and their operators, including their privacy policies and practices. Before providing any of your personal information on any such other web site, you should review their policies on privacy and security.

 **BUSINESS CHANGES**

In the event that JFS experiences a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be among the information transferred.

 **UPDATES**

JFS may modify this Privacy Policy at any time. We encourage you to periodically check back to this privacy policy to learn about updates to our data practices.
