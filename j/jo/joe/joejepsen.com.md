# Privacy Policy

Jepsen Web Design, Marketing and Merchandise (“ **Jepsen Emporium** “) operates JoeJepsen.com and may operate other websites. It is Jepsen Emporium’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Jepsen Emporium collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Jepsen Emporium’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Jepsen Emporium’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Jepsen Emporium may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Jepsen Emporium also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on JoeJepsen.com blogs/sites. Jepsen Emporium only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Jepsen Emporium’s websites choose to interact with Jepsen Emporium in ways that require Jepsen Emporium to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Jepsen Emporium gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at JoeJepsen.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Jepsen Emporium are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Jepsen Emporium collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Jepsen Emporium. Jepsen Emporium does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

Jepsen Emporium may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Jepsen Emporium may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Jepsen Emporium does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Jepsen Emporium discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Jepsen Emporium’s behalf or to provide services available at Jepsen Emporium’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Jepsen Emporium’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Jepsen Emporium will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Jepsen Emporium discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Jepsen Emporium believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Jepsen Emporium, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Jepsen Emporium website and have supplied your email address, Jepsen Emporium may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Jepsen Emporium and our products. If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Jepsen Emporium takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
