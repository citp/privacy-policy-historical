  * [www.joesnewbalanceoutlet.com](http://www.joesnewbalanceoutlet.com/) (the "Website"); 
  * all mobile applications (each, an "App") that contain a link to this Privacy Policy; and
  * all services made available by Joe's New Balance Outlet through the Website and the Apps.



For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, the foregoing are referred to, collectively, as the "Service". 

This Privacy Policy applies whether you are a "Visitor" (which means that you simply browse the Service) or you are a "Member" (which means that you have registered or transacted with the Service or a component thereof). By accessing or using the Service and providing us with information through the Service, you consent to this Privacy Policy. We suggest that you review this Privacy Policy periodically as we will update and change it from time to time. 

## WHAT INFORMATION DOES JOE'S NEW BALANCE OUTLET COLLECT ABOUT ME?

**Non-Individually Identifiable Data:**  
As is the case with most online services, every time you visit our Website or use one of our Apps, we automatically collect certain data and information from you and/or your computer that is not personally identifiable. Examples of this type of information include:

  * The Web page from which you came. 
  * The pages and features you visit and access on our Service.



When you access, visit and/or use our Website or one or more of our Apps, we may track your visit and, as described below in the section concerning "cookies", collect certain data regarding your use of the Service and your activity on the Service, but we will not collect any Personal Information from you unless you choose to provide it to us.

We use third party analytics tools, including those offered by Google, Inc. ("Google"). These third party services use cookies to help us analyze how users use our Website and our Apps.

Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our Website and our Apps, compiling reports on activity for website and application operators and providing other services relating to online activity and Internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on behalf of Google. To opt-out of Google analytics, please see: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.  Joe's New Balance Outlet may collect your geolocation data through the Services for purposes of offering relevant content and services. Geolocation data consists of general location information based on latitude and longitude (if you have enabled location services for a Joe's New Balance Outlet application on your mobile device), or Joe's New Balance Outlet may approximate your location based on the IP address of your computer or mobile device.

**Personal Information:**  
In general, you can visit our Service without providing us with any personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number, gender, credit card information or other information necessary to process your order (all such personally identifiable information, collectively, "Personal Information"). However, in order to place an order, register for or use certain services and features made available through our Service, you will be required to provide certain Personal Information. 

When you make a purchase from Joe's New Balance Outlet, request to sign up for email, direct mail or SMS Text notices, we collect Personal Information that you elect to provide to us. Your submission of this Personal Information is entirely voluntary; however, if you elect not to provide this Personal Information, some of the services and/or features available on and/or through the Service may not be available for your use.

We also collect Personal Information when you register for "My Account", participate in a contest, event or sweepstakes promotion, fill out a survey or contact us (for example via email) or by selecting "Ask the Expert" from the Service. We may also obtain data through your Internet browser, such as your IP Address, which is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.

If you elect to register for "My Account", you will have the option to store your credit card information with our Service. This feature, which is entirely optional, is provided as a convenience for you so that you will not need to re-enter your full credit card information each time you make a purchase through the Service. If you elect to take advantage of this feature, please be aware that, as a security precaution, we will not store your CCV number. You will be required to input this information prior to placing an order. If you elect to store your credit card number in the "My Account" feature, you will have the ability to change your mind and remove your credit card number from storage at any time by logging into "My Account" and making the appropriate change.

While Joe's New Balance Outlet's policy prohibits children under 13 from registering with the Service, parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment.
