### Here's Why We Place A Cookie On Your Hard Drive

Lakewood.cc uses a feature of your Internet Web browser that is called a "cookie." A "cookie" is a file that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive. When you initially log on to Lakewood.cc, we create a "cookie" for your computer and then use it to track your clicks as you go through the Web site. Approximately 95% of eCommerce websites use "cookies" to help make their shopping cart work. Lakewood.ccuses cookies:

  2. To tell us whether you've visited Lakewood.cc previously.
  3. To help determine whether you came to Lakewood.cc from a particular Internet link or banner advertisement.

Cookies cannot be used by Lakewood.cc to retrieve any personal information about you unless you have previously purchased from or registered with Lakewood.cc.

The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
