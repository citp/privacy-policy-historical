 Joe's not in the biz of handing out your personal info willy-nilly. Personally identifiable information about you will be made available to the Website owner and your personally identifiable information will be provided to other companies or people only:

> if you have given your consent to share the information;

> if your information is to be shared to provide the service or information you have requested;

> to respond to any legal process(es);

Also, users who create an account on the Website may receive a welcome email containing valuable account info, and service announcements, including important messages concerning any temporary site or system outages, plus any maintenance issues that may affect the level of service. In order to provide the info or services you have requested, your identifiable information may be transferred or stored on computer equipment or in offices that are located outside your area, and you are deemed to consent to that.

**SECURITY AND PRIVACY**

We use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of your personally identifiable information. However, any transmission of info over the internet cannot be made completely secure. Accordingly, we assume no responsibility or liability for disclosure of any of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorised third-party access or other causes beyond our reasonable control.

You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any account ID or password you use to register, and you should always be careful and responsible whenever disclosing info online.

The Website may contain links to other websites that are owned and operated by third parties. The information practices of those other websites are not covered by this Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of other websites. We strongly suggest that you review any third party's privacy policy before providing information to them. You should contact these third parties directly with questions about their use of the information that they collect.

**OPTING IN, OPTING OUT**

By opting to receive emails from the Website, you are opting to receive by electronic mail info and/or offers on any new promos, events, products or materials from our clients for whom we manage this Policy.

If at any time you indicate that you no longer want to receive such email communications, or if you want to change or correct any previously provided information we maintain, you may send such direction to our Customer Support Team.

**CORRECTIONS AND UPDATES**

Prior to the modification of your personally identifiable info as a security precaution, we may ask to confirm your identity by providing identifying information such as your name, address and/or birth date, government-issued ID or any other documentation we deem necessary. In addition, access to personally identifiable info may be limited or denied where providing such access would be unreasonably burdensome or expensive in the circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by law.
