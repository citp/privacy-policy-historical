                      <li>JSP  does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when   you interact with or view a targeted ad.

                      <li>JSP  advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks,   insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial   companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies). </li>
