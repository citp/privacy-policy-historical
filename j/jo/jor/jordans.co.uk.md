**Cookies**  
Cookies are small files which some websites transfer onto the hard drive of your computer. Cookies store information so that you are recognised the next time that you visit the site or to process your order. You can set your web browser to prevent it from automatically accepting cookies or to notify you before a cookie is accepted.

This site uses cookies only for the duration of your session to store information relevant to any order you may place with us. If you have disabled cookies you may need to adjust the privacy settings on your internet browser to use this site. Further information on this can usually be found in the help menu of your internet browser.

Generally, website operators must obtain your consent to use cookies. However, one of the categories of cookies that we use are those which are ‘strictly necessary' to enable us to provide you with any service which you have requested from us that is to be delivered online. We do not need to ask for your consent to use these cookies, as we would not be able to provide the service you had asked for without them.

The other category of cookie that we use is Google Analytics which sets cookies to help us accurately estimate the number of visitors to our website and volumes of usage. This information helps us to improve our services and website. The data stored by these cookies can only be seen by Google's and our relevant teams and never shows any confidential information.

**Accessing personal data**  
You have the right, by written request and on payment of a small fee, to a copy of any personal data (as defined in the Data Protection Act 1998) which we hold about you.
