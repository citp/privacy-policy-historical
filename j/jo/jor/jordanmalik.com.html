<h2 id="pri-top" class="section-start">LinkedIn Privacy Policy</h2>

<h3>Introduction:</h3>

<p>
  The mission of LinkedIn is to connect the world’s professionals to enable them to be more productive and successful. We work to fulfill this mission by helping you, your connections, and millions of other professionals meet, exchange ideas, learn, make deals, find opportunities or employees, work, and make decisions in a network of trusted relationships and groups.
</p>
<p>
  Being part of LinkedIn means sharing information about yourself with other professionals, communicating with them, as well as working privately on your own. By default, your account is set up to share the information that we have found the vast majority of our Users are interested in sharing.  But the amount and type of information you decide to share, and with whom you share it, is up to you.
</p>
<p>
  Here are the three main types of information on LinkedIn:
</p>
<p>
  <em>Information about yourself that you share.</em>  This is the information that your connections, other professionals, and companies see about you. This includes your profile and your contributions to discussions on LinkedIn Groups, Answers, or other community features LinkedIn may offer.  <strong>You have control over what you share</strong>, and <strong>you can update information at any time</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Communication.</em>  We help you communicate with connections and other professionals.  Some of this is one-to-one, some of it is in groups, and some of it is public discussion.  <strong>You decide how much or how little you wish to communicate to individuals or groups.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Private activity.</em> We also provide tools that you can use privately on LinkedIn (for example, searching, or adding notes to your connections information.) <strong>These actions and information are private and we don't share or distribute them to others on the website.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Of course, maintaining your trust is our top concern, so we adhere to the following principles to protect your privacy:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>We do not rent, sell, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes.</li>
  <li>We do not share any information you have not chosen to display on your LinkedIn profile to other parties, unless compelled by law, or as necessary to enforce our User Agreement or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of LinkedIn, its Users, and the public.</li>
  <li>All information that you provide will be protected with industry standard protocols and technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page. By continuing to use the LinkedIn service after notice of changes has been sent to you or published on the LinkedIn website, you are consenting to the changes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Please read this policy</strong> and send us questions, concerns and suggestions at <a href="mailto:privacy@linkedin.com">privacy@linkedin.com</a>.
</p>

<h3>What LinkedIn’s Privacy Policy Covers:</h3>
<ol class="doc-outline-summary" style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <li>Information collected by LinkedIn.</li>
  <li>How LinkedIn uses your information.</li>
  <li>Your information choices.</li>
  <li>Your obligations as a User.</li>
  <li>Important information regarding service eligibility and US Department of Commerce Safe Harbor certification.</li>

<ol class="pri" style="list-style-type: alpha">
  
  <li>
    <h3 id="pri-1">Personal Information Collected</h3>
    <p>
      The mission of LinkedIn is to connect the world’s professionals to enable them to be more productive and successful.  To achieve this mission, LinkedIn makes services available through our website, mobile applications, and developer platform, to enable professionals to develop, maintain and enhance a network of contacts, seek experts and consultants, fill job opportunities, create, share, and distribute information in collaboration with one another (“Services”). By joining LinkedIn, you voluntarily and willingly provide us certain information, including personally identifiable information, which we collect in order to provide the Services. If you have any hesitation about providing information to us and/or having your information displayed on the LinkedIn website or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, you should not become a member of the LinkedIn community; and, if you are already a member, you should close your account.
    </p>
    <p>
      We collect your personal information in the following ways:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
      <li>
        <h4>Registration</h4>
        <p>
          In order to become a User, you must provide us the following information to create an account: name, email address, country, and password. Like other passwords, you should choose one that is known only by you. You acknowledge that this information is personal to you, and by creating an account on LinkedIn, you allow others, including LinkedIn, to identify you. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Profile Information</h4>
        <p>
          Once you become a User, you may provide additional information in the <a href="/profile" rel="external">Profile section</a> describing your skills, professional experiences, educational background, recommendations from other LinkedIn Users, group memberships, and networking objectives. Providing additional information about yourself beyond what is minimally required at registration is entirely up to you, but providing additional information enables you to derive more benefit from LinkedIn and your professional network by helping you build and leverage your professional network and facilitating your search for professional resources, information, and new opportunities. Any information you provide at registration or in the Profile section may be used by LinkedIn as described in the User Agreement and this Privacy Policy, including for the purpose of serving advertisements through the service. If you decide not to share certain information, you may not receive the full benefit of being a LinkedIn User.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Contacts Information</h4>
        <p>
          In order to connect with others on LinkedIn, you may use the Services to send invitations either to their LinkedIn profiles or email addresses if they are not Users.  The names and email addresses of people whom you invite will be used to send your invitations and reminders as well as to allow LinkedIn to help expand your network.  Please note that when you send an invitation to connect to another User, that User will have access to your email address because it is displayed in the invitation. Your connections will also have access to your email address. You may not invite anyone you do not know and trust to connect with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may also choose to manually enter or upload data about your contacts to the “Contacts” section of your account on LinkedIn. Information entered into Contacts is only viewable by you.  By providing email addresses or other information of non-Users to LinkedIn, you represent that you have authority to do so. All information that you enter or upload about your contacts will be covered by the User Agreement and this Privacy Policy and will enable us to provide customized services such as suggesting people to connect with on LinkedIn.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Customer Service</h4>
        <p>
          We may collect information through the LinkedIn website or through our <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Flinkedin%2Ecusthelp%2Ecom%2F&amp;urlhash=phDz" target="_blank" title="New window will open">customer service website</a> in order to, among other things, accurately categorize and respond to customer inquiries and investigate breaches of our terms.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Site Usage</h4>
        <p>
          We may collect information about the fact that you use certain features and functionality of LinkedIn, interact with third party Platform Applications like InApps, click on ads, or participate in research initiatives like polling and surveys on LinkedIn.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        <p>
          Like most websites, we use cookies and web log files to track site usage and trends, to improve the quality of our service, to customize your experience on LinkedIn, as well as to deliver third-party advertising to Users both on and off the LinkedIn site. A cookie is a tiny data file that resides on your computer, mobile phone, or other device, and allows us to recognize you as a User when you return to the LinkedIn website using the same computer and web browser. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use LinkedIn. One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once you’ve logged in to your LinkedIn account. The next time you visit the LinkedIn website, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing User so you will not need to log in before using the Services.  In order to access or change any of your private information (like a credit card number) or to send a message to another User, however, you must log in securely again with your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie.  Another type of cookie, called a “session” cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the LinkedIn website. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.  
        </p>
        <p>
          In the course of serving advertisements or optimizing the Services to our Users, we may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Any information provided to third parties through cookies will not be personally identifiable but may provide general segment information (e.g., your industry or geography, career field, or information about your professional or educational background) for greater customization of your user experience. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. LinkedIn does not store unencrypted personally identifiable information in the cookies.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Advertising and Web Beacons</h4>
        <p>
          To support the Services we provide at no cost to our Users, as well as provide a more relevant and useful experience for our Users, we serve our own ads and also allow third party advertisements on the site. These advertisements are targeted and served to Users, by both LinkedIn and other companies, called ad networks.  Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Advertisements on LinkedIn may be targeted to Users who fit a certain general profile category (e.g., “product managers in Texas”) or may be based on anonymized information inferred from a User’s profile (e.g., industry, compensation bracket, gender, age, ethnic origin, nationality, religion, or other aspects of your life) in addition to a User’s use of the LinkedIn site. LinkedIn does not provide personally identifiable information to any third party ad network.
        </p>
        <p>
          To increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may include a file, called a web beacon, from an ad network within pages served by LinkedIn.  The web beacon allows the ad network to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers. Web beacons also enable the ad networks to serve ads to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.

To opt-out, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/secure/settings?lan=" rel="external">click here</a> to go to the “Partner Advertising” section and change the setting to “No”.

        <h4>Log files, IP addresses and information about your computer and mobile device</h4>
        <p>
          Due to the communications standards on the internet, when you visit the LinkedIn website we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave LinkedIn. LinkedIn also receives the internet protocol (“IP”) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, email patterns, mobile device operating system (if you are accessing LinkedIn using a mobile device), as well as the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier. We use this information to analyze overall trends to help improve the service. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties without your permission, except as described in Section 2.K (“Compliance with Legal Process”), below.

        <h4>Linked Accounts</h4>
        <p>
          If you link your LinkedIn account to another account or service, or use other, third-party sites or services in conjunction with your LinkedIn account, we may collect information related to your use of third party sites and services accessed through LinkedIn or when you access LinkedIn through a third-party site or service.

        <h4>Rights to Access, Correct and Eliminate Information About You</h4>
        <p>
          You have a right to access, modify, correct and eliminate the data you supplied to LinkedIn. If you update any of your information, we may keep a copy of the information that you originally provided to us in our archives for uses documented in this policy.  You may request deletion of your information at any time by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Flinkedin%2Ecusthelp%2Ecom%2Fcgi-bin%2Flinkedin%2Ecfg%2Fphp%2Fenduser%2Fask%2Ephp%3Fp_subject%3DCorrect%2Bor%2BEliminate%2BInformation%2BAbout%2BMe&amp;urlhash=land" target="_blank" title="New window will open">contacting LinkedIn customer service</a>.

      <li>
        <h4>Consent to LinkedIn Processing Information About You</h4>
        <p>
          The information you provide to LinkedIn may reveal, or allow others to identify, your nationality, ethnic origin, religion, gender, age, geography, or other aspects of your private life. By providing information to us for the purposes of creating your User account or adding any additional details to your LinkedIn profile, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and LinkedIn’s User Agreement that allow LinkedIn to process information about you. Supplying information to LinkedIn, including any information deemed “sensitive” by applicable law, is entirely voluntary on your part. You have the right to withdraw your consent to LinkedIn’s collection and processing of your information at any time, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, by changing your <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/secure/settings" rel="external">Settings</a>, or by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/secure/settings?closemyaccountstart=" rel="external">closing your account</a>, but please note that your withdrawal of consent will not be retroactive.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>LinkedIn Communications</h4>
        <p>
          As described in the User Agreement, we will communicate with you through email and notices posted on the LinkedIn website, messages to your LinkedIn inbox, or through other means available through the service, including mobile text messages. We may send you a series of emails that help inform new Users about the features of the Services, and we will also send you service messages relating to the functioning of the Services. We may also send you messages with promotional information directly or on behalf of our partners, unless you have opted out of receiving promotional information.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can change your e-mail and contact preferences at any time by logging into your account and changing your <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/secure/settings" rel="external">settings</a> related to your email notification choices. If you wish, you can also opt-out of receiving promotional emails by sending a request to LinkedIn customer service through <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Flinkedin%2Ecusthelp%2Ecom%2F&amp;urlhash=phDz" target="_blank" title="New window will open">our customer service site</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Please be aware that you cannot opt-out of receiving service messages from LinkedIn. Also, if we send communications to you via the carrier service with which you have a mobile communications subscription or otherwise have access, you understand you will pay any service fees associated with your receipt of messages on your mobile device (including text messaging charges).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>User Communications</h4>
        <p>
          Many communications you initiate through LinkedIn (e.g., an invitation sent to a non-User) will list your primary email address and name in the header of the message. Messages you initiate may also provide aggregate information about your network (for instance how many people are in your network), but will not list the people to whom you’re directly connected. Other communications that you initiate through the LinkedIn website, like a request for an introduction, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal email address contact information. Your contact information will only be shared with another User if both of you have indicated that you would like to establish contact with each other.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Customized Content</h4>
        <p>
          We use information provided to us (or to third parties with whom it offers combined services) to customize your experience on our website. For example, when you login to your account, we will display the names of new Users who have recently joined your network or recent status updates from your connections.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Sharing Information with Third Parties</h4>
        <p>
          LinkedIn takes the privacy of our Users very seriously, and we do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes.  Further, we will only share your personally identifiable information with third parties to carry out your instructions or to provide the Services or information unless compelled by law, or as necessary to enforce our User Agreement or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of LinkedIn, its Users, and the public.  For example, we use a credit card processing company to bill Users for subscription fees. These third parties do not retain, share, or store any personally identifiable information except to provide these services, and they are bound by confidentiality agreements limiting the use of your information.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also offer a “public profile” feature that allows Users to publish portions of their LinkedIn profile to the public internet. This public profile is what search engines will display when someone searches for your name. Users may opt-out of this feature by editing their account <a href="/myprofile?editwp=" rel="external">settings</a>; however, LinkedIn does not warrant how often third-party search engines will update their caches, which may contain old public profile information.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may provide aggregated anonymous data about the usage of the Services to third parties for purposes that we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate, including to prospective advertisers on LinkedIn.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Working with Third Parties to Offer Services.</h4>
        <p>
          We collaborate with third parties to offer services and functionality using LinkedIn developer tools such as our application programming interfaces (“APIs”). These third parties are either partners (“LinkedIn Partners”) with whom we have negotiated an agreement to provide services (“Combined Services”), or developers (“Platform Developers”) who have agreed to our API terms in our developer signup flow to build applications (“Platform Applications”). Both the negotiated agreements and our API terms and conditions contain restrictions on access, storage and use of your information.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you choose to use Combined Services or a Platform Application, you may be asked to confirm acceptance of the privacy policy and/or user agreement of the LinkedIn Partner or Platform Developer, which have not necessarily been reviewed or approved by LinkedIn. It is your choice whether or not to make use of Combined Services or Platform Applications and whether to proceed under any third party terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, despite our agreements and technical steps taken to restrict access to and avoid possible misuse of information we may not screen or audit all Combined Services or Platform Applications. We also cannot guarantee that any LinkedIn Partner or Platform Developer will abide by our agreement. You agree that your use of Combined Services or Platform Applications is on an “as is” basis and without any warranty.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you, your connections, members of your network, or other Users of LinkedIn use or interact with any Combined Service or Platform Application, the LinkedIn Partner or Platform Developer may access and share certain information about you with others, such as your profile information and information visible only to your connections. This includes information about your connections by virtue of you being connected to others. However, because a Combined Service or Platform Application can make calls on behalf of the User interacting with it to access non-public information, the level of detail accessible by the Combined Service or Platform Application through LinkedIn is constrained by the same settings that govern visibility of your data to that User on LinkedIn. For example, assuming you have not already given a Platform Developer’s application permission to access your information, your non-public profile information should not be visible to someone using the same Platform Application if it is not otherwise accessible to that person on LinkedIn. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Please also note that because of our relationship with certain LinkedIn Partners and Platform Developers, permission to access certain account information may be automatically granted to provide the combined services or functionality. You can view a list of LinkedIn Partners <a href="/static?key=application_directory">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To revoke permission granted to a Combined Service or Platform Application at any time, please visit the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/secure/settings?userAgree=" rel="external">settings page</a>. If the relevant Platform Developer or Application, or LinkedIn Partner is not listed under Authorized Applications, go directly to the Application Details page for the Platform Application you wish to uninstall. Note, however, that even if you revoke the permission granted a third party, your connections, other members of your network, or other Users of LinkedIn may still be using the Platform Application, so the Platform Application or Combined Service may still have access to certain information about you, just as those Users do. That is why it is important to only connect to Users you know and trust. To report any suspected misuse of information, contact LinkedIn’s customer service. LinkedIn is not responsible for your use of or inability to use any Combined Service or Platform Application, including the content, accuracy, or reliability of applications and the privacy practices or other policies of LinkedIn Partners or Platform Developers.

      <li>
        <h4>Polls and Surveys</h4>
        <p>
          Polls and Surveys may be conducted by LinkedIn, LinkedIn Users or third parties.  As a User, you may be invited to participate in polls and surveys from the LinkedIn website. Your selection may be random, or it may be based on your non-personally identifiable information, such as job title, geography, company size and/or industry.  Whether or not you decide to participate in a poll or survey is completely up to you. 
        </p>
        <p>
          After you complete a poll, you will be given access to the aggregate responses of the poll on a results page.  Some third parties may target advertisements to you on the results page based on your answers in the poll. Further, LinkedIn or third parties may follow up with you via InMail regarding your participation unless you have opted out of receiving InMail messages.  
        </p>
        <p>
          We may use third parties to deliver incentives to you to participate in surveys or polls.  If the delivery of incentives requires your contact information, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information to the third party fulfilling the incentive offer, which will only be used for the purpose of delivering incentives and/or verifying your contact information. It is up to you whether you provide this information, or whether you desire to take advantage of an incentive.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will not disclose any personally identifiable information to any third parties in connection with the conduct of any polls or surveys. Your consent to use any personally identifiable information for the purposes set forth in the poll or survey will be explicitly requested by the party conducting it.  LinkedIn is a member of the Council of American Survey Research Organizations (“CASRO”) and abides by CASRO guidelines for market research. You may opt-out of participating in Surveys by changing your <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/secure/settings?lrn=" rel="external">settings</a> to stop receiving these inquiries and requests.

        <h4>Search</h4>
        <p>
          We offer search services to help find information and learn more about other Users (for example, you can search for Users with particular expertise or consulting experience, or that you may know from your industry or profession), as well as employment opportunities. LinkedIn search also allows Users to find jobs, companies, and contributions to the community aspects of the LinkedIn Services, such as Groups and Answers that will help Users more effectively use LinkedIn and expand their network. We use information from User profiles and contributions to Groups and Answers to inform and refine our search service.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Answers, Groups, and other Services</h4>
        <p>
          If you post on the Answers section of LinkedIn, participate in LinkedIn Groups, or import a blog, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you choose to provide there can be read, collected, or used by other Users of these forums, as well as Platform Developers and other third parties, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. LinkedIn is not responsible for the information you choose to submit in these forums.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Testimonials and Advertisements Placed through LinkedIn DirectAds Service</h4>
        <p>
          If you provide any testimonials about the LinkedIn Services or place advertisements through the LinkedIn DirectAds, we may post those testimonials and examples of advertisements you place in connection with our promotion of these services to third parties. Testimonials and advertisements may include your name and other personal information that you have provided. For more information about DirectAds please see the <a href="/static?key=pop_sas_terms" onclick="LI.popup( '/static?key=pop_sas_terms', {} ); return false;" title="New window will open">DirectAds Terms of Use</a>.

      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Compliance with Legal Process</h4>
        <p>
          It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information, profile information and/or information about your activities as a LinkedIn User when required by subpoena or other legal process, or if LinkedIn has a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (a) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (b) to enforce the User Agreement, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property or personal safety of LinkedIn, our Users, employees, or others.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Disclosures to others</h4>
        <p>
          We may also disclose your personal information and other information you provide to another third party as part of a reorganization or a sale of the assets of LinkedIn Corporation, a subsidiary or division. Any third party to which LinkedIn transfers or sells LinkedIn’s assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us.

        <h4>Accessing and Changing Your Account Information</h4>
        <p>
          You can review the personal information you provided to us and make any desired changes to the information you publish, or to the settings for your LinkedIn account including your email and contact preferences, at any time by logging in to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/secure/settings" rel="external">your account</a> on the LinkedIn website. Please be aware that even after your request for a change is processed, LinkedIn may, for a time, retain residual information about you in its backup and/or archival copies of its database.

      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Default Settings</h4>
        <p>
          Because the mission of LinkedIn is to connect the world’s professionals to enable them to become more productive and successful, we have established what we believe to be reasonable default settings that we have found most professionals desire.  Because Users may use and interact with LinkedIn in a variety of ways, and because those uses may change over time, we designed our settings to provide our users granular control over the information they share.  We encourage our Users to review their account settings and adjust them in accordance with their preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          LinkedIn accounts are also defaulted to allow Users to be contacted to participate in polls, surveys and partner advertising. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/secure/settings" rel="external">Click here</a> to change these settings.

      <li>
        <h4>Closing Your Account</h4>
        <p>
          You can close your account through the LinkedIn customer service site.  If you close your LinkedIn account, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our publicly viewable database. If you close your account, we have no obligation to retain your information, and may delete any or all of your account information without liability. However, we may retain certain data contributed by you if LinkedIn believes it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law.  LinkedIn may also retain and use your information if necessary to provide the Services to other Users. For example, just as an email you may send to another person through an email service provider resides in that person’s inbox even after you delete it from your sent files or close your account, emails or InMails you send on LinkedIn to other Users, as well as your contributions to LinkedIn Answers or Groups, may remain visible to others after you have closed your account. Similarly, other information you have shared with others, or that other Users have copied, may also remain visible. LinkedIn disclaims any liability in relation to the deletion or retention (subject to the terms herein) of information or any obligation not to delete the information.  LinkedIn does not control when search engines update their cache, which may contain certain public profile information that has since been removed from LinkedIn’s publicly viewable database.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Memorializing Accounts</h4>
        <p>
          If we learn that a User is deceased, we may memorialize the User’s account. In these cases we may restrict profile access, remove messaging functionality, and close an account if we receive a formal request from the User’s next of kin or other proper legal request to do so.

    <h3 id="pri-4">Your Obligations</h3>
    <p>
      As a User, you have certain obligations to other Users. Some of these obligations are imposed by applicable law and regulations, and others have become commonplace in user-friendly communities of like-minded members such as LinkedIn:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
      <li>You must, at all times, abide by the terms and conditions of the then-current Privacy Policy and User Agreement. This includes respecting all intellectual property rights that may belong to third parties (such as trademarks or photographs).</li>
      <li>You must not download or otherwise disseminate any information that may be deemed to be injurious, violent, offensive, racist or xenophobic, or which may otherwise violate the purpose and spirit of LinkedIn and its community of Users.</li>
      <li>You must not provide to LinkedIn and/or other Users information that you believe might be injurious or detrimental to your person or to your professional or social status.</li>
      <li>You must keep your username and password confidential and not share it with others.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Any violation of these guidelines may lead to the restriction, suspension or termination of your account at the sole discretion of LinkedIn.

        <h4>TRUSTe and Safe Harbor</h4>

Because LinkedIn wants to demonstrate our commitment to our Users’ privacy, we have agreed to disclose our privacy practices and have them reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also participate in the EU Safe Harbor Privacy Framework as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce and have also self-certified our privacy practices as consistent with U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor principles: Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Access and Accuracy, Security, Data Integrity and Enforcement. As part of our participation in the Safe Harbor Privacy Framework, LinkedIn has agreed to TRUSTe dispute resolution for disputes relating to our compliance with it. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that by becoming a User, you have given us your express and informed consent to transfer the data that you provide to us to the United States and to process it in the United States.

        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy at any time, with or without advance notice. In the event there are significant changes in the way we treat your personally identifiable information, or in the Privacy Policy document itself, we will display a notice on the LinkedIn website or send you an email, as provided for above.

    <h3 id="pri-6">Security</h3>
    <p>
      In order to help secure your personal information, access to your data on LinkedIn is password-protected, and sensitive data (such as credit card information) is protected by SSL encryption when it is exchanged between your web browser and the LinkedIn website. To protect any data you store on our servers, LinkedIn also regularly audits its system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we use a tier-one secured-access data center. However, since the internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to LinkedIn. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that emails, instant messaging, and similar means of communication with other Users of LinkedIn are not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means.
