8\. Jobbuddy Profile

Jobbuddy provides registered members with the option of creating a personal profile. A profile includes your CV, employment and educational history, contact details, minimum salary expectation and the classifications and locations ('Profile') registered members would like to work in. Registered members' profiles can be seen by Jobbuddy clients who place job ads in matching classifications and locations. Members can of course choose to hide their profile at any time. Registered members' Profiles will remain  anonymous until the Jobbuddy client purchases access to a registered members CV and contact details. Jobbuddy provides registered members with the following privacy options in relation to the access allowed to their Profile:

Provide resume and contact details immediately

When a Jobbuddy client purchases a registered member’s Profile that resume and the contact details in that resume will be emailed immediately to the relevant JOBBUDDY client.

Hide or delete Profile

Registered members can elect to hide their Profile, so JOBBUDDY clients cannot see Private Profile at all, whilst allowing the Profile to be stored in the My Account area of the site. Alternatively Registered Members can elect to delete their Profile. Deleting a Profile from the My Account area of the site will mean it is no longer accessible to the registered member. Please note that deleted Profiles may still be stored by JOBBUDDY in testing or backup systems for a period of time.

All information provided when creating a Profile including name, resume, email address, telephone numbers, employment and educational history are used for the purposes of facilitating registered members job seeking efforts.

Registered Members can modify, hide or delete their resume at any time.

JOBBUDDY reserves the right to disable or delete a Profile at their sole discretion.
