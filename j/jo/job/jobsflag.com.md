At times, you may request that your information be submitted to another site. It is possible that the selected site will not accept your information for various reasons, including that you are out of the area which the site serves, or your request duplicates another you already made. jobsflag.com has no control over this occurring. In addition, even though a site does not accept your information, both we and that site may store your information and your information may subsequently be utilized to send to you offers or follow-up e-mails from jobsflag.com, one of our partners or affiliates, or by the site which did not originally accept your information.

or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems. 

Federal and state regulations may require that we maintain certain information (including your personal information) submitted through our website for various time periods. In order to comply with these regulations, we cannot delete your information from our database if to do so is not permitted by an applicable law or regulation.
