We respect your right to privacy. Our relationship with you is valuable and we understand the importance you place on the privacy and security of information that personally identifies you. In that respect, whether you are a first time visitor to our website ("Website") or a regular user, we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy and information handling practices.

## Personal details

We collect personal information from you when you register with us and when you use our services. Information we collect includes name, email address and other contact details. We use this information to provide our services to you and to communicate with you generally.

Your express permission will always be requested before an employer is able to view your personal details in our Talent Pool. Alternatively you can opt to allow all employers to view your details without first requesting express permission. These permission settings can be altered, only by you, at any time.

It is not our practice to rent or sell your details or otherwise share them with organisations or individuals not connected with the Website. However, we may disclose personal data when we deem it appropriate on the sale of the whole or any related part of our business and/or assets, and/or in order to comply with applicable law.

## Cookies

This Website uses cookies to identify repeat visitors. Cookies are small data files that certain websites (including this one) write to your hard drive when you visit them. Please note that we only use cookies to enhance your browsing experience and we protect your privacy by only storing a simple ID number and token string that is only meaningful to this Website. Your personal details, such as your name or phone number, are not stored in a cookie.

## Security

This Website has security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse and/or unauthorised alteration of personal information under our control. You can gain access to your profile and modify the information stored there by supplying a username and password. You must ensure that this information is not given to anyone else. The effectiveness of our safety measures can be enhanced by you creating passwords that cannot be accessed, guessed or reproduced easily by unauthorised persons.

This Website uses SSL encryption technology to ensure personal data transmitted to our Website cannot be accessed by external parties. All employers are required to access a password protected area of the Website before being given access to your personal details, including your email address.

## Changes to Privacy Statement

We may edit this statement and/or our privacy policies and practices at any time without notice (although if we do so in a significant way, we shall endeavour to notify visitors by posting a notice on our Website).
