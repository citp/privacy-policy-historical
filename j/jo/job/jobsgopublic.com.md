  7. ### How do we protect personal data?

    1. Security is a high priority for us. We take appropriate precautions to protect personal data. 
    2. Email and other electronic communications are not secure if they have not been encrypted. Your communications will pass through a number of network nodes before they reach us.

Nor can we be held responsible for the actions or omissions of other users or third parties who may misuse your personal data which they collect from the website. 
  8. ### To whom do we disclose personal data?

      2. in the case of an actual or proposed (including negotiations for a) sale or merger or business combination involving all or the relevant part of our business.

    6. Except as otherwise specifically included in this policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to third parties, whether they are suppliers of services on our or other websites, different rules will apply to their use or disclosure of your information. Please check their privacy policies carefully. 
  9. ### How can you access and rectify personal data?

    1. You have the right to request personal data that we hold about you, subject to us reserving the right to withhold such data to the extent permitted by law.
