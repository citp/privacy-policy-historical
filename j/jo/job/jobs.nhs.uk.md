The data you submit to NHS Jobs as part of your job application may be downloaded and transferred to the employers' own system or a third party system where an employer chooses to complete the recruitment process using a different system.

If you apply for a job on NHS Jobs then the employer which advertised the job will have access to your application and any other material you submit in support of the application for example, your accompanying CV. Employers may copy and hold some or all of this data locally in their own systems to facilitate their administration of the recruitment exercise.

An employing organisation has an obligation to inform you how they are processing your application before you apply including but not limited to:

  * automatic decision making on selection,
  * updating information the employing organisation has downloaded from NHS Jobs,
  * withdrawing an application the employing organisation has downloaded from NHS Jobs
  * how the employing organisation handles attachments that accompany the application form
  * what the employing organisation uses the Equality and Diversity data for
  * how the employing organisation handle any safeguarding concerns



An employing organisation has an obligation to provide any relevant privacy notice(s) when a request for an off line application is made.
