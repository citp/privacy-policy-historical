    <h2>Information That We Collect</h2>

The first type of personal information we collect is anything you actively choose to disclose to JobSeeq ("Active Information"). The second type of information is anonymous aggregate information collected in a way that is not visible to you or others visiting the site ("Passive Information").</p>

    <h2>Active Information</h2>

    <p>JobSeeq may collect or receive Active Information about you when you submit your personally identifiable information, including, but not limited to, your username, password, first and last name, email address, street address, gender, occupation, interests, job search history, and any other data included in any submitted profile or search. JobSeeq also collects information on the pages you access through our site and any other information you may volunteer, such as survey information, ratings, reviews, questions, and answers.</p>

    <h2>Passive Information</h2>

    <p>JobSeeq may also collect your Passive Information by recording actions taken by you on our site including, but not limited to, clicks, page views, IP address, and search queries. We may store this information in our equipment or the equipment of third party technology providers. We use this type of information to administer the Site and provide the highest possible level of service to you.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <p>JobSeeq will only use your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>For the purpose of identifying users and delivering relevant content and advertisements, our partner LiveRamp may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser or a unique ID for your mobile device.

    <h2>Email Communications</h2>

    <p>JobSeeq respects your email preferences and will never provide your email address to a third party without your permission, except as may be prescribed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

    <h2>Protect Yourself</h2>

    <p>JobSeeq uses automated processes and third party aggregators to collect and present information that has been created by third parties, so we cannot verify the accuracy or legitimacy of all job postings displayed on our site.

    <p>Never provide your social security number, credit card information, bank account details, or unnecessary personal information to a potential employer. Never participate in a financial transaction of any sort with a potential employer.
