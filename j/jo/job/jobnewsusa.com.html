Unless you tell us otherwise, we may use this information to make you aware of opportunities, job openings, services, products, site changes, etc., which we believe may be of interest to you. Providing supplemental information is strictly voluntary, and you will not be subject to any adverse action or treatment if you choose not to provide such information. We respect your account’s communication settings.<br><br><strong>Job Seeker Resume Information</strong><br><br>You may post up to three (3) resumes at a time. What you put in any resume must be true and accurate to the best of your knowledge. Job News is under no obligation to verify any information you supply, including your identity. Your resume(s) will be accessible to all employers and customers who pay for access to resumes. If you do not wish to post a resume for all interested employers, simply apply for jobs one at a time without uploading a resume to your My Resumes page.<br><br><br><br>You may edit or delete a resume at any time. However, customers and other users of our site may have already retained a copy of your resume in their own files. Job News is not responsible for the use, retention or disclosure of any resumes or other information about you that has been posted publicly at any time.<br><br>General Information Disclosure<br><br>Your public profile will be accessible to all our customers who pay for access (including employers, advertisers, recruiters, headhunters, human resource professionals, data aggregators, marketers, or government agencies, such as law enforcement and national security agencies).
