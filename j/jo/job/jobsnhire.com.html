When This Privacy Policy Applies.</h2><p>This Privacy Policy applies whether  you are accessing the Site via a personal computer, a mobile device or any  other technology or devices now known or hereafter developed or discovered  (each, a "Device") and whether you are accessing the Site as a  registered user (if offered by the Site) or other user of the Site. This  Privacy Policy governs only the Personal Information and Other Information (as  those terms are defined below) collected by the Site and does not cover any  such information collected in any other manner, the Parent Companies and/or any  subsidiaries and affiliates of the Parent Companies (collectively,  "Affiliates") or collected by any other company, unless specifically  stated. We may from time to time, combine Information (as that term is defined  below) with other information we collect from other sources, such as information  received from our Parent Companies, Affiliates, marketing companies or  Advertisers and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information  will be subject to this Privacy Policy.</p><p>This Privacy Policy will remain in  full force and effect, even if your use of or participation in the Site or any  particular service, feature, function or promotional activity offered through  the Site terminates, expires, ceases, is suspended or deactivated for any  reason. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate  in the Site or any features, activities or services offered through the Site.</p><h2>2.    U.S. Governing Law; Safe Harbor.</h2><p>The Site is designed and targeted to  U.S. audiences and is governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of  the U.S. We make no representation that this Site is operated in accordance  with the laws or regulations of, or governed by, other nations. By  participating in our Site activities, you certify that you meet the age and  other eligibility requirements for this Site as set forth in our Terms of Use  Agreement. If you do not meet such age and other eligibility requirements,  please discontinue using the Site immediately as your continued use of the Site  indicates that you are agreeing to the collection, use, disclosure, management  and storage of your Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>If you are located outside of the  U.S., the European Economic Area and Switzerland, you use this Site at your own  risk and initiative and you, not us, are responsible for compliance with any  applicable local and national laws. If this Site is part of the Flux platform,  by using this Site, participating in any Site activities, and/or providing us  with your Personal Information and Other Information, you (i) consent to the  transfer and/or processing of any Information you provide to the Site and to  Flux, (ii) acknowledge that U.S. law may provide a lower standard of protection  for personal data than the laws of your location and (iii) understand that this  Site and Flux will collect, transfer, store, process and/or deal with your Information  in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Flux Privacy Policy and U.S.  law. Consequently, to the full extent permitted by law, you hereby waive any  claims relating to the processing of your Personal Information or Other Information  in accordance with this Privacy Policy that may arise under the laws and  regulations that apply to you in or of any other country or jurisdiction.</p><h2>3.

When we use the term "Other Information", we mean  any information other than Personal Information that may be collected about you  (Personal Information and Other Information, together, the "Information").</p><p><strong>a. Information We Collect that You Provide Us.</strong></p><ol><li>i. User Registration. To the       extent we offer user registration on the Site, to register as a member of       the Site, you are required to select a user name and password (together,       your "User ID") and may be required to also provide other Information,       such as your email address and date of birth.

To sign up for       or participate in these features or functions, you may be required to       provide us with certain Information about you in order for us to       personalize and/or allow you to use such features and functions. For       example, to sign up to receive email newsletters, you may be required to       provide your email address, date of birth and zip code separate from any       user registration. Further, for example, to the extent we offer such       services, if you order any of our various Products (as defined in the       Terms of Use Agreement), in addition to your name and contact information,       we will also collect and may maintain your billing address, shipping       address, Product selections, your credit card or other payment instrument information,       your order number and information about your computer's internet address       and website which may have referred or directed you to the Site (e.g., the       referring URL). Your credit card or debit card number is collected via a       secure transmission.</li><li>iii. In Connection with       Promotions such as Contests and Sweepstakes.

Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.</strong></p><p>"Cookies" (which may be  html files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store  user preferences and activity. "Web beacons" (also known as image  tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising  data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses.  The Site and/or third parties may use "cookies", "web  beacons" and other similar tracking technologies (collectively,  "Tracking Technologies") to collect Other Information automatically  as you browse the Site and the web.</p><p>We use Tracking Technologies to help  tailor our content, allow users to move between associated sites without  logging into each site, understand Site and internet usage, improve or  customize the content, offerings or advertisements on this Site, personalize  your experience on this Site (for example, to recognize you by name when you  return to the Site), understand your interactions with email messages (such as  the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded), save  your password in password-protected areas, save your online game or video  player settings, enable you to use shopping carts on the Site, help us offer  you products, programs or services that may be of interest to you, deliver  relevant advertising, maintain and administer the Site and for other purposes  described in the "Use of Information", "Other Information  Collected by Us" section below. These Tracking Technologies collect  "click stream" data and additional Other Information regarding your  visits to the Site, such as your visits to the Site's webpages, use of our  features, and purchasing history or preferences and may also collect your IP  address or some other identifier unique to the Device you use to access the  Site ("Identifier").

These Third Party Advertising Service Providers may enable us to display  advertisements based on your visits to the Site and other websites you have  visited.

You may also  use the opt-out mechanism that is contained in each such email. Please note  that when you opt-out of receiving marketing and promotional e-mails from us,  you are not opting out of receiving newsletters from us that you have  requested. Further, when you use the opt-out mechanism that is contained in an  email, you are not opting out of receiving marketing and promotional e-mails  from other VMN brands. Please see Section 4.a.ii below for your newsletter  options.</p><p><strong>ii. In  Connection with Wireless Marketing Services.</strong> See "Termination of Wireless Services by Users"  under the "Wireless Marketing Services and Associated Promotional  Opportunities" Section for more information on how you may unsubscribe  from receiving text messages.</p><p><strong>iii.  Certain Continuing Rights Regardless of Opt-Outs. </strong>However, even if you exercise your opt-out rights above, we,  or our Parent Companies or Affiliates, may continue to contact you for the  other purposes described in the "Use of Information" Section above,  such as for maintenance and administrative purposes.            </p><p><strong>b.  Opting-Out of Use of Certain Other Information Collected by Tracking  Technologies.</strong></p><p><strong>i.  Tracking Technologies Set By Third Party Advertising Service Providers and  Advertisers.</strong> With  respect to the Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Advertising Service  Providers and Advertisers, you have a number of options:            </p><ul type="disc"><li>Third Party Advertising Service       Providers and Advertisers may collect Other Information about you when you       visit this Site to help identify products and services that may interest       you and deliver advertising tailored to your interests.</li><li>You can opt-out of the use of       Other Information for these advertising purposes by two such Third Party       Advertising Service Providers, Adobe Audience Manager (formerly known as       Demdex) and DoubleClick/Google, by using those Third Party Advertising       Service Providers' opt-out tools. You can access Adobe Audience Manager/Demdex's       tool athttp://www.donottarget.com/ and Double Click's tool at       http://www.google/com/intl/en/privacy/ads/ or as described in the next       bullet point.</li><li>We also may from time to time       permit other Third Party Advertising Service Providers and Advertisers to       collect Other Information on the Site. Some of these Third Party       Advertising Service Providers and Advertisers may participate in the       Network Advertising Initiative's Opt-Out Tool and/or the Self-Regulatory       Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. Please click on the links to       these tools to learn more about your choices.</li><li>Please note the following with       respect to opting out:</li><li>The opt-out tools discussed       above are "cookie based." This means that the tools rely on       cookies to remember your choices with respect to the use of your information       by the parties that offer you those choices.

The opt-out preferences that you choose will apply only to the Web browser       that you used when you selected these preferences. This means, for       example, that if you opt-out while using Internet Explorer 9, this choice       will not affect the use of Other Information collected by Tracking       Technologies when you use Mozilla Firefox on the same Device. It also       means that opting-out on one Device will not affect the use of Other Information       by Tracking Technologies on other Devices that you may use to access the       Site.</li></ul><p>PLEASE NOTE THAT THE USE AND STORAGE  OF FLASH COOKIES TYPICALLY CANNOT BE CONTROLLED THROUGH YOUR BROWSER.

Depending on  the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other Information  and, depending on the Information collected, the user may also be required to  confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use  Agreement.</p><p>We caution that most wireless  transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third  party's interception of messages or a user's Personal Information when using a  wireless communications device.</p><p>Users  that register for Jobs &amp; Hire' wireless marketing services  acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the user's  wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from Jobs &amp; Hire. Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. Under no  circumstances will the Site, Jobs &amp; Hire, its Parent Companies  or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges  incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user's wireless device,  telephone number, or email address.</p><p><strong>a.  Registration.</strong> To the  extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration  methods provided for Jobs &amp; Hire?? wireless marketing services.  Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the "single  opt-in" or the "double-opt-in" (Site/SMS) method, at the  discretion of Jobs &amp; Hire depending on the type of Promotion.  Premium rate services will require the "double opt-in" (Site/SMS or  SMS/SMS) method.</p><p><strong>i. Single  Opt-in Method: </strong>In  response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages,  users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a  designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. The user's  voluntary submission of the designated word or code to Jobs &amp; Hire will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission  to Jobs &amp; Hire to send text messages to him or her. Jobs &amp; Hire will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a  "Thank you" message. The user may terminate the service at any time  by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from Jobs &amp; Hire or by sending a text message to Jobs &amp; Hire that says  "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE",  "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT".</p><p><strong>ii. Double  Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method:</strong> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional  messages, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration  process. The user must affirmatively consent to Jobs &amp; Hire' sending  of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a  telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by Jobs &amp; Hire) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site's registration  page. The user must also agree to the Site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use  Agreement before the online registration process is completed. Jobs &amp; Hire will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's  designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or  she has agreed to receive messages from Jobs &amp; Hire to that  particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The  user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message  that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's  acceptance of Jobs &amp; Hire' wireless marketing service. Until the  user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not  registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the  Promotion. A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any  time provided that Jobs &amp; Hire may choose to terminate offering  wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation"  is only valid if the response is received while Jobs &amp; Hire continues  to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</p><p><strong>iii.  Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method: </strong>In  response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages,  users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a  designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. Jobs &amp; Hire will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's  designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or  she has agreed to receive messages from Jobs &amp; Hire to that  particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The  user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message  that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's  acceptance of Jobs &amp; Hire' wireless marketing service. Until the  user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not  registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the  Promotion. A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any  time provided that Jobs &amp; Hire may choose to terminate offering  wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation"  is only valid if the response is received while Jobs &amp; Hire  continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</p><p><strong>b.  Termination of Wireless Services by User.</strong> Regardless of which one of the above opt-in methods was  used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive messages from Jobs &amp; Hire by the following procedure:</p><p>A user may cancel one or more  services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe  mechanism provided by Jobs &amp; Hire at the time the message is  sent, or by sending a text message that says "STOP", "END",  "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or  "QUIT". Jobs &amp; Hire will terminate the user's  registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user. Any of  these words followed by the word "ALL" in the user's termination request  will cancel all of the user's registered wireless services with Jobs &amp; Hire. If the user unsubscribes from one or all of Jobs &amp; Hire service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be  terminated immediately and will cancel the user's previous opt-in.</p><p><strong>c.  Termination of Wireless Services by Jobs &amp; Hire.</strong> A user understands, acknowledges  and agrees that Jobs &amp; Hire may, in its sole discretion and  without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless  marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without  advance notice. Jobs &amp; Hire may provide notice of terminations  or changes in services on this Site.</p><p><strong>d. Use of Information.</strong> Jobs &amp; Hire will not  use a wireless telephone number, wireless or conventional Internet email  address, or other Information submitted for its wireless marketing services for  any other purpose but to provide the service requested, unless we provide  advance notice of any other use. We will not share any Personal Information  with Advertisers or other third party marketers unless you opt-in to such  disclosure. We will share Personal Information with the operational service  providers that assist us in delivering these wireless services to you and with  the Parent Companies and Affiliates.</p><h2>6. Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Information and Other Information.</h2><p><strong>a. Sharing  and Disclosure of Personal Information.</strong> Generally, we do not sell, rent, lease or disclose your Personal  Information to third parties, except if you consent to such disclosure or as  described in this Privacy Policy.</p><ul type="disc"><li>i. Disclosure to Parent       Companies and Affiliates. We may disclose Personal Information to Parent       Companies and Affiliates for marketing and/or administrative purposes. You       can choose to opt-out of certain such uses as described in the       "Opting-Out of Certain Uses of Personal Information" Section       above.</li><li>ii. Disclosure of Certain Information       in Postings Intended to Be Disclosed. Certain Personal Information       associated with a Posting may be intended for disclosure ("Posting Information"),       such as username. We will disclose Posting Information in connection with       the display of, and other services relating to, such Posting.</li><li>iii. Disclosure In Connection       with Co-Branded Services and Features. The Site may also offer co-branded       services and features, such as events and Promotions that we put together       with another company or our Parent Companies or Affiliates       ("Co-Branded Partner") and that may be hosted on the Site and/or       our Co-Branded Partner's website. We may share your Personal Information       with our Co-Branded Partner and your voluntary use of or participation in       a co-branded service or feature means that you opt-in and give your       affirmative consent to both the Site and our Co-Branded Partner to collect       the Information provided in connection with the specific co-branded       feature or service and to use such Information for the fulfillment of the       feature or service and for marketing or administrative purposes. The       Co-Branded Partner will be identified on the co-branded feature or       service, along with the Co-Branded partner's privacy policy. If you wish       to opt-out of a Co-Branded Partner's future use of your Personal       Information for marketing purposes, you will need to contact the       Co-Branded Partner directly and the use of such information by Co-Branded       Partner is subject to Co-Branded Partner's privacy policy.</li><li>iv. Disclosure to Operational       Service Providers. We also have the right to disclose your Personal       Information and Other Information to third parties for the purpose of       administering and maintaining the Site's services, features, functions and       operations. We will refer to these third parties as "operational       service providers". We use operational service providers to       efficiently provide the full range of content, activities, services,       features and functions we bring you and we disclose your Information to       operational service providers for the purpose of providing services to us.</li><li>v. Disclosure to Certain Other       Third Parties. In addition to the above, we will make your Personal       Information and Other Information available to certain third parties in       the following limited circumstances:</li><li>When we are compelled to do so       by a governmental agency, court or other entity (e.g., to respond to       subpoenas, court orders or legal process) or if requested by a       governmental agency or other authority as part of an investigation;</li><li>If we believe your actions       violate any law, rule, regulation and/or the Terms of Use Agreement,       including, without limitation, this Privacy Policy, Rules or Additional       Terms;</li><li>In connection with Promotions,       as necessary to administer the Promotion or as required by applicable       laws, rules or regulations (for example, to provide winners' lists or make       required filings as appropriate);</li><li>If you opt-in or otherwise       agree to have your Personal Information shared with or otherwise disclosed       to a third party for marketing purposes, in which case the third party's       use of your information is subject to the third party's own privacy       policy;</li><li>If, in our sole discretion, we       believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate: to investigate or       resolve possible problems or inquiries; to protect our business and assets       or the rights, property or safety of the Site, the Parent Companies, the       Affiliates, or any of its or their operational service providers,       licensors, suppliers, Advertisers, customers, users, or any other party;       to limit our legal liability; to defend our interests; to enforce this       Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use Agreement and/or to comply with our       legal and regulatory obligations or requests by law enforcement agencies       or governmental authorities and/or</li><li>In the event of a bankruptcy,       merger, acquisition, sale, transfer of control, joint venture or other       business combination involving us, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates.</li></ul><p><strong>b. Sharing  and Disclosure of Other Information. </strong>We may share or otherwise disclose other information with  third parties, but we do not disclose Personal Information to them except as  described in this Privacy Policy.</p><h2>7.    Reviewing, Updating or Deleting Certain Information.</h2><p>Generally, you may review, update or  delete certain information collected by the Site by clicking  "Account" on the homepage to sign in to your Site account with your  User ID to change, update or deactivate your Personal Information. However, Personal  Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or  age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the  correct information. We will allow you to change the password portion of your  User ID, as well as certain other information you have given us in order to  keep your information current, but once you select a user name you will not be  able to change that user name provided to us during registration and which is  associated with your User ID.</p><p>You may also exercise certain  privacy settings options by, if you are a registered user of the Site and  logged into the Site, clicking "Profile" or your display name at the  top of the Site, selecting "Edit Profile" or "Manage  Account" and selecting the "Privacy" tab.</p><p>Certain information collected for  certain entries into Promotions are subject to corporate and regulatory  recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user's request,  unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.</p><p>If the burden or expense of  providing access to your information is disproportionate to the risks to your  privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide  not to provide access to such information. In such cases, we will provide to  you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for  further inquiries.</p><p>Children or Ineligible Teenagers..  If we, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates, inadvertently send an email or  text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility  requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or  others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of this  Site ("Ineligible Teenagers"), the child (or Ineligible Teenager) or  the child's (or Ineligible Teenager's) parent or legal guardian (the  "Parent") always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from  receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism  contained in the email or message. The same unsubscribe process is available to  a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age  of majority in your state).</p><p>In addition, Parents of children or  Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their child's or Ineligible  Teenager's membership must use their child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID  to gain direct access to the account, and follow the procedures in the  "Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use" Section of the  Terms of Use Agreement to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's member;  alternatively, Parents may send an email to the Site's Privacy Administrator  and provide us with your child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID and request  to terminate your child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration. We  will not allow direct access to a user's account and Personal Information by  any person without the user's User ID. If a Parent does not have his or her  child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID, the Parent will be required to send  an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the Parent's name, address,  telephone and email address, in addition to the child's or Ineligible  Teenager's name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child's  or Ineligible Teenager's date of birth. The Parent must also provide verifiable  identification that they are the parent or legal guardian of the child or  Ineligible Teenager. Jobs &amp; Hire will send a confirming email to  the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to  terminate his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration.  The Parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return  address. International Realty will then terminate the child's or Ineligible  Teenager's account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the  termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email  address of the person making the request.</p><h2>8.    Protection of Information.</h2><p>While no data transmission over the  Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we maintain commercially reasonable  physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information.  However, regardless of our efforts and the Device you use to access the Site,  it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access  transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We  conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always  secure other parts of the Site. We also limit access to the Site by our own  employees to those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of  such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and  confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that  our operational service providers follow similar standards of security and  confidentiality.</p><p><strong>Phishing.</strong> Phishing attacks attempt to steal  consumers' personal identity data and financial account credentials.  "Phishers" use 'spoofed' e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit  websites designed to trick recipients into divulging information such as credit  card numbers, account usernames, passwords and social security numbers. WE DO  NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM CREDIT CARD NUMBERS, SOCIAL  SECURITY NUMBERS OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD! If you receive such email  communication, please forward it immediately to the Site's Privacy  Administrator at info@jobsnhire.com , and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from  your computer.</p><h2>9. Your New York State Privacy Rights.</h2><p>If you are a resident of the State  of New York State, we provide you with information on how to exercise your  disclosure choice options such as your right to opt-out (which we may sometimes  refer to as "unsubscribe") or opt-in for use of your Information by  third parties (such as Advertisers) for marketing purposes. Therefore, pursuant  to the New York State Civil Code, we are not required to maintain or disclose a  list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing  purposes during the preceding year.</p><p>If you are a New York State resident  and wish to request information about how to exercise your third party  disclosure choices, please send a request by email to the Privacy Administrator  at info@jobsnhire.com , Attn: Your New York State Privacy Rights, c/o Privacy  Administrator.</p><p>All requests must be labeled  "Your New York State Privacy Rights" on the email subject line or  envelope or post card. For all requests, please clearly state that the request  is related to "Your New York State Privacy Rights", include your  name, street address, city, state, zip code and e-mail address (your street  address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via  email) and indicate your preference on how our response to your request should  be sent (email or postal mail). We will not accept requests via the telephone  or by facsimile. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or  sent properly, or do not have complete information.</p><h2>10.    Changes to this Privacy Policy and Notice.</h2><p>We reserve the right to revise this  Privacy Policy at any time by posting an updated Privacy Policy without advance  notice to you. Such revisions shall be effective immediately upon posting.  Notice of material changes will be posted on the Site's homepage and/or will be  provided by e-mailing you or notifying you upon login about these changes; the  form of such notice is at our discretion. However, we encourage you to check  this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement often for updates.</p><h2>11.    Miscellaneous.</h2><p><strong>a.  Accuracy and Confidentiality.</strong> It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information,  including Personal Information, and to keep such information up to date. We  cannot and will not be responsible for any problems or liability that may arise  if you do not give us accurate, truthful or complete information or Personal  Information or you fail to update such information or Personal Information. We  will reject and delete any entry that we believe in good faith to be false,  fraudulent or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.</p><p>You are solely responsible for  maintaining the strict confidentiality of your User ID, if applicable, and for  any charges, costs, expenses, damages, liabilities and losses we incur or may  suffer as a result of your failure to do so. You, and not us, are solely  responsible and liable for the activity, behavior, use and conduct on the Site  under your User ID (whether used by you or any others who use your User ID),  unless and until you notify us that your User ID may have been compromised,  misappropriated or improperly taken or used by another party. We reserve the  right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user, including  without limitation, a registered user, of any services, features or functions  of the Site if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person  trying to access the user's account or any services, features or functions.</p><p>Further, if you use any of the  Communities features and functions made available on or through the Site,  please remember that any information disclosed in these venues is automatically  made public and please use caution when disclosing any Personal Information in  the Communities, as you do not know who will access and use your Personal  Information or for what purposes. Jobs &amp; Hire is in no way  responsible for the accuracy, use, or misuse of any information, including Personal  Information, that you disclose or receive through these venues and you should  assume that any disclosure you do make in these venues will be available  publicly, even without your knowledge or authorization.</p><p><strong>b.  Questions.</strong> If you have questions about this  Privacy Policy or if you do not understand any information about how we  collect, maintain, use or share your Personal Information or other information,  you may contact us directly by sending an email to info@jobsnhire.com</p><p><strong>c. Sole  Statement:</strong> This document is the sole statement  of the Site's Privacy Policy and no summary, restatement or other version  thereof, or other privacy statement or policy, in any form, including, but not  limited to, machine-generated, is valid.</p><p><strong>d. Other:</strong> Please review our Terms of Use  Agreement which governs your use of the Site. Any terms that are not defined in  this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given in the Terms of Use Agreement.</p><p>This Privacy Policy was last  modified on the date indicated above and is effective immediately.</p><p class="txtgray"></p></div><div class="clear"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar">
