        <h2>Overview</h2><br>
        <span class="bullet01">
        <ul>
            <li>Company is committed to respecting the privacy of our users. This Privacy Statement
                sets forth the online data collection and usage policies and practices that apply
                to the website and does not apply to information we collect in any other fashion.<br>
                <br>
                The information gathered on this website may be shared within Company and its affiliated
                companies on a worldwide basis in order to deliver the products and services we
                offer to employers such as searches for job seekers or in order to undertake analysis
                of our database such as aggregate profiling of our users. "Affiliated companies"
                mean entities that control, are controlled by or are under common control with Company.
                <br>

                The website contains links to other web sites over which we have no control. We
                are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other web sites to
                which you choose to link from our website. We encourage you to review the privacy
                policies of those other web sites so you can understand how they collect, use and

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2><br>
        <span class="bullet01">
        <ul>
            <li>You can generally visit our website without revealing any personally identifiable
                information about yourself. However, in certain sections of this website, to use
                certain services, we may require you to create an account, or we may invite you
                to submit questions or comments or request information, subscribe to a newsletter,
                participate in surveys, questionnaires or contests, or message boards. Due to the
                nature of some of these activities, we may ask that you complete and submit an online
                form with personally identifiable information such as your name, username, email
                address, contact information, employment information. If you have created an account,
                you may opt to provide additional personally identifiable information in your profile
                such as your age, gender and employment information. Providing any additional personally
                identifiable information beyond what is required to create an account is optional.
                We may use your personally identifiable information to deliver certain services,
                products or information you have requested, verify your authority to enter certain
                password protected areas of the website, send you notices for services that you
                have used or that may be of interest to you, and improve the content and general
                administration of the website. We may receive your personally identifiable information
                from our partners that provide us with third-party services so that we can customize
                and improve the services that we may provide to you. Additionally, if you have elected
                to reveal your email address to other registered members, they will have access
                to and be able to use your email address.</li>
        </ul></span><br>
        
        <h2>Other Usage of Information</h2><br>
        <span class="bullet01">
        <ul>
            <li>We may also share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to this website
                with our clients, partners and other third parties so that they can understand the
                kinds of visitors to this website and how those visitors use the website. We may
                disclose your personally identifiable information and aggregate information to our
                partner entities that provide job networking services to us in order to confirm
                your accounts with such partner entities. Any organization to which we provide your
                personally identifiable information may not further distribute your personally identifiable
                information and may not use your information for commercial purposes. We will also
                disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are
                required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority. We will not
                sell your personally identifiable information to any other company or organization
                except we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity
                upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Company
                participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of Company's assets to
                which this website relates. Such successor entity shall be bound by the terms and
                conditions of this Privacy Policy.

        <h2>Use of Cookies</h2><br>
        <span class="bullet01">
        <ul>
            <li>We use "cookies" to help personalize and maximize your online experience and time
                online. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by a web page
                server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
                Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a web server
                in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies
                is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is
                to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if
                you personalize website pages, or register for services, a cookie helps us to recall
                your specific information (such as user name, password and preferences). Because
                of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more
                personalized website experience. When you return to the website, the information
                you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that
                you customized. We also use cookies to track click streams and for load balancing.
                You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically
                accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline all cookies
                if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting to
                notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies
                on an individual basis. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder
                performance and negatively impact your experience on this website. </li>
        </ul></span><br>
        
        <h2>Use of Web Beacons</h2><br>
        <span class="bullet01">
        <ul>
            <li>This website may contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called
                single-pixel gifs) that allow us to count users who have visited those pages and
                to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally
                identifiable information; they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics
                about our website usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including
                a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on
                which the Web beacon resides.
                <br>
                You may not decline web beacons, however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining
                all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is
                tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.
                <br>
                Third parties are not permitted to use Web beacons on this website. </li>
        </ul></span><br>
        
        <h2>Security</h2><br>
        <span class="bullet01">
        <ul>
            <li>We may employ procedural and technological measures, consistent with industry practice.
                Such measures are reasonably designed to help protect your personally identifiable
                information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.
                Company may use firewalls, internal restrictions, password protection, physical
                lock and key and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to
                your personally identifiable information.</li>
        </ul></span><br>
        
        <h2>Children</h2><br>

        <h2>Changes to Privacy Statement</h2><br>
        <span class="bullet01">
        <ul>
            <li>If we decide to materially change our Privacy Statement for this website, we will
                post those changes through a prominent notice on the web site so that you will always
                know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and to whom
                we will disclose it.
                <br>
                <br>
                If at any time, you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Statement or believe
                that we have not adhered to this Privacy Statement, please feel free to contact

                or resolve your problem. </li>
