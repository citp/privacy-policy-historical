JobCentral respects the privacy of every individual who visits our web site or interacts with us in any way. This Privacy Policy states how JobCentral will collect information and use it appropriately.</div>

<div class="sp15"><div></div></div><div class="c12 bld">Personal Information</div><div class="c12">There are several opportunities on our web site for you to provide us with personal information about you and your interests, such as name, mailing address and e-mail address.

JobCentral has a standard "<a href="terms.asp">Terms and Conditions of Service</a>" policy which governs the use of information, including resumes, obtained from the JobCentral site. Be aware that such "terms and conditions of use", although valid and enforceable, do not protect your resume from being collected and distributed in a manner you may not desire.</div>
