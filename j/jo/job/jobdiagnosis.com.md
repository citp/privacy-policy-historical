**BY REGISTERING WITH OR USING THE WEBSITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.**

As used in this Privacy Policy, “Non-Personally-Identifying Information” is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person. “Personally-Identifying Information,” by contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly associated with a specific person.

**COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION**

**_Website Registration_**

As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is information that can be directly associated with a specific person. We collect a range of Personally-Identifying Information from and about Website users. Much of the Personally-Identifying Information collected by us about users is information provided by users themselves at the time they sign up to use the Company Services. That information may include each user’s name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.  We also may request information about your interests and activities, your gender, hometown and other demographic information or your username, and other relevant information as determined by us from time to time. Users of the Website are under no obligation to provide us with Personally-Identifying Information of any kind, with the caveat that a user’s refusal to do so may prevent the user from using certain Website features.  **By providing a telephone number users agree and specifically thereby request that we, our partners, associates and/or certain approved third parties may contact you via such telephone number whether or not such number may be included in any State, Federal or other Do Not Call Registry.**

During the registration process you will be directed through a number of third party websites displaying advertisements for that may be of interest to you. If you select "Yes" on any of these advertisements or choose to complete the forms provided, you will be asked to submit Personally-Identifying Information. In all cases, when you click on the submit button we will securely transfer your personal information to the third-party advertiser you selected. We will not use the information that you submit for transfer to a third-party advertiser for our own purposes; nor will we retain or disclose it. You may be prompted by some advertisers to answer additional questions. These pages may be "co-branded" or "framed." This means that they may appear to be part of our Website because they have a JobDiagnosis.com look and feel, but they are, in fact, part of the advertiser's site.

All framed pages contain the following disclaimer at the bottom of the page: "*By submitting the form above I agree to provide this information to the advertiser and to be contacted by this advertiser directly." On these framed pages, we do not collect any of the additional information you submit; the advertiser does, and it does not share this information with us. The advertiser uses your information to deliver additional information to you about its particular product or service and perhaps for other purposes. Its collection and use of your information is subject to its own privacy policy.
