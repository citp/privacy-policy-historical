For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name, but not the e-mail address.

We collect only the domain name, but not the e-mail address of visitors to our Web page, as well as aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit.

**With respect to cookies:** JobStar does not set any cookies.

**With respect to Ad Servers:** We do use third party advertisements on JobStar to support the site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing Los Angeles job search ads to someone in Los Angeles, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites.)
