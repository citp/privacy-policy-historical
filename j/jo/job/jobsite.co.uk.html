          CV as a very personal document and we wish you to have full control 
          over who can view it and whether or not you wish to have your contact 
          details (name, address, telephone number, email address etc) visible

          a number of international recruitment websites, we give you the option 
          of putting your CV in our searchable database which is a significant 
          aid to quickly finding employment. We provide you a choice in how you 
          do this. The choice allows you to select the level of confidentiality

          is provided to you by your choice of whether to make your CV searchable 
          by our Clients or not. Making your CV searchable considerably increases 
          your exposure to potential employers. To prevent your CV from being 
          searched and viewed by our Clients you should choose to "hide" 
          your CV during the registration process. Choosing "hide" means 
          that your CV is not accessible by any recruiter but you can gain access 
          to it and use it when applying for individual jobs.<br>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">We use our best

          these terms and conditions, then we will immediately terminate their 
          use of our services. A link to our client terms and conditions may be 
          found at the bottom of this page. <br>
          You may remove your CV from our searchable database at any time. However, 
          recruiters who have paid for access to the database may have retained 
          a copy of your CV in their own files or databases. We are not responsible 
          for the retention, use, or privacy of your CV by recruiters in these
