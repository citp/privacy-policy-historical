		</p>
	  	<p>
			A Privacy Officer, who is responsible for all matters pertaining to privacy, has been appointed at jobsjobsjobs Limited
			and this person’s contact details are provided in this Privacy Charter under the heading
			<a href="#PrivacyOfficer">‘Privacy Officer’</a>, below.
		</p>

	  	<h3>Your Acceptance </h3>

			This Privacy Charter applies to and should be read in conjunction with the <a href="/Terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a>
			which are available on the Site.&nbsp; You can also request a copy from jobsjobsjobs Limited by writing to the privacy officer.

			in products and services and to offer them additional or related products and services.

		</p>

		<h3>Types of Personal Information We Collect</h3>
		<p>
			Generally, we collect personal information that is needed to facilitate and to provide the services and products offered
			to you via our Site.
		</p>
		<p>
			The types of personal information that we collect from you will depend on –
		</p>
		<p>(a) the circumstances of collection; and </p>
		<p>(b) the type of service you request from us.</p>
		<p>
			For example, when you register with us, we may collect details such as your name, address, telephone numbers and other
			relevant information. We generally do not collect “sensitive information” (as this term is defined in the
			<i>Privacy Act 1988</i> (Cth), which includes information relating to ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs,
			membership of a political or trade association, sexual preferences or health) and would not do so without your consent.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, there may be instances where such information becomes necessary or is part of a curriculum vitae. &nbsp;In such
			an event, the law requires us to obtain your consent to the collection of “sensitive information”. If you
			provide us with this information, we will assume that you have consented to the collection of that information for use in
			accordance with this Privacy Charter unless you expressly inform us otherwise.&nbsp; Please note that if you choose not to
			privide us with this information, this may impact on our ability to provide our products and services to you.
		</p>

		<h3>When we collect your personal information</h3>
		<p>
			We collect personal information at the time you make an enquiry or purchase with us.&nbsp; We only require information
			necessary to complete the transaction or for you to undertake a relevant search or job application.
		</p>

		<h3><strong>Why We Collect Personal Information</strong></h3>

		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>    to carry out transactions you wish to make;</li>
			<li>    to provide or facilitate the provision of requested products and services;</li>
			<li>    to collect payment for the products and services you purchase;</li>
			<li>    for our research and development purposes;</li>
			<li>    for training, quality control and verification purposes;</li>
			<li>    to communicate our, a related company’s, or a third party’s marketing offers to you; and</li>
			<li>    to meet our legal obligations.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>

		<h3><strong>How We Collect Personal Information</strong> </h3>
		<p>
			Generally, we will collect personal information directly from you, either in person, by telephone, letter, facsimile,
			email, or when you visit our Site. We may also request information from you when you purchase or make enquiries about
			our products or services, when you register for promotions or when you request brochures or other information. We may
			also collect information when we invite you to complete surveys or provide us with feedback.
		</p>
		<p>
			There may be circumstances where we collect information about you from third parties. For example, we may obtain
			information from market research companies, contracted by us to obtain information so that we may improve and market
			our products and services.
		</p>

		<h3><strong>How We Store information</strong></h3>
		<p>
			We store personal information in a combination of secure computer storage facilities and paper based files and other records.
			We have implemented systems and processes to protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss and unauthorised access,
			modification or disclosure. We use generally accepted technology and security measures so your information will be transmitted
			safely to us through the internet or other electronic means.&nbsp; When we no longer require your personal information, we will
			take reasonable steps to securely destroy or permanently de–identify it.
		</p>

		<h3><strong>How We Use Your Personal Information</strong> </h3>
		<p>
			Once you have provided us with your personal information, we use it for the purposes for which it was collected. Generally,
			this will involve the use of your personal information by us to deliver products and services that you have requested and to
			process transactions you conduct on our Site.&nbsp; Other ways in which we may use your personal information follow –
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>    to conduct marketing activities and to conduct market research (where you have consented to this use at the time of providing your information to us);</li>

			<li>    for regulatory or compliance purposes;</li>
			<li>    to service our relationship with you; and</li>
			<li>    for internal accounting and administration.</li>
		</ul>

			<li>    occasional updates about our products and services;</li>
			<li>    occasional marketing offers; and</li>
			<li>    regular scheduled email newsletters related to our products and services;</li>

			decline to receive email offers at any time by responding in the manner described in the email offer.&nbsp; However, if the

			or newsletters. These instructions are usually located at the bottom of the email message.
		</p>

		<h3><strong>Access &amp; Correction Of Information About You</strong></h3>
		<p>
			We will, upon a written request by you, provide you with access to the information we hold about you, unless there is an
			exception which applies under the National Privacy Principles which prevents us from providing you with that personal
			information.&nbsp; You are entitled to correct or update the information we hold about you.&nbsp; We may recover from you
			our reasonable costs of supplying you with access to the information that we hold about you.&nbsp; If you request that we provide
			you with access to your information that we hold about you, wwe will endeavour to provide that information to you within a reasonable
			time.&nbsp; If we refuse to provide you with access to the information, we will provide you with reasons for the refusal and inform
			you of any exceptions relied upon under the National Privacy Principles.
		</p>

		<h3><strong>Keeping Your Personal Information Up–to–Date</strong></h3>
		<p>
			We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete and
			up–to–date.&nbsp; If you are or become aware that the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, incomplete
			or out–of–date, please contact us and we will take all reasonable steps to correct this information.&nbsp; Also, if
			your personal details change, please correct your information online by logging in to your account and selecting “my profile”

		</p>

		<h3><strong>Disclosure of your personal information to third parties</strong></h3>
		<p>
			We may disclose your personal information to third parties in the following circumstances –
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>    if required to do so or permitted by law;</li>
			<li>    to various regulatory bodies and law enforcement officials and agencies to protect against fraud and for security purposes;</li>
			<li>    to our third party service providers as well as to our related entities, for the purposes of providing the services and/or products you request or purchase from us;</li>
		</ul>
		<br>

		<p>
			Where we engage third party contractors to perform services for us, those third party contractors may be given access to your personal
			information for the purposes of providing services to us.&nbsp; Under these circumstances however, those third party contractors must
			safeguard this information and must only use it for the purposes for which it was supplied.&nbsp; If we give a third party service
			provider your personal information, we will also make them aware of this Privacy Charter and ask that they handle your personal
			information in accordance with it.&nbsp; However, beyond this, we will not be liable if they do not comply with this Privacy Charter.
		</p>
		<p>
			Other than as described in this section, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent unless
		disclosure is&nbsp;–
		</p>
		<p>(a) necessary to prevent a threat to life or health;</p>
		<p>(b) reasonably necessary to enforce any matter; or</p>
		<p>(c) necessary to investigate a suspected unlawful activity</p>

		<h3><strong>Trans–Border Data Flows</strong></h3>
		<p>
			For the purposes of providing our services to you, it may be necessary for us to forward personal information to relevant overseas
			service providers.&nbsp; We will always ask for your consent at the time of collecting your personal information to allow us to
			provide your personal information to overseas entities for the purpose of providing our services to you.&nbsp; Please let us know
			if you have any objections to such transfers of information.&nbsp; However, we note that we may be not be able to provide you with
			the products and/or services requested if you object to such trans–border data flows.
		</p>


		<h3><strong>Links to other websites</strong></h3>
		<p>
			Our Site contains links to other websites.&nbsp; We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those other
			websites. You are responsible for reading the privacy statements and policies of any linked sites as their privacy policies may
			differ from ours.
		</p>

		<h3><strong>Security</strong> </h3>
		<p>
			We have adopted appropriate security features in order to protect and keep secure personal information from loss, misuse, alteration
			or destruction.&nbsp; We regularly review our security and encryption technologies and strive to protect personal information to the
			highest level possible.
		</p>

		<h3><strong>SSL </strong><strong>Technology</strong></h3>
		<p>
			We employ Secure Service Layer (SSL) Technology whenever any transaction is completed over our Site. Indeed, transactions involving
			the passage of personal information occur in one of our secure online areas only.&nbsp; SSL technology encrypts the information you
			send through our Site.&nbsp; The use of SSL technology requires two components –
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>An SSL–compatible browser; and</li>
			<li>A web server to perform “key–exchange” that establishes a secure connection.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>

		<p>
			For you to benefit from the SSL Technology which we have implemented:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>you will need a browser with SSL capabilities.&nbsp; The latest versions of commonly used web browsers generally have this
				capability.&nbsp; However, it is your responsibility to check that this is the case.&nbsp; If you do not already have a browser
				with SSL capabilities, you can download an SSL browser from a vendor's website.</li>
			<li>You will also need an internet service provider that enables SSL technology. Nearly all internet service providers automatically
				enable SSL technology, but you will need to ensure that this is the case with your service provider.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>

		<p>
			jobsjobsjobs Limited makes no warranty or representation in respect of the strength or effectiveness of the encryption capabilities
			of SSL Technology and jobsjobsjobs Limited is not responsible in any way for events arising from any unauthorised access of the
			information you provide.
		</p>

		<h3><strong>Tracking activity on our websites</strong></h3>
		<p>
			When you browse the Site and have not registered for any online products or services, you browse anonymously.&nbsp; Personally
			identifiable information – such as your name, address, telephone number and email address – is not collected as you
			browse.&nbsp; However, we track how our Site is used by both anonymous visitors and our registered customers, by using a small
			string of text that is sent to your browser known as a ‘cookie’. Our use of cookies is described in more detail in the
			next section.
		</p>


		<h3><strong>Cookies</strong></h3>
		<p>
			Cookies collect information that include the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type and how you gained entry to
			the Site.&nbsp; Therefore, when you visit the Site anonymously, details are recorded about your visit, such as how you have used
			the Site, the time and date of your access to the Site, pages of the Site that you accessed and the time you spent on the Site.
			&nbsp; This information is used in an anonymous form for statistical purposes and as such, cannot be used to identify you
			individually. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses or capture your email address
			or any other personally identifiable information.&nbsp; You should note that accepting cookies is required if you want to view
			our Site, because they are essential for our Site administration and security.
