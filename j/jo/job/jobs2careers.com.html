        These cookies contain no personally identifiable information. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us,
        e.g., your email address, that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form.

        <h4>Data Security</h4>
        <p>
        The security of your personal information is important to us.
        When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
        We use reasonable security measures and generally accepted standards to protect personal information from unauthorized use, alteration, and disclosure.
        We restrict access of your personal information from our employees, unless we believe it is reasonably necessary to do their jobs.
        No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
        Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
        If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@jobs2careers.com">privacy@jobs2careers.com</a>.
