Deleted records may still be stored by JOBBERMAN in testing or backup systems for a period of time.

All Registered Users have a personal JOBBERMAN Profile ('JOBBERMAN Profile') upon successful registration. A JOBBERMAN Profile can include a CV, personal information, employment and educational history, contact details, minimum salary expectations, skills, preferred job specializations and locations.

JOBBERMAN will not be held liable for any alternative use of such information by any individual or organization. User search activity is collected and analyzed and may be utilized by JOBBERMAN in the aggregate or in the abstract for a variety of business purposes.

This information may also be disclosed to JOBBERMAN's service providers and contractors from time to time who assist us to deliver our products and services.

By applying to a position advertised on JOBBERMAN you are requesting that JOBBERMAN pass the information to the relevant Advertiser. Any questions you have relating to a position advertised on JOBBERMAN, your online application and/or the status of your application should be directed to the Advertiser or their nominated agent, not JOBBERMAN. JOBBERMAN's role in the online application process is limited to forwarding your online application to the Advertiser, and storing it on their behalf (if requested to do so).
