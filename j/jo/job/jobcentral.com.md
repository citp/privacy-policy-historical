Neither JobCentral nor any other career site on the Internet can assure you that the information on your resume will not be collected and shared with others. JobCentral has a standard "[Terms and Conditions of Service](https://web.archive.org/web/20110922015551id_/http%3A//www.jobcentral.com/terms.asp "JobCentral Terms and Conditions of Service")" policy which governs the use of information, including resumes, obtained from the JobCentral site. Be aware that such "terms and conditions of use", although valid and enforceable, do not protect your resume from being collected and distributed in a manner you may not desire.
