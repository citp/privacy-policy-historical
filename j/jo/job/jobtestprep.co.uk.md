Cookies and other online tracking technologies are small bits of data or code that are used to identify your browser when you use and interact with our websites and other services. They are often used for remembering your preferences or to remember you’re logged in. Cookies do not contain information that is, in itself, personally identifying; they merely provide certain features, such as tracking sales performance of our affiliates and partners. All visitors are subject to cookies use on the JobTestPrep website by default.

**Tracking cookies:** When you visit our website we may collect tracking information, such as your browser type, the type of operating system you use, the name of your Internet service provider, and the pages you visited on the site.

These technologies (e.g. Google Analytics) allow us to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our website and to better tailor our website to your needs.

Information such as this will only be used in aggregate form and will not identify you personally.

**Functional/preference cookies and similar technologies:** These cookies collect information about your choices and preferences and allow us to remember things like your username to make the login process more convenient, and allow us to customise the services you have accessed.  

**Web beacons and tracking pixels:** These are bits of data that count the number of users who access a website or webpage and can also allow us to see if a cookie has been activated. Web beacons used on web pages or in emails allow us to see how successful a page has been, or whether an email message was successfully delivered and read in a marketing campaign.

**Test Practice Information**

Registered users who practice any test have a detailed log of their practice which includes:

  * Time Stamp of practice sessions
  * Number of tests viewed
  * Number of tests completed
  * Test score



This information is analysed for the purpose of providing customers with personalised recommendations for successful test preparation. For example, if the JobTestPrep experts see that a customer may have purchased the wrong product for their test, they may refer to the customers test practice information to see which tests the customer has been practicing with. If a customer reaches out for assistance, their previous test practice information enables our experts to give a personalised recommendation for further practice.

Additionally, test practice information may be anonymously collated and analysed to check which tests are required for specific assessments, test providers or institutes, for the purpose of making recommendations to other users.
