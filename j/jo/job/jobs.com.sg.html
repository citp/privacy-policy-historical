</p>
<p>
    Non-registered Users who gain access to the Websites via their accounts in online social networking tools (including but not limited to Facebook, Twitter

    networking tools may be obtained by the Publisher and be used by the Publisher and its authorized persons in and outside of the User's country for the
    purpose of providing services and marketing materials to the Users. The Publisher and its authorised personnel may gain access and use the personal data of

</p>
<p>
    <b> </b>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Security</b>
</p>
<p>
    The security of Users’ personal information and data is important to the Publisher. The Publisher will always strive to ensure that Users’ personal
    information and data will be protected against unauthorised access. The Publisher has implemented appropriate electronic and managerial measures in order
    to safeguard, protect and secure Users’ personal information and data.
</p>
<p>
    All personal information and data provided by Users are only accessible by the authorised personnel of the Publisher or its authorised third parties, and
    such personnel shall be instructed to observe the terms of this Privacy Statement when accessing such personal information and data. Users may rest assured
    that their personal information and data will only be kept for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it is collected. Registered User
    should safeguard his/her unique Username and Password by keeping it secret and confidential and never share these details with anyone.
</p>
<p>
    The Publisher follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information and data submitted by Users to the Websites, both during
    transmission and once the Publisher receives it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
    Therefore, while the Publisher strives to protect Users’ personal information and data against unauthorised access, the Publisher cannot guarantee its
    absolute security.
</p>
