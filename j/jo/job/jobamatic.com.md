We also use non-personally identifiable information and certain technical information about your computer and your access of the Sites (including your IP address) in order to operate, maintain and manage the Sites. We collect this information by automated means, such as cookies and web beacons, as described in more detail below.

If we seek to use the information we obtain about you in other ways, we will provide specific notice and request your consent at the time of collection.

## Information We Share

When you apply for a job through the Sites, employers will have access to information about you and your potential interest in employment opportunities. Those employers may use your information to contact you directly. Additionally, when you apply for a job through a link to a third party found on the Sites, the information supplied by you may be shared with Simply Hired by that third party and also may become part of the employer's database. In these instances, the use of such information by the employer will be subject to the privacy policy of that company, and we are not responsible for that company's use of your information.

The Sites may track the total number of visitors to our Sites, the number of visitors to each page of our Sites, IP addresses, External Web Sites linked to, search terms and the domain names of our users' Internet Service Providers, operating system and browser type, and we may analyze these data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information. We also may collect aggregate information such as demographics including age, occupation, gender, salary information and labor statistics. Such aggregate information may be collected from data that you have provided to us via usage of the Sites and/or public records, and is not unique to you nor is it linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Sites, track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may share this aggregate information with third parties, including our affiliated and parent companies, for various reasons related to our business to assist them in targeting advertisements to appropriate audiences.

Other than instances in which users opt to provide their Personal Information via a job application, include it in a job posting or otherwise provide permission to share it, we do not sell our users' Personal Information to anyone for any reason. When applying to jobs, our users decide for themselves how much contact information they wish to display.

We share Personal Information with our service providers, including our own affiliated companies and parent company, who help us in the delivery of our own products and services to you. These service providers may only use or disclose the information as necessary to perform services on our behalf or as otherwise required by law.

Simply Hired also may disclose specific user information when we determine, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement, to prevent a crime or protect national security, or to protect the interests or safety of Simply Hired or other users of the Sites. This means, for example, that Simply Hired may honor subpoenas, search warrants, law enforcement or court-mandated requests to reveal a user’s electronic address and identity, or other properly requested information.

Personal Information we have collected may be passed on to a third party in the event of a bankruptcy or another corporate reorganization of Simply Hired. In addition, if we are acquired by or merged with another company, or in the event of any sale of assets or other transfer of ownership by Simply Hired to a third party (whether by merger, sale or otherwise), or any other reorganization or joint venture, or assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any of Simply Hired’s business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding), the Personal Information we have collected may be transferred to such third party as well as such third party’s affiliates and subsidiaries, and may be used by such third party in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Please note that the Resume and Saved Jobs products are no longer available on the Sites. Any resume or job application you sent to an Employer via a job application may be kept by the Employer, and you should check such Employer’s privacy policy to understand how they keep your Personal Information.

You can direct questions regarding this Privacy Policy to Simply Hired by emailing us at: privacyoffice @ simplyhired.com (please remove spaces when sending email). Please include your name and email address in email requests.
