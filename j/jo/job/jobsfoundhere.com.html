This Privacy Policy outlines important information regarding the use and
disclosure of information collected via this Website.&nbsp; JobsFoundHere.com
provides this Privacy Policy to help users make an informed decision as to
whether to use or continue using the Website.<br>
<br>

PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME AND CHANGES ARE
EFFECTIVE UPON POSTING. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES AS IT IS YOUR
SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AWARE OF CHANGES. JobsFoundHere.com DOES NOT PROVIDE
NOTICES OF CHANGES IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN BY POSTING THE CHANGES AT THIS WEB
SITE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY PLEASE DO NOT
PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO JobsFoundHere.com OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS
OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEB SITES REFERRED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy applies to JobsFoundHere.com's collection, use, storage and
disclosure of information by JobsFoundHere.com on its (a) websites, including all its
divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the "Website"),
(b) on various third party websites, and (c) to JobsFoundHere.com's other information
collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. JobsFoundHere.com
 is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices
of third web sites or applications.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By reference, this Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to
the Website Terms of Use. Your use of the Website and any personal information
you provide via the Website or through other official JobsFoundHere.com contact
remains subject to this Privacy Policy, as well as the Terms of Use and/or
other stated policies.<br>
<br>
<b>1. Collection of Information.</b><br>
<b>1.1 Survey Information.</b><br>
JobsFoundHere.com collects information from individuals by various methods,
including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an JobsFoundHere.com
 survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or
by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages
operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online"
means using the Internet, including the Website, and related technologies, and
"offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the
postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the
Surveys, JobsFoundHere.com or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual
to provide various information to JobsFoundHere.com, which may include his or her
name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including
cell phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and
content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital
status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal
and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time
to time (together, "Survey Information"). JobsFoundHere.com may also collect
information concerning an individual from another source and use that
information in combination with information provided from this Web Site.
Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no
obligation to provide Survey Information to JobsFoundHere.com or Third Party, but an
individual may receive incentives from JobsFoundHere.com or a Third Party in exchange
for providing Survey Information to JobsFoundHere.com.<br>
<br>
<b>1.2 Third Party List Information.</b><br>

JobsFoundHere.com collects information from individuals when an individual provides
information to a Third Party and JobsFoundHere.com subsequently purchases, licenses,
or otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the "Seller"). Such
purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name,
email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell
phone numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content
of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital
status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and
such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller
(together, "Third Party List Information"). When acquiring Third Party List
Information, JobsFoundHere.com seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a
right to transfer the Third Party List Information to JobsFoundHere.com and that the
Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose
personal information is included on the Seller's list.<br>
<br>
<b>1.3 Other Information.</b><br>
Other occasions when JobsFoundHere.com obtains information from individuals include
(1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an
incentive offered by JobsFoundHere.com or by a Third Party, (2) when an individual
requests assistance through JobsFoundHere.com's customer service department, and (3)
when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a JobsFoundHere.com service or
newsletter (together, "Other Information").<br>
<br>
<b>1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</b><br>
JobsFoundHere.com currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate
certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about
the individual in our database. Additionally, JobsFoundHere.com may use other new and
evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology
Information").<br>
<b>(a) Cookies.&nbsp; </b>A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard
drive of the individual's computer that allows JobsFoundHere.com to identify the
individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in JobsFoundHere.com's
database. You may read more about cookies at <span style=""><u><span style="color: blue;">http://cookiecentral.com</span></u></span>. Individuals who
use the Website need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and
functionality of the Website.<br>

<b>(b) Web Beacons.&nbsp; </b>A web beacon is programming code that can be used
to display an image on a web page (by using an &lt;img src="x"&gt; programming
function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used
to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a
cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired
information about an individual in a database. This allows JobsFoundHere.com to track
certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to
determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track
online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, JobsFoundHere.com might
place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third
Party's website where baseball products are sold. When Joe, an individual
listed in JobsFoundHere.com's database, visits the fishing website, JobsFoundHere.com
receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the baseball site,
and JobsFoundHere.com would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe
is interested in baseball. JobsFoundHere.com may thereafter present offers of
baseball related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons
on web pages, JobsFoundHere.com also uses web beacons in email messages sent to
individuals listed in JobsFoundHere.com's database.<br>
<b>(c) New Technology.&nbsp; </b>The use of technology on the Internet,
including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is JobsFoundHere.com's use
of new and evolving technology. As a result, JobsFoundHere.com strongly encourages
individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of
technology.<br>
<br>
<b>1.5 Outside Information.</b><br>
JobsFoundHere.com may receive information about individuals from Third Parties or
from other sources of information outside of JobsFoundHere.com including information
located in public databases ("Outside Information").<br>
<br>

<b>1.6 Individual Information.</b><br>
As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party
List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside
Information, and any other information JobsFoundHere.com gathers or receives about
individuals such as usage data, file transfer and viewing data.<br>
<br>
<b>1.7 No Information Collected from Children.</b><br>
JobsFoundHere.com will never knowingly collect any personal information about
children under the age of 13. If JobsFoundHere.com obtains actual knowledge that it
has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that
information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not
collect such information, JobsFoundHere.com has no such information to use or to
disclose to Third Parties. JobsFoundHere.com has designed this policy in order to
comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").<o:p></o:p><p></p>
