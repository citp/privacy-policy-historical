# Privacy policy | JOB TODAY

## Please read this policy carefully before using JOBTODAY S.A.’s services.

Protecting your data, privacy and personal information is very important to JobToday S.A. **(“JOB TODAY”, “JobToday”, “our”, “us” or “we”)**.

This policy (together with our terms of use at [https://jobtoday.com/en/terms-and-conditions](https://web.archive.org/en/terms-and-conditions) and any other documents referred to in it), sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read this privacy policy carefully to understand the types of information we collect from you, how we use that information, the circumstances under which we will share it with third parties, and your rights in relation to the personal data you provide to us.

When visiting JobToday’s website at [https://jobtoday.com](https://jobtoday.com/) or any of its affiliated websites (our “ **Website** ”), using our application “JobToday” (our “ **App** ”) or using any of the services offered via the Website or the App (the “ **Services** ”), you acknowledge, and where applicable consent to, the practices described in this policy.

Our Services may contain links to third party services. If you click on a link to access any of those third-party services, please note that they have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for their policies or processing of your personal information. Please check these policies before you submit any personal information to such third-party websites.

Our Services connect you with Job Seekers, Jobs, or Employers (as applicable), giving you the ability to search for, browse, and communicate with Job Seekers, Jobs, or Employers (as applicable). However, we also use automated matching processes facilitated by algorithms within the Services which seek to match you with the most appropriate Job Seekers, Jobs, or Employers (as applicable) by reference to the data you have provided to us along with any criteria specified by the Job Seeker or Employer (as applicable). This may result in decisions being made automatically. For example, we may limit what jobs are visible to Job Seekers based on the qualifications and expertise required for that job. In relation to this automated processing, we ensure there are safeguards in place to protect your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests and you have the right to contest any automated decisions made and obtain human intervention to alter decisions made, where possible. We may also use non-algorithmic methods to match you with Job Seekers who we believe would be suitable candidates or Employers who we believe have a suitable role for you (as applicable). These will always be recommendations and we will not commence any job applications without your involvement and/or consent.

## Information we may collect

All information you provide to us is stored on our or our subcontractors’ secure servers and accessed and used subject to our security policies and standards.

We use hosted servers (such as Amazon Web Services) in the course of our business, including for the permission of marketing and sales activity. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential, ensuring it is secure and strong, and for complying with any other security procedures that we notify you of. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

## Exports outside the EEA

Your personal information may be accessed by staff or suppliers in, transferred to, and/or stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA) in which data protection laws may be of a lower standard than in the EEA. Regardless of location or whether the person is an employee or contractor, we will impose the same data protection safeguards that we deploy inside the EEA.

Certain countries outside the EEA have been approved by the European Commission as providing essentially equivalent protections to EEA data protection laws and therefore no additional safeguards are required to export personal information to these jurisdictions. In countries which have not had these approvals, we will either ask for your consent to the transfer or transfer it subject to European Commission approved contractual terms that impose equivalent data protection obligations directly on the recipient, unless we are permitted under applicable data protection law to make such transfers without such formalities.

Please contact us if you would like further details of the specific safeguards applied to the export of your personal data.

## How long we retain your personal data

Your personal information may be accessed by staff or suppliers in, transferred to, and/or stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA) in which data protection laws may be of a lower standard than in the EEA. Regardless of location or whether the person is an employee or contractor, we will impose the same data protection safeguards that we deploy inside the EEA.

Certain countries outside the EEA have been approved by the European Commission as providing essentially equivalent protections to EEA data protection laws and therefore no additional safeguards are required to export personal information to these jurisdictions. In countries which have not had these approvals, we will either ask for your consent to the transfer or transfer it subject to European Commission approved contractual terms that impose equivalent data protection obligations directly on the recipient, unless we are permitted under applicable data protection law to make such transfers without such formalities.

Please contact us if you would like further details of the specific safeguards applied to the export of your personal data.

## Your rights

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2017/676, you have various rights in relation to your personal data. All of these rights can be exercised by contacting us at [privacy@jobtoday.com](mailto:privacy@jobtoday.com).

In certain circumstances, you have the following rights in relation to your personal data:

Right of Access

You have the right to obtain from us information as to whether your personal data is being processed, and, where that is the case, access to such personal data.

Right to Rectification

We will use reasonable endeavours to ensure that your personal information is accurate. In order to assist us with this, you should notify us of any changes to the personal information that you have provided to us by sending us a request to rectify your personal data where you believe the personal data we have is inaccurate or incomplete. You may also change most of your personal details within our app directly.

Right to erasure / ‘Right to be forgotten’

Asking us to delete all of your personal data will result in JobToday deleting your personal data without undue delay (unless there is a legitimate and legal reason why JobToday is unable to delete certain of your personal data, in which case we will inform you of this in writing).

Right to restriction of processing

You have the right to ask us to stop processing your personal data at any time.

Right to data portability

You have the right to request that JobToday provides you with a copy of all of your personal data and to transmit your personal data to another data controller in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, where it is technically feasible for us to do so and the processing is based on consent or contractual performance.

Right to complain

You have the right to lodge a complaint to a supervisory authority such as the Information Commissioner’s Office in Luxembourg  (seehttps://cnpd.public.lu/en.html). Although we encourage our customers to engage with us in the event they have any concerns or complaints.

JobToday will not ordinarily charge you in respect of any requests we receive to exercise any of your rights detailed above; however, if you make excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded requests, we may charge you an administration fee in order to process such requests or refuse to act on such requests. Where we are required to provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing this will be free of charge; however, any further copies requested may be subject to reasonable fees based on administrative costs.   Asking us to stop processing your personal data or deleting your personal data will likely mean that you are no longer able to use JobToday’s Services, or at least those aspects of the Services which require the processing of the types of personal data you have asked us to delete, which may result in you no longer being able to use the Services. Where you request JobToday to rectify or erase your personal data or restrict any processing of such personal data, JobToday may notify third parties to whom such personal data has been disclosed of such request. However, such third party may have the right to retain and continue to process such personal data in its own right.

## Changes to this policy

Any changes we make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page, and where appropriate, notified to you by email. We therefore encourage you to review it from time to time to stay informed of how we are processing your information.
