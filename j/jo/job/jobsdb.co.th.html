The Company generally uses such automatically collected information and data to estimate the audience size of the Website, gauge the popularity of various parts of the Website, track users' movements and number of entries in the Company's promotional activities, measure users' traffic patterns and administer the Website. Such automatically collected information and data will not be disclosed save and except in accordance with the section entitled "Disclosure or Transfer of Data".</p>
  
  <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
  <p align="justify">The Website may provide links to other websites which are not owned or controlled by the Company. Personal information and data from users may be collected by third parties on these other websites when users visit such websites and make use of the services provided therein. Where and when users decide to click on any advertisement or hyperlink on the Website which grants users access to another website, the users' personal information and data which are deemed to be private and confidential may be exposed in these other websites.</p>
  <p align="justify">This Statement is only applicable to the Website.
