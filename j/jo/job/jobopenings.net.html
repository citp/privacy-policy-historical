  <hr>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The <strong>Job Openings.net</strong><strong> (JO)</strong>
  has adopted a set of information management guidelines which serve as the basis for our
  customer and advertiser relationships. These guidelines have been developed with the
  recognition that Internet technologies are rapidly evolving, and that underlying business
  models are still not established. Accordingly, guidelines are subject to change. Any such
  changes will be posted on this page. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>1. What information does The Job Openings.net gather/track about you?</b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>JO</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2"> requires that job applicants and others supply
  personal information, including e-mail address, during a "registration" process
  prior to using some portions of the site and to add a listing to the site. (Some
  of the personal information we request is voluntary; the word "not required" appears next to these questions.) On occasion, <strong>JO</strong> also collects
  additional personal information from subscribers in optional contest and survey forms.
  Demographic information provided by a subscriber may be combined with site usage reports
  to profile, in aggregate form, users and their preferences in site content and
  advertising. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>JO</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2"> also logs IP addresses, or the
  location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting
  purposes. We do not log IP addresses to track a user's session, nor do we link IP
  addresses to anything personally identifiable. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>2. What does The Job Openings.net do
  with the information it gathers/tracks?</b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>JO</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2"> may perform statistical analyses of
  user behavior in order to measure relative consumer interest in the various areas of our
  site (for service development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many consumers
  have seen their advertising banners. In performance of these statistical
  analyses, we will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form. Personal
  information on individual subscribers will not be provided to any third party except for Job Openings.net sponsors and partners as needed to help applicants in job searches. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Using the e-mail addresses provided at registration, <strong>JO</strong> periodically sends promotional e-mail to its subscribers about services offered by <strong>JO</strong> and its advertisers. A user can indicate on the subscriber registration form that he
  or she does not wish to receive e-mail information from <strong>JO</strong> or its
  advertisers. <strong>JO</strong> may contact a subscriber regarding account status or
  changes to the subscriber agreement. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>3. With whom does The Job Openings.net share the information it gathers/tracks?</b> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>JO</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2"> shares the information it tracks, in
  aggregate form, with advertisers and other partners. We do not sell or share
  email addresses with third parties or advertisers except for partners or site sponsors.&nbsp; <strong>JO</strong> will provide a subscriber a summary of his or her personal information provided at
  registration upon request. This information will only be sent to the e-mail address on
  file for the subscriber name associated with it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Upon request, <strong>JO</strong> will remove any
  subscriber or job applicant (and his or her personal information) from our database, or allow any
  subscriber to "opt out" of further contact (while still allowing access to the
  site) or change/correct personal information that the subscriber states is erroneous. To
  obtain an information summary or request a change of information, send e-mail to
  <a href="http://www.123call.Us/">Customer Service</a>. </font></p>
