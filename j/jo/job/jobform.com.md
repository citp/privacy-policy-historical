**The Protection of your CV**

Your CV is regarded as a very personal document and you have full control over who can view it.

You may remove your c.v. from our searchable database at any time, however, recruiters who have paid for access to the database may have retained a copy of your c.v. in their own files or database. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of your c.v. by recruiters in these instances.

Please note that hotonline reserves the right to remove from our database any c.v. which includes content that we consider to be illegal, offensive or inaccurate.

If you do not wish to make your c.v. searchable, you should elect to “keep my c.v. private” at the time of registration. This will ensure that your c.v. is not accessible by any recruiter but you can gain access to it and use it for job applications. You can make your c.v. searchable at any time. 

We use our best endeavours to limit access to our c.v. service to recruiters who agree to abide by our terms and conditions. Should any recruiter be found to be in breach of these terms, we will immediately terminate this use of our services. 

Your current employer may be a customer of hotonline or be a client of one of our customers. We cannot restrict the customers who access profiles on our database and cannot be held responsible for any eventuality. As part of the registration process you can elect to keep your c.v. private.
