      Monster   Worldwide, Inc., Monster, Inc., Webneuron Services Limited (a   company owned by Monster Worldwide) and Monster Technologies,   LLC, are committed to respecting the privacy of our users. We   strive to provide a safe, secure user experience. This Privacy   Statement sets forth the online data collection and usage policies   and practices that apply to <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>.com (sometimes referred   to herein as the "Site") and does not apply to information   we collect in any other fashion.<br>
      <br>
      Your   data will be stored and processed in whole or in part in the   United States and India. The information we gather on <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>.com   may be shared within the Monster-affiliated companies on a worldwide   basis in order to deliver the products and services we offer   to employers such as searches for job seekers or in order to   undertake analysis of our database such as aggregate profiling   of our registered users. "Affiliated companies" means   entities that control, are controlled by or are under common   control with Monster, Inc.<br>

      <br>
      <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>.com   may contain links to other Web sites over which we have no control.   We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices   of other Web sites to which you choose to link from our Site.   We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other   Web sites so you can understand how they collect, use and share   your information.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class="heading7">2. Collection and Use of Information by <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_text">Ahead</span></span><br>
      In   some areas of <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>.com, we request or may request that   you provide personal information, including your name, address,   e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, contact   information, billing information and any other information from   which your identity is discernible. In other areas, we collect   or may collect demographic information that is not unique to   you such as your PIN code, age, preferences, gender, interests   and favorites. Sometimes we collect or may collect a combination   of the two types of information. Examples of areas on the Site   where we collect personal or combined personal and demographic   data are pages where you can open a My <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> account, sign   up to use a service, post a resume, enter a contest or purchase   a product. In addition, we may indirectly collect information   about you when you use certain third party services available   on <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>. For example, if you register on <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> by using   your Microsoft Passport user name and password, you authorize   us to have access to and store the information in your Passport   account profile; such information will be subject to, and treated   in accordance with, the policies and practices described in   this Privacy Statement.<br>

      <br>
      We   also gather or may gather certain information about your use   of <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>, such as what areas you visit and what services you   access. Moreover, there is information about your computer hardware   and software that is or may be collected by us. This information   can include without limitation your IP address, browser type,   domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses,   but is not linked to your personal information.<br>
      <br>
      We may sometimes afford you the opportunity to provide descriptive,   cultural, behavioral, preferential and/or life style information   about yourself, but it is solely up to you whether you furnish   such information. If you do provide such information, you are   thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance   with the policies and practices described in this Privacy Statement.   For example, such information may be used for the purpose of   determining your potential interest in receiving e-mail or other   communications about particular products or services.<br>
      <br>
      If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>.com or other Monster Sites or refer a job posting   to a friend, we will ask you for your friend's name and email   address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email   inviting him or her to visit the Site(s) or view the job posting.   We do not store this information.<br>

      <br>
      <br>
      <span class="heading7">3.   Our Use of Your Information</span><br>
      We   use the information we gather on <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>.com, whether personal,   demographic, collective or technical, for the purpose of operating   and improving the Site, fostering a positive user experience,   and delivering the products and services that we offer.<br>
      <br>
      If   you have provided consent for us to do so, we may also use the   information we gather to inform you of other products or services   available from us or our affiliated companies or to contact   you about your opinion of current products and services or potential   new products and services that may be offered.<br>

      We may use your contact information in order to send you e-mail   or other communications regarding updates at the Site, and if   you have requested, information on new opportunities and additional   job postings which may be of interest to you. The nature and   frequency of these messages will vary depending upon the information   we have about you.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, at the time of registration for a My <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> account, you have the option to elect or not elect to receive   additional communications, information and promotions, including   without limitation, free informational newsletters from us relating   to topics that may be of special interest to you, such as career   management advice. <br>
      <br>
      We have areas on the <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> Site where you can submit feedback.   Any feedback you submit in these areas becomes our property,   and we can use such feedback (such as success stories) for marketing   purposes or to contact you for further information.<br>

      <br>
      <br>
      <span class="heading7">4.   Choices Regarding the Disclosure of Personal Information to   Others </span><br>
      We   do not disclose your personal information to third parties,   or your combined personal and demographic information or information   about your use of <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> (such as the areas you visit or the   services you access), except as set forth below.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> We   disclose information to third parties if you consent to such   disclosure. For example, if you indicate that you would like   to receive information about the opportunities, products or   services of third parties at the time you register for a My <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> account, we supply your contact information to third   parties such as employers, recruiters, data aggregators, marketers   or others for the purpose of sending you e-mail or otherwise   communicating with you. We use data we have about you (such   as the interests and preferences you have expressed) to determine   whether you might be interested in the opportunities, products   or services of a particular third-party. </li>

          <li> We disclose information to companies and individuals we employ   to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include hosting   our Web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance,   processing credit card payments, and providing customer service.   These companies and individuals will have access to your personal   information as necessary to perform their functions, but they   may not share that information with any other third party. </li>
          <li> We disclose information if legally required to do so, if requested   to do so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good   faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal   requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our   rights or property or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent   a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal   safety of users or the public. </li>
          <li> We disclose and transfer information to a third party who   acquires all or a substantial portion of our business, whether   such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase   of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition,   in the event we become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding,   whether voluntary or involuntary, we or our trustee in bankruptcy   may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information   in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court. You will   be notified of sale of all or a substantial portion of our   business to a third party via email or through a prominent   notice posted on the <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> Site. </li>
        </ul>

      <span class="heading7">5.   Other Uses of Information</span><br>
      We   also share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to   <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> (for example, the number of visitors to <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>'s job   search area) with its clients, partners and other third parties   so that they can understand the kinds of visitors to the <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>   Site and how those visitors use the <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> Site.<br>

      <br>
      We supply technology, hosting and related services to other leading   companies to power recruitment areas on their Web sites (sometimes   referred to as "Hosted Career Sites"). Personal and/or   demographic information supplied by you in Hosted Career Sites   becomes part of the Monster database, but it is not accessible   by anyone other than you, Monster and the company concerned without   your consent.<br>
      <br>
      Information gathered on a page in a Hosted Career Site or on a   co-branded page (such as that of a contest co-sponsored by <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> and another company), may become the property of the other company   or of both us and the other company. In that instance, the use   of such information by the other company will be subject to the   privacy policy of that company. We are not responsible for that   company's use of your personal or demographic information.<br>
      <br>

      If you apply for a position on <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> or through a Hosted Career   Site, you may be asked to provide information on your gender,   race or other protected status where permitted by applicable law.   Some employers are required by law to gather this information   from job applicants for reporting and record-keeping requirements.   You should understand that if provided, this information will   be used by employers only in accordance with applicable law and   will not be used in making any negative employment decisions.   All information provided will be kept separate from your expression   of interest in any job opportunity. Providing this information   is strictly voluntary and you will not be subject to any adverse   action or treatment if you choose not to provide this information.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class="heading7">6.   Personal Information on Resumes and Profiles<br>
      </span>Since <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> is a career site, we give you three options regarding the   accessibility of your resume:
      <ol><li>You can store your resume in our database, but not allow it to be searchable by potential employers. Not allowing your resume to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a job online, but employers and recruiters will not have access to search it through our resume database product.<br>

          <br>
        <br></li>
        <li>	 If you allow your resume to be searchable without making it confidential and hiding your contact information, then all parties with access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> If you have a confidential resume, but apply to a job posting on   <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>, the employer to whom you send your resume will be able to   view your contact information.</li>

      </ol>
      We attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database (or copies   thereof) only to paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, and human   resource professionals, as well as law enforcement and national security   agencies, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to   this database. We are not responsible for the use made of resumes by third   parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database.   You may remove your resume on <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> at anytime, but, employers, recruiters   and others who have paid for access to the <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> resume database or to   obtain a copy of that database as well as parties who have otherwise gained   access may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases.   We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of resumes or profiles   in these instances.<br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <span class="heading7">7.   Posting to Public Areas of JobsAhead </span><br>
      Please   remember that if you post any of your personal information   in public areas of <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> such as in online forums or chat   rooms, or in the <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> searchable resume database, such   information may be collected and used by others over whom   we have no control. We are not responsible for the use made   by third parties of information you post or otherwise make   available in public areas of <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>.<br>

      <br>
      <br>
      <span class="heading7">8.   Use of Cookies</span><br>
      We   use "cookies" to help personalize and maximize   your online experience and time online. A cookie is a text   file that is placed on your hard drive by a Web page server.   Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses   to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your   computer, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain   that issued the cookie to you.<br>
      <br>
      One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience   feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to   tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific   page. For example, if you personalize <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> pages, or   register for services, a cookie helps us to recall your   specific information (such as user name, password and preferences).   Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and   more accurate results and a more personalized site experience.   When you return to <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>, the information you previously   provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features   that you customized. We also use cookies to track click   streams and for load balancing.<br>

      <br>
      You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most   Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually   modify your browser setting to decline all cookies if you   prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser   setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and   permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual   basis. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may   hinder performance and negatively impact your experience   on <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class="heading7"> 9.   Use of Web Beacons</span><br>
      <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>   Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons   (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) that allow us to   count users who have visited those pages and to deliver   co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access   your personally identifiable information; they are a technique   we use to compile aggregated statistics about our Web   site usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of   information including a cookie number, time and date of   a page view, and a description of the page on which the   Web beacon resides. <br>

      <br>
      You may not decline web beacons, however, they can be   rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or modifying   your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie   is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies   on an individual basis.<br>
      Third parties are not permitted to use Web beacons on   the <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> Site.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class="heading7">10.   Access to and Modification of Your Information</span><br>

      You   may review, correct, update or change your My <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> account information at any time.<br>

      <br>
      If you opted to receive newsletters, commercial e-mails   or other communications from <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> or third parties   at the time you created a My <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> account, but   subsequently changed your mind, you may opt-out by editing   My <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> Account Profile as described above. If   you previously opted not to receive such communications,   you may later opt-in by editing My <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> Account   Profile as well.<br>

      <br>
      We retain indefinitely all the information we gather   about you in an effort to make your repeat use of <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> more efficient, practical, and relevant. Of course,   you can delete your resume from <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>'s online database,   close My <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> account at any time in which event   we will remove all our copies of your resume from <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>,   My <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> account information except for an archival   copy which is not accessible on the Internet. <br>

      <br>
      <br>
      <span class="heading7">11.   Security of the Personal Information</span><br>
      We   have implemented commercially reasonable technical   and organizational measures designed to secure your   personal information from accidental loss and from   unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure.   However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third   parties will never be able to defeat those measures   or use your personal information for improper purposes.<br>
      <br>
      When you place an order online at <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> your credit   card information is protected through the use of encryption,   such as the Secure Socket Layer ("SSL")   protocol. SSL makes it difficult for your credit card   information to be intercepted or stolen while being   transmitted. We use a service company to process its   credit card transactions. For further information   on this company's privacy and security practices,   please <a href="http://www.fabmall.com/HTML/safe_secure.asp">click here.</a> <br>

      <span class="heading7"> 12.   Children</span><br>
      <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> and the other Monster Sites are not intended for   children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly   collect personal information from children under   13.<br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <span class="heading7">13.   Safe Harbor</span><br>
      We   participate in the Department of Commerce's Safe   Harbor Framework arising out of the U.S. implementation   of the European Union Data Protection Directive.   We have certified adherence to the Safe Harbor   Privacy Principles for each of the Monster Sites.
