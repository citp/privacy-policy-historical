        <span class="heading7">2. Collection and Use of Information by <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_text">Ahead</span></span><br>
        <br>
        <strong class="td_green">Information We Collect  and Retain</strong><br>
You do not have to give us any personal information in order to perform job  searches or to read the content portions of our Site. We collect the following  general types of information about you when you visit our Sites: personal  information, demographic information, behavioral information, and indirect  information. Sometimes we collect combinations of all these types of  information. In each case, it is indicated on the web site whether any personal  or demographic data must be provided to use the requested service or not.<br>

<br>
<em>Personal information</em> is  information that can be used to identify you, or any other individual to whom  the information may relate, personally. We do not collect personal information  unless you choose to provide it to us. Some examples of personal information  that we collect in some areas of our Site, depending on the services you use  and local law, are: </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Your name </li>
        <li>Address </li>
        <li>Email address </li>
        <li>Telephone number </li>

        <li>Contact       information </li>
        <li>Billing       information </li>
        <li>Information       about third parties, such as references or contacts, that you provide to       us if you have their express written consent to do so </li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Demographic information</em> is  information that is not unique to you in the sense that it refers to selected  population characteristics, such as your ZIP code or postal code, age,  preferences, gender, race or ethnicity, occupation, career history, interests  and favorites.<br>
        <br>

        We also collect <em>behavioral information </em>regarding  how you use our site and mobile applications, the areas of our site that you  visit, what services you access, and information about your computer hardware  and software including your IP address, geolocation, browser and operating  system type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. This  information is necessary for analyzing the use of resources, troubleshooting  problems, preventing fraud, and improving our services.<br>
  <br>
        In addition, &nbsp;<span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> may  collect <em>indirect information</em> about  you when you use certain third party services on our web site and the  collection of such information is considered necessary for that purpose.<br>

  <br>
        We do not collect sensitive personal data or information of users like password  of your e mail account; password of your <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> account (as it automatically get saved in the &nbsp;<span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>server&nbsp; when you create an account or register with <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> and not  authorized by &nbsp;<span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> for  access unless desired under any legal obligation); financial information such  as Bank Account details or Credit Card or Debit Card or other payment related  details; physical and mental or other health conditions or medical records and  history; Biometric information such as finger prints, voice &amp; facial  patterns and DNA any other sensitive information which is confidential or  sensitive by its nature.<br>

  <br>
      We may personalize the advertising that you are shown on our sites or other  sites with which we have a business relationship. In order to provide this  personalization, in addition to information we collect about you on our sites,  we acquire information (including personal, demographic, behavioral and  indirect information) about you from third parties who provide it to us.</p>
In some areas of <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>.com, we request or may  request that you provide personal information, including your name, address,  e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, contact information,  billing information and any other information from which your identity is discernible.  In other areas, we collect or may collect demographic information that is not  unique to you such as your PIN code, age, preferences, gender, interests and  favorites. Sometimes we collect or may collect a combination of the two types  of information. Examples of areas on the Site where we collect personal or  combined personal and demographic data are pages where you can open a My <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> account, sign up to use a  service, post a resume, enter a contest or purchase a product. In addition, we  may indirectly collect information about you when you use certain third party  services available on <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>.  For example, if you register on <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> by  using your Microsoft Passport user name and password, you authorize us to have  access to and store the information in your Passport account profile; such  information will be subject to, and treated in accordance with, the policies  and practices described in this Privacy Statement.<br>

<br>
We also gather or may gather certain information about your use of <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>.com, such as what areas  you visit and what services you access. Moreover, there is information about  your computer hardware and software that is or may be collected by us. This  information can include without limitation your IP address, browser type,  domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses, but is not linked  to your personal information.<br>
<br>
We may sometimes afford you the opportunity to provide descriptive, cultural,  behavioral, preferential and/or life style information about yourself, but it is  solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such  information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in  accordance with the policies and practices described in this Privacy Statement.  For example, such information may be used for the purpose of determining your  potential interest in receiving e-mail or other communications about particular  products or services.<br>
<br>
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>.com or other Monster Sites  or refer a job posting to a friend, we will ask you for your friend's name and  email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting  him or her to visit the Site(s) or view the job posting. We do not store this  information.<br>
<br>
<br>

  <span class="heading7">3.   Our Use of Your Information</span><br>We use the  information we gather on <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>.com,  whether personal, demographic, collective or technical, for the purpose of  operating and improving the Site, fostering a positive user experience, and  delivering the products and services that we offer.<br>
    <br>
    If you have provided consent for us to do so, we may also use the information  we gather to inform you of other products or services available from us or our  affiliated companies or to contact you about your opinion of current products  and services or potential new products and services that may be offered.<br>
    We may use your contact information in order to send you e-mail or other  communications regarding updates at the Site, and if you have requested,  information on new opportunities and additional job postings which may be of  interest to you. The nature and frequency of these messages will vary depending  upon the information we have about you.<br>
  <br>

    We have areas on the Site where you can submit feedback. Any feedback you  submit in these areas becomes our property, and we can use such feedback (such  as success stories) for marketing purposes or to contact you for further  information.<br>
    <span class="td_green"><br>

    <li>to enable you to       provide feedback, to contact us and for us to respond to you; </li>
    <li>to conduct       surveys, questionnaires, promotions and contests, and to provide the       results thereof such as success stories and contest winners; </li>

    <li>to provide       ‘forward to a friend’ features. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some of our products and services, such as our searchable resume  database and networking, enable third parties to see your personal information  and to contact you. Profile information may be used for networking with other  community members or may be visible to employers who are using the Sites. In  addition, portions of your searchable resume (but not your contact information)  may be made public in your networking profile.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Information you post in public areas of the site  or place in the searchable resume database will be accessed, used, and stored  by others around the world, including those in countries that might not have  legislation that guarantees adequate protection of personal information as  defined by your country of residence.</strong> By providing your personal  information for inclusion in our database, you acknowledge that you consent to  your information being used as described here. While Monster takes measures to  safeguard your information from unauthorized access or inappropriate use by  third parties, Monster does not control these third parties and we are not  responsible for their use of information you post or otherwise make available  in public areas of the <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> Sites. Accordingly, you should ensure that you do not post  sensitive information, including personality profiles, to any <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> Site.</p>

  <br>
  <span class="heading7">4.   Choices Regarding the Disclosure of Personal Information to   Others </span><br>We  do not disclose your personal information to third parties, or your combined  personal and demographic information or information about your use of <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> (such as the areas  you visit or the services you access), except as set forth below.
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>We disclose       information to third parties if you consent to such disclosure. For       example, if you indicate that you would like to receive information about       the opportunities, products or services of third parties at the time you       register for a My <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> account, we supply your contact       information to third parties such as employers, recruiters, data       aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you e-mail or       otherwise communicating with you. We use data we have about you (such as       the interests and preferences you have expressed) to determine whether you       might be interested in the opportunities, products or services of a       particular third-party. </li>

        <li>We disclose       information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions on       our behalf. Examples include hosting our Web servers, analyzing data,       providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and       providing customer service. These companies and individuals will have access       to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but       they may not share that information with any other third party. </li>
        <li>We disclose       information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a       governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is       necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal       process; (b) protect our rights or property or our affiliated companies;       (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal       safety of users or the public. </li>
        <li>We disclose and       transfer information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial       portion of our business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger,       consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets.       In addition, in the event we become the subject of a bankruptcy       proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, we or our trustee in       bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a       transaction approved by the bankruptcy court. You will be notified of sale       of all or a substantial portion of our business to a third party via email       or through a prominent notice posted on the JobsAhead Sites. </li>
      </ul>
<span class="heading7">5.   Other Uses of Information</span><br>
We also share aggregated anonymous information  about visitors to <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> (for example, the number of visitors to <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>'s job search area) with its clients, partners  and other third parties so that they can understand the kinds of visitors to  the Site and other Monster Sites and how those visitors use the said Sites.<br>

<br>
We supply technology, hosting and related services to other leading companies  to power recruitment areas on their Web sites (sometimes referred to as  "Hosted Career Sites"). Personal and/or demographic information  supplied by you in Hosted Career Sites becomes part of the Monster database,  but it is not accessible by anyone other than you, Monster and the company  concerned without your consent.<br>
<br>
Information gathered on a page in a Hosted Career Site or on a co-branded page  (such as that of a contest co-sponsored by <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> and another company), may become the property of the other company or of both  us and the other company. In that instance, the use of such information by the  other company will be subject to the privacy policy of that company. We are not  responsible for that company's use of your personal or demographic information.<br>
<br>
If you apply for a position on <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> or through a Hosted  Career Site, you may be asked to provide information on your gender, race or  other protected status where permitted by applicable law. Some employers are  required by law to gather this information from job applicants for reporting  and record-keeping requirements. You should understand that if provided, this  information will be used by employers only in accordance with applicable law  and will not be used in making any negative employment decisions. All  information provided will be kept separate from your expression of interest in  any job opportunity. Providing this information is strictly voluntary and you  will not be subject to any adverse action or treatment if you choose not to  provide this information.<br>

      <br>
      <br>
      <span class="heading7">6.   Personal Information on Resumes and Profiles<br>
      </span>
      <p>Since <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> is a career site, we  give you three options regarding the accessibility of your resume: </p>
      <ol>

        <li>You  can store your resume in our database, but not allow it to be searchable by  potential employers. Not allowing your resume to be searchable means that you  can use it to apply for a job online, but employers and recruiters will not  have access to search it through our resume database product.<br>
        </li>
        <li>If  you allow your resume to be searchable without making it confidential and  hiding your contact information, then all parties with access to our searchable  resume database (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume.</li>
        <li>If  you have a confidential resume, but apply to a job posting on <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>, the employer to  whom you send your resume will be able to view your contact information. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>We  attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof)  only to paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, and human resource  professionals, as well as law enforcement and national security agencies, but  cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. We  are not responsible for the use made of resumes by third parties who access  such resumes while they are in our searchable database. You may remove your  resume on <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> at anytime, but, employers, recruiters and others who have paid for access to  the <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> resume database or  to obtain a copy of that database as well as parties who have otherwise gained  access may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases.  We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of resumes or profiles  in these instances.<br>

        <strong> </strong></p>
      <span class="heading7">7.   Posting to Public Areas of JobsAhead </span><br>
      Please remember that if you post any of your  personal information in public areas of <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> such as in online forums or chat rooms, or in the <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> searchable resume database, such information  may be collected and used by others over whom we have no control. We are not  responsible for the use made by third parties of information you post or  otherwise make available in public areas of <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>.<br>

      <span class="heading7">8.   Use of Cookies</span><br>
      We use "cookies" to help personalize  and maximize your online experience and time online. A cookie is a text file  that is placed on your hard drive by a Web page server. Cookies are not used to  run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned  to your computer, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that  issued the cookie to you.<br>
      <br>
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to  save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have  returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize &nbsp;<span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> pages, or register for services, a cookie helps  us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password and  preferences). Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more  accurate results and a more personalized site experience. When you return to <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>,  the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use  the features that you customized. We also use cookies to track click streams  and for load balancing.<br>

<br>
You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers  automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting  to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify  your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit  you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.

      <span class="heading7"> 9.   Use of Web Beacons</span><br>
      <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> Web pages may contain electronic images known  as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) that allow us to count  users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web  beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information; they  are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about our Web site  usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie  number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which  the Web beacon resides. <br>

      <br>
You may not decline web beacons, however, they can be rendered ineffective by  declining all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time  a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an  individual basis.<br>

Monster has implemented technical and organizational measures designed to  secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized  access, use, alteration or disclosure. Notwithstanding such measures, the  Internet is an open system and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third  parties will not be able to defeat those measures or use your personal  information for improper purposes. Moreover, one of our primary purposes is to  provide you with a platform to broadcast the information in your resume and  profile widely in order to maximize your career opportunities. Such an environment  does present a risk that unauthorized third parties will view this data, so you  should refer to our Security Center for additional information on conducting a  safe job search. Further, your resume should not contain any sensitive data  that you would not want made public. You should be aware that resumes may be  monitored by your current employer.<br>

      <p><strong class="td_green">Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Java Script</strong><br>
        <br>
        <em class="heading8">Cookies:</em> &nbsp;<span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> uses "cookies" to help personalize and maximize your online  experience and time online, including for storing user preferences, improving  search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends. <br>

        A cookie is a text  file that is either stored in your computer’s memory temporarily (a “session”  cookie) or placed on your hard drive (a “persistent” cookie) by a Web page  server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your  computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer and can only be read  by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.<br>
  <br>
        When you return to the &nbsp;<span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> site, cookies enable us to retrieve  the information you previously provided, so you can easily use the features  that you customized. Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and  more accurate results and a more personalized site experience. For example, if  you personalize &nbsp;<span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> pages, or register for services, a  cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password  and preferences).<br>

  <br>
        We predominately use “session” cookies, which are not permanently stored on  your hard drive. Session cookies expire after two hours of inactivity or when  you close your browser. When you carry out a job search or apply online a large  amount of data is processed by our system and transferred through each page of  the search or application process. This information includes your job search  criteria, data that identifies your resume, covering letter, the job you are  applying for, your right to work in the relevant country and the results of any  questionnaire you have completed as part of the online application process as  well as demographic information that is not unique to you. “Session” cookies  allow us to keep track of this data until you have completed your search or  application. We also use cookies to identify users who have been banned from  using our forums for behavior that contradicts our terms of use and to track  click streams, for load balancing and to enable you to navigate through the  site using redirection pages.<br>
  <br>
        We use “persistent” cookies primarily to ensure that we do not show you pages  that you have already seen and to personalize your site experience and save you  time. “Persistent” Cookies enable us to recognize whether you have responded to  any poll or seen an advertisement or information notice placed on the site so  that we do not show you the poll, advertisement or notice again the next time  you visit our site. If you are a recruiter and have an alliance arrangement in place  with &nbsp;<span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> we also use “persistent” cookies to  recall your alliance status and display your correct pricing information when  you access our site. The “persistent” cookies we use will remain on your  computer after you have left our site and will expire when you log out of the  Site or 60 days after your last visit for security cookies, 90 days after your  last visit for poll response and alliance cookies, or two years after your last  visit for advertisement and information notice cookies.<br>

  <br>
        We also allow other companies to display advertisements to you while you are  visiting our Sites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements  from the other companies’ servers, these companies can view, edit or set their  own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. Monster  has no control over, and is not responsible for, the practices of those third  party advertisers. Monster encourages you to review the policies of such  advertisers.<br>
  <br>
        You will find additional information about the following third party ad servers  at <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com">www.doubleclick.com</a>; <a href="http://www.atlassolutions.com/privacy">www.atlassolutions.com/privacy</a>;  and <a href="http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy">www.omniture.com/en/privacy</a>.  We use other third party ad servers as well; a way to opt out of third party  cookies is to modify your browser settings to decline cookies as described at  the end of this statement. You may also <a href="http://inside.monster.com/ad-network/inside2.aspx">click here</a> to see a list of many of the companies that Monster works with in connection  with serving personalized ads. Otherwise, if you do not wish to allow your  session visitation information on our Sites to be aggregated and analyzed by Omniture,  or used by Omniture to tailor dynamic content to your specific interests, you  may utilize the following opt out mechanism <a href="http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/policy#optout">www.omniture.com/en/privacy/policy#optout</a>.<br>

  <br>
        We use persistent cookies and related technologies (such as web beacons  described below) to determine and track direct and indirect candidate  application traffic in response to Job Postings either on &nbsp;<span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> or on the websites  of third parties through Monster’s Career-Ad-Network (described below). We also  allow persistent third party cookies as part of online advertising campaigns to  determine and track site traffic landing from &nbsp;<span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>’s advertising  banners that have been placed on the websites of third parties. The data  collected via these cookies is anonymous and the information is not linked to  your personally identifiable information without your permission. The  “persistent” cookies placed by our third party ad servers will remain on your  computer after you have left our site for up to 20 years unless you choose to  delete them.<br>

  <br>
        We also use “persistent” cookies in connection with our Career Ad Network  (“CAN”). The CAN cookie is used to display relevant job ads to you on &nbsp;<span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> and when you visit  other web sites. The information collected by the CAN cookie is treated in  accordance with the policies and practices described in our Privacy Statement  above. The “persistent” cookie we use in CAN will remain on your computer after  you have left our site and will expire six months after it was set.<br>

  <br>
        You have the ability to update or opt-out of the CAN cookie by clicking on the  following link: <a href="http://can.monster.com/cookie-technology.aspx">http://can.monster.com/cookie-technology.aspx</a>.  Monster enforces your opt-out of CAN by setting a “blocking cookie”. In order  for the blocking cookie to work on your computer, your browser must be set to  accept third party cookies. The blocking cookie for CAN will last for five  years; however, if you delete your browser cookies, your opt-out cookie, as  well as any updates you may have made, will also be deleted. In addition, your  opt-out only applies in the browser you are using at the time you opt-out and  only on the computer you are using at such time. If you buy a new computer,  change web browsers or delete this cookie, you will need to perform the opt-out  task again. Opting-out of the CAN cookie does not mean you will no longer  receive online advertising from CAN. It does mean that the ads delivered to you  by CAN will no longer be tailored to your Web browsing patterns. Once you  opt-out CAN no longer maintains a targeting cookie on your computer, so the ads  will be general in nature and could be repetitive.<br>

        This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google,  Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed  on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site.

  <br>
        You have the ability to accept or decline cookies at any time by modifying your  browser settings. See below for instructions. If you choose to decline cookies,  however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on  the web site.<br>
  <br>
        Additionally, <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> uses “Flash  cookies”, also known as “Local Shared Objects”, to preserve video player  settings and for user authentication purposes.

        <span class="heading8"><strong><em>Web  Beacons</em>:</strong></span> <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> Web pages and the Web pages of our partners also utilize electronic images  known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs, clear gifs or action  tags) that allow us to collect certain information about users’ visits to these  Web pages (including the number of users who have visited those pages), measure  and improve the effectiveness of advertisements and job postings, and deliver  co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally  identifiable information; they are a technique used to compile aggregated  statistics about web site usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of  information including a cookie number, time and date of page view and a  description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. This information may  be shared with third party processors for processing on behalf of <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span>, as well as with  clients, partners, and other third parties so that they can understand the  kinds of visitors to the Web pages, how those visitors use those Web Pages, and  the effectiveness of their advertisements and job postings. (You will find  information about a current third-party processor used by <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> at <a href="http://www.atlassolutions.com/privacy">www.atlassolutions.com</a>. We may use other  third party processors as well.)<br>

  <br>
        Because Web beacons are the same as any other content request included in the  recipe page, you cannot opt out or refuse them. However, they can be rendered  ineffective by either opting out of cookies or changing the cookie setup in  your browser.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class="heading8"><em>JavaScript:</em></strong> <span class="td_blue">Jobs</span><span class="red_textitalic">Ahead</span> also uses  JavaScript, for example, within certain advertisements. JavaScript is a script  language that enhances the functionality of websites, particularly in respect  to pictures. We are not collecting any personal data via JavaScript but use it  to inform employers about how many applicants have clicked on email addresses  embedded in their job ads, for example. You may deactivate JavaScript via your  browser settings or activate it the same way. If you disable JavaScript you  will not be able to use some of the functions of the website.<br>
