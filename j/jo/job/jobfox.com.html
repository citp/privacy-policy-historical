				At Jobfox, Inc. (<b>“Jobfox”</b> or <b>“us”</b>), we know you are concerned about your privacy, 
					so we developed this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, and disclose your Personal Information.  
					As a guiding principal, our mission at Jobfox is to make a better job marketplace.  That means we take 
					the information you provide us and make it publicly available to a lot of people - all in order to help you 
					find the right job.  You control what information is made publicly available, so if you do not want us to make 
					certain information publicly available, we give you that option.  If you want to protect your identity, we give 
					you tools to help you do that, like the ability to use an alias.  Read on and we will tell you how this all works.
				</p>
				<p>
				By registering with Jobfox and/or using this site (the <b>“Site”</b>) or any other site that is operated 
					by Jobfox, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy.   Each time you visit the 
					Site or provide us with information you agree that you are consenting to our use and disclosure of the information that 
					you provide, and consenting to receive emails, as described in this Privacy Policy.    This Privacy Policy is incorporated 
					into the Jobfox Terms of Service.  If a term is capitalized and not defined in this Privacy Policy, it is defined 
					in the Terms of Service.
				</p>
				<p>
				So we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase <b>“Personal Information”</b> in this 
					Privacy Policy, we mean information about you that is personally identifiable to you, like your name, address, e-mail address, 
					or phone number, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing.  When we use the phrase 
					<b>“Non-Personal Information”</b> in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal 
					Information.   Non-Personal Information does not enable identification of or contact with, individual persons.  Please note 
					that even if you choose to use the “alias” feature provided by Jobfox, the information you submit to Jobfox may still be 
					Personal Information if you provide any information that is personally identifiable to you (like your e-mail address).
				</p>
				<p>
				<span class="textTitleSub">How We Collect Information</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				We receive and store information you give us (either through the Site or in some other way).   
					You may choose, as part of the services available on the Site (the <b>“Services”</b>) Service, to enter Personal Information, 
					including your name, street address, email address, and phone number.  When you create your match profile on the Site, 
					we collect categories of information relevant to your profile, including your contact information, information about 
					your experience, education, desired salary, and travel limitations.  When you submit a resume to us, we collect whatever 
					information you include in your resume.  We do all of this to help us in our effort to help you, find the right job.
				</p>
				<p>
				As you use our Service, we may also passively collect certain information, including your Internet 
					protocol address, browser type, domain names, access times, and operating system. We also use Cookies, clear GIFs, 
					and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the date and time of your 
					use of the Service. This type of information is collected to make our Services more useful to you and to help us 
					improve the Site.
				</p>
				<p>
				We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet 
					business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our 
					advertising and how visitors use our Site. To do this, we use web beacons, clear GIFs and cookies provided by our 
					marketing company on this Site. The information we collect helps us learn things like what kinds of customers our 
					Site attracts, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. 
					Although our marketing company logs the information coming from our Site on our behalf, we control how that data may 
					and may not be used.
				</p>
				<p>
				An “Internet protocol address” or “IP address” is a number that is 
					automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet access provider when you use the Internet.  In some cases 
					your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access 
					provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session.  We track IP addresses solely in conjunction 
					with session cookies to analyze our web page flow.
				</p>
				<p>
				“Cookies” are small pieces of information that a web site sends to 
					your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a web site.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire 
					once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them).  
					Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.
				</p>
				<p>
				<span class="textTitleSub">How We Use Information</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				In general, we use your Personal Information to help you find 
					job opportunities.  We also use your Personal Information to contact you and provide you with information 
					that may be useful or interesting to you, including newsletters regarding changes and upgrades to the 
					Services as well as promotional e-mails.   By using the Site, you agree to receive this information from us.   
					If you do not want  us to send you emails or otherwise contact you,  you can always opt out of communications 
					by following the instructions we provide to you when we contact you.
				</p>
				<p>
				From time-to-time, we may create Non-Personal Information from 
					Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name and other contact information) that would 
					personally identify you.  Generally, we use this Non-Personal Information in statistical analysis to help 
					us analyze patterns in the use of our Services.  We reserve the right to use and disclose Non-Personal 
					Information in our discretion.
				</p>
				<p>
				<span class="textTitleSub">Disclosure of Information</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				We will disclose your Personal Information to employers who may have postings for 
					job openings (“employers”).  We do not control how employers use or disclose information they obtain from us, 
					Including Personal Information, and those employers may also share your Personal Information with other 
					employers that may have job openings.  If you do not want us to allow your Disclosed Profile (as defined below) 
					to be shared with other employers, you may opt out of this feature.  Otherwise, we enable employers to share 
					interesting profiles with other employers.  Also, if you have come to our Site by following a link from one 
					of our affiliates or business partners or by following a link in an online job posting from a potential 
					employer, they may use the information consistent with their privacy policy instead of this Privacy Policy.  
					Since we do not control how they may use your information, we encourage you to read their privacy policies.  
					In addition, we may disclose your Personal Information to third parties with whom we have a co-branding 
					or promotional relationship, including other job sites.  If you would like to know the third party marketing 
					partners to whom we have disclosed your Personal Information, just let us know and we will tell you.
				</p>
				<p>
				<span class="textTitleSub">Disclosure of Information</span><br>
				In addition, we may disclose your Personal Information:<br>&nbsp;<br>
					(a)  if such disclosure is made to comply with the law or an order issued by a court or an authorized administrative 
					agency, respond to a subpoena, protect the rights or property of Jobfox or its affiliated companies, prevent a crime, 
					or protect the personal safety or rights of others;<br>&nbsp;<br>
					(b)  to our service providers for the purpose of providing services on our behalf, such as customer service, 
					information technology services, and hosting services;<br>&nbsp;<br>
					(c) as part of a merger or consolidation, or part of the sale of all or substantially all the stock or assets of the 
					business to which the information pertains; and<br>&nbsp;<br>
					(d) as part of a disposition in a bankruptcy proceeding in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court.
				</p>
				<p>
				Please be aware that when you voluntarily display or distribute Personal Information on 
					the Site or in other ways, that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited 
					messages from third parties.  We cannot be responsible for Personal Information you voluntarily display, 
					disclose or distribute on the Site or in any other way.
				</p>
				<p>
				Although we currently do not have any corporate affiliates, such as a parent company, 
					subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, “Affiliates”), we may 
					in the future. We may share some or all of your Personal Information with these Affiliates, in which case we 
					will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.
				</p>
				<p>
				<span class="textTitleSub">How to Mask Your Identity</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				Giving you tools to help you protect your contact information is a vital part of our mission.  
					The Services provide you the option to mask your identity from employers by choosing an alias for your Disclosed 
					Profile and generalizing other potentially identifying information that you have provided to us.  If you do 
					not want an employer or the public to know your identity, you must choose an alias and you must separately 
					pseudonymize your resume before submitting it to Jobfox.
				</p>
				<p>
				You need to be careful, because your resume or other information you provide to us may 
					reveal your identity.  It is up to you to make sure your alias and the information you provide to us truly 
					masks your identity.  Jobfox does not have any obligation to modify: (1) potentially identifying information 
					in your Disclosed Profile, or (2) your resume to remove or mask information that may identify you.  Your 
					<b>“Disclosed Profile”</b> means your Personal Information that Jobfox may disclose to an employer (including your resume) 
					according to the settings you choose in your profile.
				</p>
				<p>
				<span class="textTitleSub">Employers Use of Your Disclosed Profile</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Note that Jobfox does not have any control over how an employer 
					uses and discloses your Personal Information, including information you provide directly to that employer.  
					You acknowledge and agree that (1) Jobfox does not evaluate any employer’s privacy practices, and (2) Jobfox 
					will not have any liability for any actions of any employer.</b>  You should know that employers to whom we may 
					disclose your Disclosed Profile may share your Disclosed Profile with others.
				</p>
				<p>
				<span class="textTitleSub">Accessing and Controlling Your Information</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				We are committed to giving you control over your Personal Information.  You may access 
					the Personal Information you provide to us, and may modify or delete that information, by logging into to 
					your account and editing it.  If you request that we delete your Personal Information we will, but we may 
					retain Non-Personal Information that was derived from your Personal Information, and we may also retain 
					your Personal Information in our backup files for a period of time.  Please remember, however, that if 
					we have already disclosed some of your Personal Information, we can not access that Personal Information 
					any longer and can not force the deletion or modification of that Personal Information by the parties to 
					whom we have made those disclosures.
				</p>
				<p>
				<span class="textTitleSub">Security</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				Jobfox is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Information.  We use 
					a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Information 
					from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.   Even though we have taken steps to ensure that your Personal 
					Information is not intercepted, accessed, used, or disclosed by unauthorized persons, you should know that 
					we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information.  You assume all responsibility 
					and risk for your use of the Site and the information you post or access through the Site.
				</p>
				<p>
				<span class="textTitleSub">User Feedback</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				If you provide feedback, any such comments and any email we receive becomes the 
					property of Jobfox.  We may use feedback for marketing purposes or to add to or modify our Services without 
					paying any royalties or other compensation to you.
				</p>
				<p>
				<span class="textTitleSub">Changes</span>
				</p>
				<p>
				This Privacy Policy is subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial 
					changes to it, we will post an alert on this page.  If you object to any such changes, you must cease using 
					our Service and request that we delete your profile.  Continued use of our Service following notice of any 
					such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and 
					conditions of such changes.  All such changes will apply to previously collected information.
				</p>
				<p>
