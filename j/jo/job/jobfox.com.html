			At Jobfox, Inc. (<strong>“Jobfox”</strong> or <strong>“us”</strong>),
			we know you are concerned about your privacy, so we developed this Privacy Policy
			to explain how we collect, use, and disclose your Personal Information. As a guiding
			principal, our mission at Jobfox is to make a better job marketplace. That means
			we take the information you provide us and make it publicly available to a lot of
			people - all in order to help you find the right job. You control what information
			is made publicly available, so if you do not want us to make certain information
			publicly available, we give you that option. If you want to protect your identity,
			we give you tools to help you do that, like the ability to block certain domains
			from accessing your information. Read on and we will tell you how this all works.
		</p>
		<p>
			By registering with Jobfox and/or using this site (the <b>“Site”</b>)
			or any other site that is operated by Jobfox, you are accepting the policies and
			practices described in this Privacy Policy. Each time you visit the Site or provide
			us with information you agree that you are consenting to our use and disclosure
			of the information that you provide, and consenting to receive emails, as described
			in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the Jobfox Terms
			of Service. If a term is capitalized and not defined in this Privacy Policy, it
			is defined in the Terms of Service.</p>
		<p>
			So we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase <b>“Personal
				Information”</b> in this Privacy Policy, we mean information about you that
			is personally identifiable to you, like your name, address, e-mail address, or phone
			number, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing.
			When we use the phrase <b>“Non-Personal Information”</b> in this Privacy
			Policy, we mean information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal
			Information. Non-Personal Information does not enable identification of or contact
			with, individual persons.</p>
		<h2>
			How We Collect Information</h2>
		<p>
			We receive and store information you give us (either through the Site or in some
			other way). You may choose, as part of the services available on the Site (the <b>
				“Services”</b>) Service, to enter Personal Information, including your
			name, street address, email address, credit card number and phone number. When you
			create your match profile on the Site, we collect categories of information relevant
			to your profile, including your contact information, information about your experience,
			education, desired salary, and travel limitations. When you submit a resume to us,
			we collect whatever information you include in your resume. We do all of this to
			help us in our effort to help you, find the right job.</p>
		<p>
			As you use our Service, we may also passively collect certain information, including
			your Internet protocol address, browser type, domain names, access times, and operating
			system. We also use Cookies, clear GIFs, and navigational data like Uniform Resource
			Locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the date and time of your use of
			the Service. This type of information is collected to make our Services more useful
			to you and to help us improve the Site.</p>
		<p>
			If you feel that the services of Jobfox.com could be useful for a third party you
			know (e.g. your friends or family members etc), you may use our referral service.
			If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will
			ask you for your friend”s email address. We will automatically send your friend
			a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Jobfox stores this information
			for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of
			our referral program.</p>
		<p>
			We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our
			Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company
			We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our
			Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company
			to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising on other web sites and how
			visitors use our Site. To do this, we use web beacons, clear GIFs and cookies provided
			by our marketing company on this Site. The information we collect helps us learn
			things like what kinds of customers our Site attracts, which of our products most
			interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although
			our marketing company logs the information coming from our Site on our behalf, we
			control how that data may and may not be used.
		</p>
		<p>
			An <b>“Internet protocol address”</b> or <b>“IP address”</b>
			is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet access
			provider when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP address stays the same
			from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access
			provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session. We track IP addresses
			solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyze our web page flow.</p>
		<p>
			<b>“Cookies”</b> are small pieces of information that a web site sends
			to your computer”s hard drive while you are viewing a web site. We may use
			both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent
			Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). Persistent Cookies
			can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. Our cookies do
			not contain any personally identifiable information.</p>
		<h2>
			How We Use Information</h2>
		<p>
			In general, we use your Personal Information to help you find job opportunities.
			We also use your Personal Information to contact you and provide you with information
			that may be useful or interesting to you, including newsletters regarding changes
			and upgrades to the Services as well as promotional e-mails. By using the Site,
			you agree to receive this information from us. If you do not want us to send you
			emails or otherwise contact you, you can always opt out of communications by clicking
			on the unsubscribe links provided when we contact you.
		</p>
		<p>
			From time-to-time, we may create Non-Personal Information from Personal Information
			by excluding information (such as your name and other contact information) that
			would personally identify you. Generally, we use this Non-Personal Information in
			statistical analysis to help us analyze patterns in the use of our Services. We
			reserve the right to use and disclose Non-Personal Information in our discretion.</p>

			one of our affiliates or business partners or by following a link in an online job

			for Personal Information you voluntarily display, disclose or distribute on the
			Site or in any other way.</p>
		<p>
			Although we currently do not have any corporate affiliates, such as a parent company,
			subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively,
			“<b>Affiliates</b>”), we may in the future. We will share some or all
			of your Personal Information with these Affiliates, in which case we will require
			our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.</p>

				privacy practices, and (2) Jobfox will not have any liability for any actions of
				any employer.</b> You should know that employers to whom we may disclose your
			Disclosed Profile may share your Disclosed Profile with others.</p>
		<h2>
			Accessing and Controlling Your Information</h2>
		<p>

			the Personal Information you provide to us, and may modify or delete that information,

			Personal Information we will, but we may retain Non-Personal Information that was
			derived from your Personal Information, and we may also retain your Personal Information
			in our backup files for a period of time. Please remember, however, that if we have
			already disclosed some of your Personal Information, we can not access that Personal
			Information any longer and can not force the deletion or modification of that Personal
			Information by the parties to whom we have made those disclosures.</p>

		<p>
