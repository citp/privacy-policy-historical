## Personal information in your curriculum vitae

When posting your online curriculum vitae (CV) on Jobillico.com, we require your telephone number in addition to the mandatory information indicated. Additional personal information included in your online CV serves to describe your skills, experience and job preferences. It is not necessary to indicate in your online CV certain confidential and personal information about your private life, political or religious beliefs or ethnicity.

Your online CV allows you to receive job postings only if you authorize employers and recruiters to access your CV. Jobillico has established strict security measures and rigorously protects the privacy of your personal information and respects how you choose this information to be used. We carefully protect your data from any loss, inappropriate use, unauthorized access or disclosure, modification or destruction. Though our CV bank can be accessed solely by users who pay registration fees, we cannot guarantee or be held liable for the conduct of a third party.

You can remove your online CV from Jobillico.com at any time. Your personal information will remain stored on our servers for a certain period of time in the event that you should decide to use our services again, or for our protection in the event of litigation.

When entering your personal information, you are free to answer or ignore fields marked “optional.” However, the fields marked “optional” that have not been completed could limit the customized services available to you.

## Access to your personal information

We have provided means for ensuring the accuracy of your personal information. You will have the option of editing or updating this information at any time from your virtual office. In particular:

  * You can view, modify or update the personal information already provided.
  * You can register. Once you have registered, you will no longer have to provide us with your information. Your information will accompany you wherever you go on Jobillico.com.



## Security

PayPal and Desjardins guarantees the security of your e-commerce transactions according to their terms of use for all transactions made using a credit card or any other method. You will be required to use a 256-bit encrypted password whenever you wish to access information in your personal account. 

Your personal information will never be shared with other users without your explicit authorization, except under the conditions stipulated below in the paragraph “Use of personal information.” Our company stores data on a limited-access server protected by a password. Your information is stored or processed in Québec where Jobillico, its representatives, agents and employees are located.

You also have an important role to play in protecting your personal information. No one can view or modify your personal information without your user name and password. It is therefore important to keep this information confidential. Jobillico cannot be held liable for possible damages caused by the disclosure of information transmitted over the Internet, given that it is impossible to guarantee absolute security. Please be vigilant.

## Message for parents

Dear parents and guardians: we want to help you protect your child’s privacy. We recommend that you show your children how to safely and responsibly use their personal information when using the Internet.

If you have concerns about the fact that your children or adolescents are providing personal information on the Internet with your consent, you must provide them with all the necessary safety advice and tips so that they are protected against fraud, harassment or criminal acts that could occur due to a lack of vigilance when using the Internet. If you are a victim of fraud in any form, it is your responsibility to report the incident to the police.
