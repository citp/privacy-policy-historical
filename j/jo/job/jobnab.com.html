  <p class="siteColor"><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
  <p> Some pages on this web site employ browser session "cookies." A  cookie is a small piece of data that a web site transfers to your computer's  hard disk to allow the server to distinguish your session from that of others  while you are connected.

The  cookies and the information about your session are automatically destroyed  shortly after you close your browser. The information is not permanently stored  on your computer. We do not collect personal information about you except as  described above.</p>
