          <br>
      By using this JobGroupz.com Website, you agree to the collection and use of  your information by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy. <br>
  <br>
  <span class="style25">Changes to the Privacy Policy </span><br>
      We reserve the right to change the terms of this Privacy Policy at any time  without notice. Any changes will be posted on this page and visitors are  encouraged to check this page regularly. Your continued use of the Website  following any changes to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of  such changes.</p>
      <p><span class="style25">Information Collection and Use</span><br>
        We collect information on the Site at two different  stages. First, we collect<br>
        anonymous, aggregate information (such as domain name or  IP address) from all<br>
        visitors to the Site. This type of information is never  linked to any personally<br>
        identifiable information and is only used in the aggregate  to generate statistical<br>
      reports about the use of the Site. Second, we may require  the submission of certain personally identifiable information when you use the  features of or services available on this Site.</p>
      <span class="style25">Cookies and Privacy&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<br>
      Although some  cookies provide a useful function, many others may not be desirable. As the  Internet has evolved from its beginnings in academia and government to a  commercial enterprise, cookies have inevitably been turned into a tracking  mechanism used by advertisers. In principle, cookies are only accessible to the  site that originated them but large advertising agencies with many clients can  easily circumvent this restriction by collecting information for all their  clients under one domain. A fairly harmless (and perhaps even useful)  advertising application of cookies is to rotate banner ads as you go from page  to page to make sure that you do not see the same ads over and over. However,  there are more invasive tracking methods that might involve cookies and therein  arise privacy issues
      <p><span class="style25"><strong>&nbsp;What is the DoubleClick  DART cookie?</strong></span> <br>
      The <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx">DoubleClick DART cookie</a> is used by Google in the ads served on the websites of its partners, such as  websites displaying AdSense ads or participating in Google certified ad  networks. When users visit a partner's website and either view or click on an  ad, a cookie may be dropped on that end user's browser. The data gathered from  these cookies will be used to help better serve and manage ads on the  publisher's site(s) and across the web.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on  a user's prior visits to your website. </li>
        <li>Google's use of the DART cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads  to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the  Internet. </li>
        <li>Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">advertising opt-out page</a>.
