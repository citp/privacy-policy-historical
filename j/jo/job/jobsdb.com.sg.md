## Cookies and Log Files

The Company does not collect any personally identifiable information from any users whilst they visit and browse the Website. When users access the Website, the Company records their visits only and does not collect their personal information or data. The Website's server software will also record the domain name server address and track the pages users visit and store such information in "cookies", and gather and store information such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data, in log files. All these are done without users being aware that they are occurring.

Such automatically collected information and data will not be disclosed save and except in accordance with the section entitled "Disclosure or Transfer of Data" (above).

## Links to Other Sites

The Website may provide links to other websites which are not owned or controlled by the Company. Personal information and data from users may be collected by third parties on these other websites when users visit such websites and make use of the services provided therein.
