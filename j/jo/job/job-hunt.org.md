# The Privacy Policy for Job-Hunt.Org

At Job-Hunt, we are committed to being a trustworthy partner in your job search. You can visit Job-Hunt.Org as often as you want without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.

**Passive Information Collected**

**      Server Log Files:** We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movements from page to page to understand what our visitors like and don't like, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use (e.g. browser used, monitor resolution, etc.). IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Information Collected Actively**

******      Subscriber E-mail Addresses: ** We offer our visitors the opportunity to subscribe ("opt-in") to the [Online Job-Hunting Guide Newsletter](https://web.archive.org/web/20130313115845id_/http%3A//www.job-hunt.org/whynews.shtml), our free e-mail newsletter. Consequently, a visitor wishing to receive the newsletter must give us their e-mail address. We use [MailChimp.com](http://www.mailchimp.com/) to manage these e-mail addresses. They are used only to fulfill subscription requests. We will never knowingly cause you to receive unsolicited commercial e-mail (a.k.a. "spam") as a result of your subscription.

**      Opt-Out:**  
Participation in the newsletter is completely voluntary and may be terminated by the subscriber at any time by clicking on the Unsubscribe link at the bottom of every newsletter, or sending us an "unsubscribe" message from the un-subscribing email address to [remove@Job-Hunt.Org](mailto:subscriptions@job-hunt.org) or by replying to a newsletter with the word "remove" in the subject line. Please note we cannot remove an email address unless it is provided by the person wishing to unsubscribe it.

**Shared Data:**  
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

No personally identifiable information (i.e. e-mail addresses of newsletter subscribers) will be intentionally shared with any 3rd party unless, we believe, in good faith, that such release is necessary to: 

  * Comply with the law 
  * Protect the rights, property, or safety of Job-Hunt.Org, our visitors, or the public.
  * Provide supportive services to Job-Hunt.Org (see Third Parties, below) or to NETability, Inc., the parent company.

We may also transfer personally identifiable information to a buyer of all or part of our business, in the event of a sale.

**Third Parties:   
**Agents of Job-Hunt.Org provide supportive services, such as e-mail list management services for Job-Hunt's newsletter, hosting for Job-Hunt's Web site, etc. However, these third parties are not allowed to use any information disclosed to them for any purpose other than the support of Job-Hunt.

**Google Analytics  
****June, 2007** , we added Google Analytics to Job-Hunt so we could better understand what our visitors want. We see this information only in aggregate, but Google does set a cookie to help track visitor actions. You may set your browser to refuse the cookie.

**Outside Links:**  
**This privacy statement applies solely to Job-Hunt.Org.** This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Job-Hunt.Org is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. _We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information._ Job-Hunt.Org is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. Before adding those sites to Job-Hunt's categorized lists of links, each site is evaluated to see if they protect the privacy of their visitors and, particularly, their job applicants. We do not knowingly add sites that treat applicant information casually. However, a site _may change_ its policies and practices after being added to Job-Hunt. 

Please read [Protecting Your Privacy](https://web.archive.org/web/20130313115845id_/http%3A//www.job-hunt.org/privacy.shtml), [ Choosing a Job Site](https://web.archive.org/web/20130313115845id_/http%3A//www.job-hunt.org/choosing.shtml), and our [Disclaimer](https://web.archive.org/web/20130313115845id_/http%3A//www.job-hunt.org/disclaimer.html) regarding these sites.

**Cookies:**  
A "cookie" is a piece of data stored on the visitor's hard drive containing information about the visitor. In some circumstances, we use "cookies" to test visitor reactions to some particular aspect of Job-Hunt or to track the number of visitors for our advertisers. Job-Hunt's use of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information. You can usually modify the security setting of your browser to block or to accept cookies. Check your browser's Help function for more information

**Advertisers/Sponsors:**  
Job-Hunt practices transparency in revenue generation. Revenue-generating links are identified as "Sponsors" or are in the "Sponsors" column of Job-Hunt. Read the individual privacy policies available on each Sponsor's Website to understand the practices of each of these organizations. At Job-Hunt.Org, we carefully screen our advertisers to ensure that they offer quality service to our visitors as well as respecting our visitors' privacy. They may change their policies and/or mislead us, but we will do our best to respect and protect our visitors. We cannot guaranty privacy protection perfection, however, so you must also be vigilant in pro-actively protecting your own privacy, too.

**Notification of Changes:  
**If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on our home page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
