**About Privacy**  
We collect only the aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit. This information is used to improve the content of our Web site and is not shared with other organizations nor is it used for direct marketing purposes. 

We also collect on certain pages information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information. The purpose of this information is always stated along with the survey. By submitting such information, Workstream will not subscribe you to any services, free or with charge, nor will we contact you, unless you requested so. We also offer a newsletter where subscribers can opt-in and out. If you wish to unsubscribe from this newsletter, you can do so at any time by sending an email to an address provided at the bottom of that newsletter, or by calling us at the address below. 

By subscribing to our newsletter or any other service offered by Workstream, you will only receive this service. Workstream will not subscribe you to other services, nor will we send you unsolicited email, unless you grant the permission to be sent such correspondence. 

**About Cookies**  
Cookies are a message given to a Web browser by a Web server. The browser stores the message in a text file called cookie.txt. The message is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.
