**Cookies**  
Our Site uses cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a web server to store on a web browser so it can later be read back from that browser. This is useful for having the browser remember specific information so that your experience is customized. This allows us to store preferences of start pages.

An email address is required to register for our site. JobsInME.com will never sell or share your email address to a third party vendor. However, if you choose to publish your email address in a job or in a resume stored in our database, this information becomes public, and there is a possibility this information can be copied by our customers site visitors. 

**External Links**

You must also be aware of the possibility that your resume and file information will be copied into hiring authority and recruiter databases. JobsInME.com has no control nor will assume any liability for the actions of any third party. 

As an Applicant, you can decide not to post your resume and still establish an Account. By completing a Qualifications Summary, you can maintain your confidentiality while being made aware of career opportunities. The text of your Qualifications Summary is keyword searchable. If registered hiring authorities or recruiters want to contact you they can send an Inquiry to you. You then have the option of responding to their Inquiry or not. 

You can post your resume but omit your name and contact information. Because your resume can be keyword searched, your file is more likely to be retrieved by hiring managers when they are conducting a search. Keeping a resume on file also allows you to respond quickly to interested recruiters who have sent an Inquiry to your "My Home" page on JobsInME.com. 

If confidentiality is not important to you, you can post your resume including your name and contact information. All hiring authorities and recruiters who are Registered Users of the JobsInME.com Applicant Database will have access to your file including your name and all contact detail as supplied by you. They will have the option of contacting you directly or sending an Inquiry through JobsInME.com.
