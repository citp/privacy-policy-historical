# JobsInKent.com - Privacy Policy

JIK Software Limited make every effort to comply with our obligations under the 1998 Data Protection Act.

We understand the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of your CV and other information you may give us while using the site.

All information we hold about you is provided only by you.

**Registration Details**  
Contact and other details you supply as part of the registration process are stored by us and used to provide you with the service you have requested.

**Profile and CV Information**  
When you complete your registration with us, your details and/or cv may be made available for searching, viewing over the Internet and downloading by our customers. Customers who request CVs matching your profile will have access to your CV and profile. These may be direct recruiters, employment consultants or other organisations.

You can choose to make your personal details and your CV anonymous (by ensuring there is no identifiable information on your profile or CV), while having your CV available to be searched on by recruitment agencies, employment agencies and businesses. You can then choose to reveal yourself when you receive a reply from an interested party.

**IMPORTANT:** Your current employer may be a customer of JIK Software Limited's, or a client of one of our customers. We cannot restrict the customers who access profiles on our database and cannot be held responsible for any eventuality.

We rely on you to ensure that your CV and contact details are kept up to date. You should update your CV at least every six months, particularly if your contact details have changed.

Please note that JIK Software Limited reserves the right to remove from our database CVs which include any content that we consider to be illegal or offensive. We will also remove a CV if a complaint is upheld, which has been made against it.

**Statistical Information:**  
We provide statistical information about site visitors and users to recruiters (such as the number of CVs on the database, or the number of visitors to the site) and for other lawful purposes. We provide this information to customers, advertisers, suppliers and other reputable third parties. This will not include any information that enables them to identify individuals.
