# Privacy Policy

** Privacy Policy**

We do not collect much information at Jobseekers Advice and the one rule we follow that set's us apart from other sites is:  ** We will never pass your information onto anyone else.  Period.**

This section will give you a brief overview of the information we do collect and how we use it.

** Discussion Forum**

In order to participate on our [discussion forum](https://web.archive.org/web/20110528055426id_/http%3A//jobseekersadvice.com/forum2/index.php), you need to register.

The minimum amount of information you need to do this is to add your email address (you also need to select an username and password to login).  You can also add other details about yourself but this is optional.

We require registration on our forum for a number of reasons, mainly to stop the number of spammers.

When you post on our forum, or simply register, your IP address is logged.  This means we can ban or block anyone who is misbehaving (there are a lot of idiots out there!).

Any information that you add to your profile on the discussion forum is available for other members to view.

We will not share this information with anyone.  We do not conduct any mass marketing activities.

Occasionally we have and may in future contact individual members on various issues, but never with an aim to selling anything (we have nothing to sell!).  These are usually issues relating the site.

** Cookies**

Our forum software leaves a cookie on your computer.  This is to enable you to return to the forum without having to log in.  Our cookies do not record any individual information about you and we have no access to files on your machine.  Most websites will leave a cookie on your computer these days.

** Statistics**

We use statistics software to monitor the progress and growth of the site.

This records various information, such as IP address of visitors, country the site was accessed from, what pages were viewed and what site or search engine referred visitors to our site.

This information is not collected about individuals.  It is presented in a summary format for a particular timescale.  For example, one report may be how many unique visitors came to our site during the month of March.

We use this information to monitor new additions to the site and gauge their effectiveness, as well as monitoring our marketing activities.  This information is not passed onto anyone outside of Jobseekers Advice.

**Free CV Appraisals**

We off a [free CV appraisal service](https://web.archive.org/web/20110528055426id_/http%3A//jobseekersadvice.com/cv_advice/free_cv_appraisal.htm) on our discussions forums.

We encourage you to not post contact details on your CV - the forum is for feedback only and **not** recruitment.

We will never pass your CV onto any other company or organisation.  However, we have many recruiters and employers on our forums so by posting your CV, they may contact you independently.  It is possible for you to withhold your email address when you register on the forums (ie, hide it from other members), so if you do this, the only way people can contact you is by posting on the public forum.

If you have any comments or concerns about our privacy policy, then feel free to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20110528055426id_/http%3A//jobseekersadvice.com/contact_us.htm).
