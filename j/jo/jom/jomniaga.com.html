            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p><strong>Web Form Information</strong></p>
            <p>When   you submit information to JomNiaga to make a payment or open an   account, we may collect personally identifiable information from you   that may include your name, address, email address, and credit card   number. We do not knowingly collect personal information from persons   under the age of eighteen.</p>
            <p><strong>Website Usage Information</strong></p>
            <p>We   automatically collect IP addresses and website usage information from   you when you access any of our online services. This information helps   us evaluate how our visitors and subscribers use and navigate our   websites on an aggregate basis, including, but not limited to, the   number and frequency of visitors and subscribers to each web page and   the length of their visits.</p>
            <p><strong>How We Use Information Collected</strong></p>
            <p>We may use information in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To   perform the actions for which you specifically provided the information   (for example, enabling us to process, validate, and verify purchases).</li>
                <li>To register you as a client and establish an account for you.</li>
                <li>To   send you email notifications about our new or existing JomNiaga   products and services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you.</li>
                <li>To enhance existing features or develop new features, products and services.</li>
                <li>To provide advertisers and other third parties with aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns.</li>
                <li>To allow us to personalize the content and advertising that you and others see based on personal characteristics or preferences.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Except   as specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share,   sell, rent, or trade your personally identifiable information with any   entity outside of JomNiaga for promotional purposes.</p>
            <p>We may   disclose and use personally identifiable information in special   circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our service agreements or   terms of use (for example, to protect our intellectual property   rights). We may also disclose or use your personal information when we,   in good faith, believe that the law may require us to do so.</p>
            <p>We   reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information   as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to   protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court   order, or legal process served on our website.        </p>
            <strong>Orders</strong>
            <p>If you purchase a product or service from us, we   request certain personally identifiable information from you on our   order form.

            <p>We use this information for billing   purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an   order, we will use this information to contact you.</p>
            <p><strong>Updating Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
            <p>If   your personally identifiable information changes you may request the   information be corrected, updated, amended, or deleted through our <a target="_blank" href="http://support.jomniaga.com">Contact Us page</a> or by contacting us at the contact information listed below. We will respond to your request within 30 days.</p>
            <p><strong>Information Collection</strong></p>
            <p>JomNiaga   automatically receives and records information on our server logs from   your browser, including your IP address, cookies, and the pages you   request. This data is only used in the aggregate. JomNiaga uses   information for the following general purposes: products and services   provisioning, billing, identification and authentication, services   improvement, contact, research, and anonymous reporting. IP addresses   are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web   page. IP addresses may be used for various research purposes.</p>
            <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
            <p>We   define a cookie as any string of data that is automatically stored on   your computer upon access to our online services. JomNiaga employs   cookies to assign temporary identification numbers to machines that   access our web servers. This information enables us to deliver faster   service to our users, prevent Denial of Service attacks on our systems,   detect and prevent fraudulent transactions, and assist with awarding   proper sales credit to our partners. All JomNiaga cookies are 1) of   limited duration, 2) less than 5KB in length, 3) only visible to   JomNiaga web servers, and 4) devoid of any personally identifiable   information.</p>
            <p>Third parties also use cookies and other tracking technologies on our site, of which data is only collected in the aggregate.</p>
            <p><strong>What and How Information is Used</strong></p>
            <p>JomNiaga   may send you email notifications about our new or existing JomNiaga   products and special offers specific to you. Out of respect for your   privacy, you can unsubscribe by clicking "unsubscribe" within the email.   You may not opt-out of service-related communications, which are not   promotional in nature. </p>
            <p><strong>Policy on Information Sharing</strong></p>
            <p>Outside   of the vendor who participated in your transaction, we will not sell,   rent, share, or trade your personal information to third parties for   promotional purposes. It may be necessary to share information in order   to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,   suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical   safety of any person, if required by law. In some cases, JomNiaga may   choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer   information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred.   JomNiaga will transfer information about you if we are acquired by or   merged with another company.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to disclose your   personally identifiable information as required by law and when we   believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply   with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our   website.</p>
            <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
            <p>The security of your personal information   is important to us. When you enter sensitive information such as credit   card number on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that   information using SSL.</p>
            <p>We follow generally accepted industry   standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted   to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of   transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%   secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially   acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot   guarantee its absolute security.</p>
            <p>The information we collect about   you is stored in limited access servers. We maintain safeguards to   protect the security of these servers and your personally identifiable   information. We retain personally identifiable information only as long   as necessary to complete a purchase, thwart fraud, or provide customer   service.</p>
            <strong>Newsletters</strong>
            <p>If   you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we will use your name and   email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your   privacy, you can unsubscribe by clicking "unsubscribe" within the email.</p>
            <strong>Agents/Service Providers        </strong>
            <p>We   use other third parties such as a database backup provider to protect   our data, a fraud prevention service, and an email service provider to   send out emails on our behalf.When you sign up for these services, we   will share your personal information as necessary for the third party to   provide that service.</p>
            <p><strong>Blogs and Testimonials</strong></p>
            <p>If   you use a bulletin board, blog, or open forum on this website, you   should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit   there may be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums,   and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not   responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to   submit in these forums. We also have testimonials on our site, which   post personally identifiable information. All individuals who have   posted their testimonials have given permission to do so as a client.</p>
            <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
            <p>If   you click on a link to a third party site you will leave our site and   go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of   third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your   personally identifiable information by such third parties, and we cannot   guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as us. We   encourage you to review the privacy statements of any other service   provider from whom you request services.</p>
            <p><strong>Changes in this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
            <p>If   we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to   this Privacy Policy and other places we deem appropriate so that you are   aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what   circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to   modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently.   If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by   email, or by means of a notice on your Account Home page.</p>
