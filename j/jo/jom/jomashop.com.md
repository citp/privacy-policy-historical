The secured pages will show a secured URL ("https://") and a lock sign on your browser. When you enter your credit card number into the Order Form, it is transmitted across the Internet in an encrypted (scrambled) form, then decoded when it gets to the server.

Additionally, your credit card information is not transmitted via e-mail, which is not encrypted. Our online credit-card processing software does not allow more than one charge to the same credit card number or for the same order number.

Should you have any problem with your credit card charge, you can always depend on our prompt attention and service to resolve the problem. You may also dispute charges with your credit card company.
