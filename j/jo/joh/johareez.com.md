We work closely with certain business partners and carefully selected vendors to provide you with access to their product offerings or to their online stores (for example, the Partners listed on Johareez.com and Johareez products available at Johareez.com). We may share our data, including personally identifiable information about you, with these business partners or selected vendors, and they may use this information to offer you products and/or services that may be of interest to you. If you choose to access the Partners, disclose information to the Partners, place orders from the Partners, and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their applicable privacy policies. To prevent our disclosure of your personally identifiable information to one of these third parties, you can choose not use their services or order their products. Because we do not control the privacy practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practices before deciding to use their services or place orders with them for their products.

Agents

Government and Legal Disclosures of Your Information

We may disclose information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we believe necessary in connection with an investigation of illegal activity that may expose you or us to legal liability. In addition, if you have purchased products from us on extended payment terms, it may be necessary for us to file certain information about you with state or local government offices to perfect our security interest in the products so purchased, or to provide certain information about you to collection agencies in the event of non-payment or a payment dispute.
