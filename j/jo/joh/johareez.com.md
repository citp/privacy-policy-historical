**Does Johareez.com Disclose the Information It Receives?**  
   
As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personally identifiable information may be disclosed. 

**Business Partners and Selected Vendors We Do Not Control**  
We work closely with certain business partners and carefully selected vendors to provide you with access to their product offerings or to their online stores (for example, the Partners listed on Johareez.com and Johareez products available at Johareez.com). We may share our data, including personally identifiable information about you, with these business partners or selected vendors, and they may use this information to offer you products and/or services that may be of interest to you. If you choose to access the Partners, disclose information to the Partners, place orders from the Partners, and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their applicable privacy policies. To prevent our disclosure of your personally identifiable information to one of these third parties, you can choose not use their services or order their products. Because we do not control the privacy practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practices before deciding to use their services or place orders with them for their products. 

**Agents**  
We use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company (Paysignet E-Transactions) to complete payments for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes. 

**Service Providers**  
Johareez.com uses a third-party tracking service called Omniture SiteCatalyst that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site in aggregate form. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. 

**Business Transfers**  
As we continue to develop our business, we might buy the online and/or off-line retail operations of others. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that Johareez.com or substantially all of its assets are acquired by or transferred to another entity, customer information would likely be one of the transferred assets. 

**Government and Legal Disclosures of Your Information**  
We may disclose information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we believe necessary in connection with an investigation of illegal activity that may expose you or us to legal liability. In addition, if you have purchased products from us on extended payment terms, it may be necessary for us to file certain information about you with state or local government offices to perfect our security interest in the products so purchased, or to provide certain information about you to collection agencies in the event of non-payment or a payment dispute. 

**Links to and from Other Web Sites**  
Johareez.com regularly offers links to other Web sites, which may include the Partner Web sites of our business partners or selected vendors. These Web sites have their own policies regarding privacy. In addition, you may have linked to Johareez.com through another site, such as by means of a banner advertisement for Johareez.com on that other site. In such cases, the site you linked from may collect information from people who click on the banner or link. You may want to refer to the privacy policies on those sites to see how they collect and use this information.
