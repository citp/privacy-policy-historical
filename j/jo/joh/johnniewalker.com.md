For instance, a website may be able to provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by storing in a cookie the region in which you are currently located. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise.

Information about many of Diageo’s brands can be found at [www.diageobrands.com](http://www.diageobrands.com/ "Diageo Brands").

We occasionally may send you communications about brands not featured on [www.diageobrands.com](http://www.diageobrands.com/ "Diageo Brands") (e.g., new brands). We recommend that you refer to [www.diageobrands.com](http://www.diageobrands.com/ "Diageo Brands") from time to time as the list of featured brands will be updated periodically.

Providing general permission for us to communicate with you about our brands does not mean that you will receive communications about all of Diageo’s brands. We will only communicate with you about those brands that we think may be of particular interest to you. Any such communications will provide you with an opportunity to unsubscribe from the brand in question and/or from all communications about Diageo brands.
