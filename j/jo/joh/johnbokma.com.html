<p>
    I recognize that privacy of your personal information is important.
    Here is information on what types of personal information I receive and collect when you use visit johnbokma.com,
    and how I safeguard your information.
</p>
<p>
    Information I collect through log files or comments posted on this site will
    never be sold to third parties.
</p>
<h2>Log Files</h2>
<p class="first">
    As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files.  The information in the log files include
    your IP address, the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our
    site and which pages you visited throughout our site.
</p>
<h2>Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>
<p class="first">
    Currently I use third party advertisements (AdSense) on johnbokma.com to support my site.  Some
    of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on
    my site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program)
    information including your IP address, the browser you used to visit my site, and in some cases,
    whether you have Flash installed.  This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York
    real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites
    visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
</p>
<p>
    You can chose to disable or selectively turn off third-party cookies in your browser settings,
    or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security.  However, this can affect how you
    are able to interact with other websites.  This could include the inability to login to services or
    programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.
