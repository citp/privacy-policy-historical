# Privacy Policy

Like you, we don't like people running off with our personal details so we promise not to sell, lease or otherwise transfer your information to anyone else, except where you've expressly asked us to (by entering a competition we're running jointly with another company for example).

We've tried to make our privacy policy nice and simple to understand, but if you're unsure what something means, or feel we could do a better job of explaining, please [get in touch and let us know](https://www.johnstonsofelgin.com/us/customer-assistance/contact-us "Click here to get in touch").
