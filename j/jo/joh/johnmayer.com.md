# John Mayer Privacy Policy

**PRIVACY POLICY**

Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on the Website as enjoyable and rewarding as possible.

Rodemode, Inc. (“Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information we receive via our Website (as defined in the Terms of Use available at  [http://www.johnmayer.com](http://johnmayer.com/terms-of-service)) from users of our Website (“Visitors”). This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Website. Your use of the Website following any such notice will signify and constitute your assent to and acceptance of such revised Privacy Policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, capitalized terms used herein have the same meanings as in our Terms of Use.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the products or services of our business partners or to any other third parties, even if their products or services are linked to, or embedded within, our Website.  We recommend that you review the privacy statements of the other parties with whom you interact before submitting your information.

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means information that can be used to uniquely identify you, such as your name, address and/or e-mail address.

**_Personal Information We Collect_**

When you interact with us, we may ask you to supply us with Personal Information.  For example, when you contact us, subscribe to our mailing list, or otherwise use our Website, we may ask you to provide information such as your name, address and/or e-mail address.

**_Our Use of Your Information_**

We mainly use your Personal Information, either alone or in combination with other information, so that we can provide, enhance and personalize our Website and related content, and marketing efforts.

The following are examples of a variety of ways that we may collect and use your Personal Information.

**Membership and Mailing List**. Visitors are asked to provide certain Personal Information when they register as a member on the Website and/or subscribe to our mailing list to receive newsletters and updates, including, their name and email address. When registering for membership Visitors are provided with an option to connect as a member of the Website using Facebook. In such case, we will have access to any publicly available Personal Information that a member connecting through Facebook has on his or her Facebook page. The Personal Information so collected from Visitors during this registration and/or subscription process is generally not shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or under the circumstances described below (see “Information Sharing and Disclosure” below). However, in instances where Company and a partner jointly promote the Website, Company may provide the partner certain Personal Information, such as the name and email of persons who registered as members or subscribed to the mailing list resulting from the joint promotion for the sole purpose of allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the promotion.  In this instance, Personal Information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose. Company may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from the Personal Information we collect from Visitors during registration and/or subscription (such as the total number, but not the names, of Visitors). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and Non-Identifying Information to sell advertisements that appear on the Website.

**Email Inquiries**.  When Visitors send email inquiries to Company, the Visitor’s return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive. Company does not use the Visitor’s return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party except as described in this Policy.

**Online Advertisements.** Company may display online advertisements. We may share Non-Identifying Information about our Visitors with these advertisers. Additionally, in some instances, we may use Non-Identifying Information to deliver tailored advertisements. For instance, an advertiser tells us the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the aggregated and Non-Identifying Information we have collected, we may then display the advertisement to the intended audience. Company does not share Personal Information about its Visitors with these advertisers.

**_Collection and Use of Non-Identifying Information_**

We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose information in a form that does not personally identify you (“Non-Identifying Information”) for any purpose.  Non-Identifying Information can include certain personally identifiable information that has been de-identified; that is, information that has been rendered anonymous. We and/or our third party service providers obtain Non-Identifying Information about you from information that you provide us, either separately or together with your Personal Information. We and/or our third party service providers also automatically collect certain Non-Identifying Information from you when you access our Website.

Certain Non-Identifying Information about you would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers in a way that enables you to be identified. However, the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other Non-Identifying information. We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other users or sources to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of our products and services, and to analyze and understand how our products and services are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically.

**_Non-Identifying Information We Automatically Collect  _**

We and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies, now and hereafter devised, that automatically record certain usage information. This information may include your Internet Protocol address (and other unique identifiers for the particular device you use to access the Internet), browser type, your web or application request, your interaction with our Website, your interaction with other websites and online services, the webpage or other feature you were using before you came to our Website, pages of our Website that you visit, information you search for via our Website, access times and dates, and other similar information. We use this information for a variety of purposes, including analyzing and enhancing our products and services, and to help personalize our Website for you. We do not treat this information as Personal Information (except to the extent required by local law), although if we combine it with the Personal Information you provide, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.  We and our third-party service providers may automatically collect Non-Identifying Information using various methods, including, without limitation, cookies.

**_Information Sharing and Disclosure.  _**

It is Company’s policy not to share the Personal Information we collect about Visitors in ways other than the ones described in this Privacy Policy without first obtaining such Visitors’ consent.

In addition to the types of information-sharing described above, Company may also disclose Personal Information about Visitors as follows:

We may engage third party companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf (e.g., without limitation, payment processing, software maintenance services, e-mail notifications, product delivery services, database management, web analytics and other services). These third parties may have access to your Personal Information.  If they do, this access is provided so that they may perform these tasks on our behalf and they are not authorized by us to otherwise use or disclose your Personal Information, except to the extent required by law.

In addition, we may share your Personal Information with participating sponsors to a program or promotion (e.g., a sweepstakes or contest) you enter via our Website, and with third parties who assist us in using the content or other information you have posted or shared with us via our Website (e.g., production companies we may use). Further, we may share your Personal Information with third parties such as our co-promotional partners and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships.

We also cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of us or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable.

Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, we may sell, transfer or otherwise disclose some or all of our assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. It’s Company’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.

**“Cookies” and How Company Uses Them**.  A “cookie” is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain websites. Company, and our third party service providers, may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information. If you are a Visitor and have signed up for our mailing list, news letters or updates, we may use a cookie. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your Personal Information in our databases. Additionally, be aware that if you visit non- Company websites, you may be required to accept cookies. Our advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them.

**Company’s Commitment to Children’s Privacy.** We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 via our Website, and do not target our Website to children under 13. We encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities and interests.

**Public Forums.** Please remember that any information you may disclose or submit to us, or display on other public areas of our Website or the Internet, becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose Personal Information in these public areas, as the protections described in the policy do not apply to that information.

**Company’s Commitment to Data Security**.  Our Website has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” from illegally obtaining this information.

**Changing or Deleting Your Information.   **Company makes good faith efforts to provide individuals with reasonable access to Personal Information that they have provided to Company and the reasonable ability to review and correct it or ask for deletion, as applicable, if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.  Please send any access, change, or deletion requests to us at the mailing address set forth below.  Please note we may retain server/backup copies of all data, and that we may decline to process change or deletion requests that we deem to be unreasonable, or require disproportionate technical effort, or jeopardize the privacy of others.

**Data Transfer _.   _**Company processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America.  Your Personal Information may be transferred to, and used by, entities located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.  If you are located outside of the United States, such export is a requirement of providing your information to Company.
