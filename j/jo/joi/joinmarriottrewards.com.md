**Information We Collect**

When we need to collect personally identifiable information from you to provide you with a particular service, we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need. For example, if you would like to make a reservation at one of our hotels, we will ask you for information such as name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number, Marriott Rewards number (if applicable), and room preference to process your reservation. We will use your email address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help in processing the reservation. We will also use your email address to 1) notify you about special offers and promotions as described in the [email section](https://web.archive.org/web/20041210093829id_/http%3A//www.marriott.com/privacy.mi?WT_Ref=mi_footer#Question11)  of this privacy statement, as well as 2) send you periodic satisfaction or market research surveys. You can [opt out](https://web.archive.org/profile/unsubscribe.mi) of emails at any time. The same types of information would be requested to complete a gift certificate purchase, register for a Marriott Rewards promotion, enter a sweepstakes, to enroll in the [Marriott Rewards program](https://web.archive.org/web/20041210093829id_/http%3A//www.marriott.com/privacy.mi?WT_Ref=mi_footer#Question4), or to redeem Marriott Rewards points.  On occasion, we use third parties to provide us with additional  contact information about you given the information you provided to us directly.  For example, if we know your name and postal address, we may use third party to provide us with your email address.  We would then use this information for market analysis and marketing purposes.

**Creating a Personal Account**

At your choice, you may create a personal account containing information such as your preferred Marriott hotel brands, frequently visited cities, interests (e.g., golf, tennis), and whether you travel with children or pets.  Creating a personal account makes it more convenient for you to make reservations by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter personal preference information.  It will allow us to inform you about special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you.  In addition, if you choose, you can include your credit card information in your account.  Your credit card information will be used for subsequent reservations to increase reservation speed and eliminate the need for you to repeatedly enter your credit card information.  The security of this information is addressed in security section below. 

You can access and review, update, or deactivate your personal account information online.  If you deactivate your personal account and are a Marriott Rewards member, all information not already required and stored as a condition of membership will be deleted.  If you are not a Marriott Rewards member and deactivate your personal account, the information you submitted to create the account will be deleted.

**Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information**

We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company's security procedures and policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. When we ask you for credit card data, it is transferred over a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) line, provided you are using a SSL enabled browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. We also use SSL on other select pages where you would enter personally identifiable information. This ensures that your information is encrypted as it travels over the Internet. This secure mode is enabled before any such information is transmitted from your computer. You will know you are in secure mode when the padlock or key icon in the lower right-hand or left-hand corner of the computer screen appears in the locked position.  In addition, when accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." 

After information reaches Marriott, it is stored on a secure server that resides behind firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of Marriott.  Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our hotels or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements.  Information collected on the sites covered by this privacy statement is generally processed and stored in the United States.

**Travel Related Services**

To provide you with a single source for purchasing packages that include other travel-related services such as airline tickets or rental cars, we have entered into agreements with select reputable third-party travel companies that aggregate inventory information from suppliers such as airlines and car rental companies.  If you desire to purchase a package that is facilitated through Marriott.com you will be linked to a Marriott-branded Web site that is hosted by the travel company.  If you choose to purchase a package, it is necessary for you to provide personally identifiable information to execute the purchase. This information is then provided to the suppliers (e.g., airlines) for processing.  We have entered into contracts with these third-party travel companies requiring that they secure your personally identifiable information as well as use it only to execute the transactions you request.  The same security and privacy commitments have been obtained from the suppliers.  However, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you have supplied directly to a supplier in any manner, in the past or in the future, is subject to their privacy statement and practices, for which Marriott has no responsibility.

**Disclosure of Information to Third Parties**

In addition to the travel-related services and required information sharing described directly above, Marriott does use the services of third parties, such as email service providers and marketing companies that act as agents on behalf of Marriott.  These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose Marriott specifies.  We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us.  We prohibit the sale or transfer of personally identifiable information to entities outside of the Marriott family of companies and hotels for their use without your approval.

**Cookies**

Our Website uses "cookie" technology. "Cookies" are encrypted strings of text that a Web site stores on a user's computer. Our Web site requires the use of a Cookie throughout the online reservation process. Without Cookies we will not be able to keep information you enter on multiple pages together. For example, unless Marriott.com can remember the dates you used in your hotel search, we will not be able to check room availability. Cookies also enable us to customize our Web site and offerings to your needs and provide you with a better online experience on Marriott.com. In addition, Cookies are used to: 

  * Allow registered users to sign in without typing their sign-in name each time

**Pixel Tags**

Marriott and its third-party service providers use pixel tags (also known as "clear gifs" "beacon gifs" etc.).  Pixel tags are not visible to the user of the site and consist of a few lines of computer coding delivered with the Web page.  Pixel tags are not used to collect any personally identifiable information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us in your dealings with Marriott.  Marriott and our email service provider use pixel tags to: 

  * Track customer response to Marriott advertisements and site content  

  * Determine your ability to receive HTML-based email messages.  Our email service provider includes a pixel tag, which they refer to as a "coded sensor" in all of the HTML-based messages sent on our behalf.  The sensor activates when the email message is opened and flags the email address of the user as one that is capable of receiving HTML-based email messages.  This capability helps our service provider to send the email in a format you can read.  The sensor does not collect or use any other information.  If you cannot receive HTML, you will not receive a functioning sensor 

  * Know how many users open an email and allow our service provider to compile aggregated statistics about an email campaign for us 

  * Allow us to better target interactive advertising, enhance customer support and site usability, and provide offers and promotions that we believe would be of interest to you
