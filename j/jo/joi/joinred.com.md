 _Information (RED) collects and how we use it_

### Personal Information

To fulfill its mission, (RED) depends on the participation of people just like you.  (RED)’s communications are designed to facilitate that participation through interaction, which often means asking people for their personal information and retaining that information on our systems. What follows is an explanation of the ways in which we ask for your personal information.

### GDPR Compliance

Where applicable, (RED) complies with EU data protection law when collecting, using, storing and otherwise processing your personal data (as defined in the EU General Data Protection Regulation  ((EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”)) and below is an overview of how (RED) complies with EU data protection law.   

  * Lawful Basis: (RED) has a legitimate interest in processing your personal information and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.

  * Categories of User: Key stakeholders, business partners, influencers, and other business contacts.

  * Legitimate Interest: Examples of the legitimate interest we have in processing your personal data include growing our business, interacting with key stakeholders, partners, and and managing our business communications.
