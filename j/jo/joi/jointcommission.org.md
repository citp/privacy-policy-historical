_**Cross-Border Data Transfers**_

We transfer Personal Information to jurisdictions as necessary for the purposes described above, including to jurisdictions that may not provide the same level of data protection as your home country. In particular, if you reside outside the United States ("US"), you should note that The Joint Commission is a controller that operates this Site in the US and therefore maintains Personal Information in the US. Regarding transfers from the European Economic Area ("EEA") to the United States, we rely on the derogations for transfers which are necessary to perform the transaction with you and other grounds. We also implement standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, and other appropriate solutions to address cross-border transfers as required or permitted by Articles 46 and 49 of the General Data Protection Regulation. Where required by law, you may request a copy of the suitable mechanisms we have in place by contacting us as detailed below. If you reside in other non-US jurisdictions outside the EEA, your use of the Site or provision of any Personal Information constitutes your consent for the transfer of such data to the United States for the purposes identified above.  If you have questions about cross-border transfers, please contact us as detailed below. You may also have rights to contact your local supervisory with any questions.

_**Other Issues**_

_(i) What is the legal basis of processing?_

Some jurisdictions require an explanation of the legal basis for the collection and processing of Personal Information. We have several different legal grounds on which we collect and process Personal Information, including: (a) as necessary to perform a transaction (such as when we respond to your requests); (b) as necessary to comply with a legal obligation (such as when we use Personal Information for record keeping to substantiate tax liability); (c) consent (where you have provided consent as appropriate under applicable law); and (d) necessary for legitimate interests (such as when we act to maintain our business generally). With respect to legitimate interests, given that we are a B2B company, we typically collect and process limited Personal Information about customer contacts and other individuals acting in their business capacities, as part of our overall effort to reduce the privacy impact on individuals. 

_(ii) What are the consequences of not providing Personal Information?_

You are not required to provide all Personal Information identified in this Privacy & Cookies Statement to use our Sites or to interact with us offline, but certain functionality will not be available if you do not provide Personal Information. If you do not provide Personal Information, we may not be able to respond to your request, perform a transaction with you, or provide you with marketing that we believe you would find valuable. 

_(iii) Do we engage in automated decision-making without human intervention?_

We do not use automated decision-making without human intervention, including profiling, in a way that produces legal effects concerning you or otherwise significantly affects you.

_(iv) Do the Sites honor do not track ("DNT") signals sent via browsers?  _

Given the divergent practices of organizations that offer browsers and the lack of a standard in the marketplace, we generally do not respond to DNT signals at this time.

_(v) How long do we retain Personal Information?_

We typically retain Personal Information related to marketing activities for as long as you accept marketing communications from us, and we will securely delete such data in accordance with applicable law upon request. For Personal Information that we collect and process for other purposes, we typically retain such Personal Information for no longer than for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy & Cookies Statement and as otherwise specified in applicable record retention policies and procedures. 

_(vi) Are third party websites governed by this  Privacy & Cookies Statement?_

This Site contains links and references to other websites administered by unaffiliated third parties. This Privacy & Cookies Statement does not apply to such third party websites. When you click a link to visit a third party websites, you will be subject to that websites' privacy practices. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy and security practices of the linked third party websites before providing any Personal Information on that websites.

_(vii) How does the Company handle employee and contractor privacy issues?_

Personal Data about our employees and contractors are addressed through internal company policies and procedures, and are outside the scope of this Privacy & Cookies Statement.

_(viii) How will we handle any changes to this  Privacy & Cookies Statement?_

We will review our Privacy & Cookies Statement on a regular, periodic basis, but may also update when and if our services and/or privacy practices change.
