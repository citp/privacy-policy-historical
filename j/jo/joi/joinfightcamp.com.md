In particular, we use the information we collect to:

  * If you contact us when you are already logged in to your FightCamp account, the web or in-app form automatically prefills your name and email address, so you do not have to type it in manually.

## What Information We Share

We do not rent, sell, or share your Personal Information with other people or non-affiliated third parties, except with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide the FightCamp Service or any specific service you have requested or authorized. We currently do not share personal data with third parties for their direct marketing purposes without your consent.

To help us do our work, we may provide limited access to some of your Personal Information to the following third parties:

  *  **Collaborating Organizations:** Sometimes we collaborate closely with other groups to further our mission. In these cases, we may share your name, contact information and other details you provided when making an account with our partners.
  *  **Affiliated Third Parties:** We may share our subscriber list, which include Members' names, email addresses, postal addresses, phone numbers, social media IDs, comments, and action history, with our affiliates or subsidiaries.
  *  **Service Providers:** We work with a wide range of third party providers, notably our database administrators, cloud computing services, advertising services, data analysts, application service providers, bulk SMS services, and other non-governmental organizations. We do not authorize them to use or disclose your Personal Information except in connection with providing their services to Hykso.
  *  **Payment processors:** We do not view or store credit card information. We work with payment processors such as Stripe to help process credit card transactions and other payment methods made through the Site or FightCamp Service. These payment processors will store certain information about you. Please refer to their privacy policies to learn more about how they use your Personal Information. We do store your shipping address, so we can process your order for the Hykso Devices or other products through our fulfillment partner. If you are signed into your FightCamp account when you purchase a product or service on our Site or through the App, we will associate that order with your FightCamp account.



We may also transfer your Personal Information to a third party as a result of a merger, acquisition, reorganization or similar transaction; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of the Site, App or FightCamp Service; and to protect the rights or property of Hykso. In such event, and to the extent legally permitted, we will notify you and, if there are material changes in relation to the processing of your Personal Information, give you an opportunity to consent to such changes.

We will also share Personal Information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Hykso if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of your Personal Information is reasonably necessary to (1) detect or protect against fraud or security issues, to enforce our Terms, (2) meet any enforceable government request, (3) defend against legal claims, or protect against harm our legal rights or safety, or that of our staff and/or Members.

## How We Use Tracking Technologies, such as Cookies, Web Beacons and Tracking Pixels

We, or third parties we do business with, may use certain technologies to automatically collect log files and other information about your usage of, and the devices you use to access, the Site, App and the FightCamp Service (" **Tracking Technologies** "). For example, we may use Tracking Technologies like cookies, log files, web beacons, session replay scripts, or similar technologies to help us analyze our web page and in-application user flow, customize our services, content and advertising, measure promotional effectiveness and promote trust and safety.

We want to be open about our cookie use. Even if you are only browsing the Site, certain information (including computer and connection information, browser type and version, operating system and platform details, and the time of accessing the Site) is automatically collected about you through cookies. This information will be collected every time you access the Site or FightCamp Service and it will be used for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.

You can reduce the information cookies collected from your device. An easy way of doing this is often to change the settings in your browser. You may delete and block all cookies from our Site or FightCamp Service, but parts of the Site or FightCamp Service may not work. If you do that you should know that (a) your use of the Site or FightCamp Service may be adversely affected (and possibly entirely prevented), (b) your experience of this and other sites that use cookies to enhance or personalize your experience may be adversely affected, and (c) you may not be presented with advertising that reflects the way that you use our and other sites.

By using the Site, you consent to this, unless you change your browser settings.

Web beacons, tracking pixels and similar Tracking Technologies may be used to track the traffic patterns of users from one page to another in order to maximize traffic flow.

## How We Secure Your Personal Information

We take reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, misuse, or destruction. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. The safety and security of your Personal Information also depends on you.
