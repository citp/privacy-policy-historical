# Privacy Policy | Handshake

_Last updated and effective as of: May 25, 2018_

Welcome to Handshake, a career services platform that connects students and employers to democratize the job finding experience, in college and beyond. From the very beginning, our goal has been to design privacy into our platform in a way that respects the rights of students, the obligations of Universities, and the needs of employers. We understand that student data privacy is a hot topic these days so we want to make clear the very basic privacy principles that guide our policies and practices: 

  * **Students are in complete control of what data they make public.** We give students control over whether they want to make their profile public to employers and what information they share on it. No student data uploaded to Handshake is ever viewable by any employer until a student has chosen to make their profile public. 
  * **Universities choose the student data they share with Handshake.** We respect the rights of students regarding their own personal data, and we are proud to work with Universities to find the best ways to maximize their career center’s value without compromising student privacy. 
  * **Handshake will never sell personal student data.** We have never done it and we never will! Our business model is based on offering valuable tools for our student and employer users that enhance the career discovery process. Your email address and personal data will never be sold to any third party. 



You should read our full Privacy Policy to understand what data we collect, how we use it, and the limited circumstances where we may share it. Please note if that you reside in the EU or other regions outside the US, information collected through our Service will be transferred to and processed in the US or elsewhere. While Handshake participates in the EU/US Privacy Shield program as described below, these locations may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially used our Services. By using our Services, you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with this Policy. If you have any questions, please contact us at privacy@joinhandshake.com. 

We are a career services platform that connects students, schools and employers to democratize the job finding experience in college and beyond. 

This Privacy Policy applies to your use of the joinhandshake.com website and the Handshake Service (collectively “the Handshake Service” or “the Service”), as well as your relationship with Stryder Corp. (“Handshake”).This policy is part of Handshake’s [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/tos/). By using our Service, you agree to both our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/tos/) and this Privacy Policy; if you do not agree, please do not use the Service. 

This Privacy Policy may change over time. If we make minor changes to it without materially changing your rights, we will post the modified Policy on our website. We will notify you by email, through the Handshake Service, or by presenting you with a new Privacy Policy to accept if we make a modification that materially changes your rights. When you use the Handshake Service after a modification is posted, you are telling us that you accept the modified terms. 

We collect personal and non-personal data from you when you use our Services. Personal Data is data that includes a personal identifier like your name, email or address, phone number, or is data that could reasonably be linked back to you. 

You need to have an account to use Handshake. You can create an account on Handshake as a student seeking a job or career advice or as an employer looking for exciting new talent. You may also create an account as a career center or school employee or as an invited mentor. 

**Student or Alumni Data:** We receive personal data about you when you create a Student or Alumni Account, update your profile, respond to questions or surveys on our website or otherwise use our Site, from our Partner Universities, and from other third party data sources. 

**From University Partners:** Our University Partners share information about their students with us so we can provide them with services that they use to manage their career centers. Each University Partner chooses what it shares, which may include your name, mailing and email address, major, or GPA. Where FERPA applies to data shared by University Partners, it is stored, used and shared in compliance with the statute. 

**From You, Your Account and Your Profile:** You can choose to share additional information with us, such as an updated email address, phone number, work experience, resume and transcript, and answers to questions about your interests and activities that will be covered by this Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/tos/). You can also share this information by updating your profile, uploading documents that include personal information, or answering questions or surveys (such as the First Destination Survey) we email you or present to you on the Services. We will not use your phone number to send any commercial or marketing messages to you. 

**From Employer Reviews:** We receive any personal information you choose to include in submitted employer reviews. Handshake collects this information even if the review is not published or made public. 

**From Third Parties:** We may receive additional information about you from other schools, alumni or career counseling organizations, or from other sources. 

**Usage and Log Data:** When you visit the Site, we log and store your IP Address and technical information about your visit like your browser type and how you progressed through the Site, where you abandoned it, etc. (“Usage Data”). We can use your IP address to determine your general location. 

**Mobile Data:** When you use the Handshake mobile app, we collect analytic information about your device, such as IP address, OS version, and clickstream. 

**Precise Location Data:** For a limited set of features, we allow users to opt-in to our collection of precise location data (GPS data). We only use this information to enable these features, such as displaying your precise location on a map at a career fair. We do not share precise location data with third parties, and we do not combine precise location data with personal information for advertising purposes. 

**Employer Data:** When Employers create a Handshake Employer Account, we request contact information, including email address and telephone number, to provide a point of contact for Universities and administrative staff and which is made available on your public profile. We will not use your phone number to send any commercial or marketing messages not related to your use of Handshake Services to you without your express consent. 

We use, process and store your Personal Data to provide the Handshake Service and to maximize opportunities to connect you with potential employers. This includes: 

  * Providing services such as allowing you to make appointments with career center professionals or sign up for career fairs and other events.
  * Delivering job opportunities and communications from potential employers by email in accordance with your account settings and communication preferences.
  * Allowing you to choose whether your profile is public or private, so potential employers, or others, can find you--or not. 
  * Allowing you to contact employers and employers to contact you.
  * Allowing you to post reviews and other content on employers and employment experiences.
  * Personalizing the Service. For example, we may suggest employers to you based on the information in your resume or the demographic information you provide or suggest students with public profiles to employers based on search criteria.
  * Contacting you about additional Handshake or Partner services you might be interested in, unless you opt-out (see “How to Opt-Out of Email Communications”).
  * Researching new ways to improve the Handshake Service.
  * Using FERPA protected data only in compliance with the requirements of the statute.



We will only share your personal data with third parties under the following circumstances: 

  * With your consent. For example, you may choose to make your profile public so that we can share it with employers through the Services or choose to apply to a job and we will share your profile information, resume and transcript with the employers you choose. You may also choose to make your profile public to specific audiences to help grow your professional brand and network. When posting an employer review or other related content, you may choose to publish your name and profile alongside the content publicly. You may also choose to post the content without any directly identifying information (i.e. you may post “pseudonymously”). Please note, even when posting pseudonymously, it may be possible to infer your identity from the content, and we share the identities of both public and pseudonymous content with Universities.
  * With vendors that are contractually engaged to provide us with services, such as order fulfillment, email management and credit card processing. These companies are obligated by contract to safeguard any personal data they receive from us.
  * If we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, valid legal process (e.g., subpoenas or warrants served on us), or governmental or regulatory request, to enforce or apply the [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/tos/), to protect the security or integrity of the Handshake Service, and/or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Handshake, its employees, users, or others. If we are going to release your data, we will do our best to provide you with notice in advance by email, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so.
  * We may disclose or transfer your personal data in connection with the sale, merger, bankruptcy, sale of assets or reorganization of our company. We will notify you if a different company will receive your personal data and the promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your data as transferred to the new entity



Non-personal data is data that itself cannot reasonably be linked back to you or data that is combined with other data in a way that cannot reasonably be linked back to you. We use and share your non-personal, de-identified or aggregated data in a variety of ways to help our Partners and the public understand trends in the job seeking market through analytics reports, statistics and other metrics and guides. For example, to understand: 

  * What percentage of students from certain colleges work in a specific geographic area.
  * Whether a certain major or extra-curricular activity fits well with a particular employer’s hiring patterns.
  * How employers compare to each other in the number of applicants they receive from different colleges.

Handshake provides the ability for employers to pay schools for collateral expenses, such as hosting a booth at a career fair, through the use of a third party payment processor.

Handshake claims no responsibility or liability for payment transactions.
