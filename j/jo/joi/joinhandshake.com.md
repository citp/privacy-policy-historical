# Privacy Policy | Handshake

_Last updated and effective as of: May 8, 2017_

We are a career services platform that connects students, schools and employers to democratize the job finding experience in college and beyond. 

Privacy Policy applies to your use of the joinhandshake.com website and the Handshake Service (collectively “the Handshake Service” or “the Service”), as well as your relationship with Stryder Corp. (“Handshake”, “Handshake”).This policy is part of Handshake’s [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/tos/). By using our Service, you agree to both our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/tos/) and this Privacy Policy; if you do not agree, please do not use the Service. 

This Privacy Policy may change over time. If we make minor changes to it without materially changing your rights, we will post the modified Policy on our website. We will notify you by email, through the Handshake Service, or by presenting you with a new Privacy Policy to accept if we make a modification that materially changes your rights. When you use the Handshake Service after a modification is posted, you are telling us that you accept the modified terms. 

We collect personal and non-personal data from you when you use our Services. Personal Data is data that includes a personal identifier like your name, email or address, phone number, or is data that could reasonably be linked back to you. 

You need to have an account to use Handshake. You can create an account on Handshake as a student seeking a job or career advice or as an employer looking for exciting new talent. You may also create an account as a career center or school employee or volunteer or as an invited mentor. 

**Student or Alumni Data:** We receive personal data about you when you create a Student or Alumni Account, update your profile, respond to questions or surveys on our website or otherwise use our Site, from our Partner Universities, and from other third party data sources. 

**From University Partners:** Our University Partners share information about their students with us so we can provide them with services that they use to manage their career centers. Each University Partner chooses what it shares, which may include your name, mailing and email address, major, or GPA. Where FERPA applies to data shared by university partners, it is stored, used and shared in compliance with the statute. 

**From You, Your Account and Your Profile:** You can choose to share additional information with us, such as an updated email address, phone number, work experience, resume and transcript, and answers to questions about your interests and activities that will be covered by this Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/tos/). You can also share this information by updating your profile, uploading documents that include personal information, or answering questions or surveys (such as the First Destination Survey) we email you or present to you on the Services. We will not use your phone number to send any commercial or marketing messages to you. 

**From Third Parties:** We may receive additional information about you from other schools, alumni or career counseling organizations, or from other sources. 

**Usage and Log Data:** When you visit the Site, we log and store your IP Address and technical information about your visit like your browser type and how you progressed through the Site, where you abandoned it, etc. (“Usage Data”). We can use your IP address to determine your general location. 

**Employer Data:** When Employers create a Handshake Employer Account, we request contact information, including email address and telephone number, to provide a point of contact for Universities and administrative staff and which is made available on your public profile. We will not use your phone number to send any commercial or marketing messages not related to your use of Handshake Services to you without your express consent. 

We use your Personal Data to provide the Handshake Service and to maximize opportunities to connect you with potential employers. This includes: 

  * Providing services such as allowing you to make appointments with career center professionals or sign up for career fairs and other events. 
  * Allowing you to opt-in to make your profile public so potential employers, or others can find you. 
  * Allowing you to contact employers and employers to contact you. 
  * Personalizing the Service. For example, we may suggest employers to you based on the information in your resume or the demographic information you provide or suggest students with public profiles to employers based on employers search criteria. 
  * Contacting you about additional Handshake or Partner services you might be interested in, unless you opt-out (see “Opting out of Marketing messages”). 
  * Researching new ways to improve the Handshake Service. 
  * Using FERPA protected data only in compliance with the requirements of the statute. 



We will only share your personal data with third parties under the following circumstances: 

  * With your consent. For example, you may consent to make your profile public so that we can share it with employers through the Services or choose to apply to a job and we will share your profile information, resume and transcript with the employers you choose. 
  * With companies that are contractually engaged in providing us with services, such as order fulfillment, email management and credit card processing. These companies are obligated by contract to safeguard any personal data they receive from us. 
  * If we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, valid legal process (e.g., subpoenas or warrants served on us), or governmental or regulatory request, to enforce or apply the [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/tos/), to protect the security or integrity of the Handshake Service, and/or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Handshake, its employees, users, or others. If we are going to release your data, we will do our best to provide you with notice in advance by email, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so. 
  * We may disclose or transfer your personal data in connection with the sale, merger, bankruptcy, sale of assets or reorganization of our company. We will notify you if a different company will receive your personal data and the promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your data as transferred to the new entity. 



Non personal data is data that itself cannot reasonably be linked back to you or data that is combined with other data in a way that cannot reasonably be linked back to you. We use and share your non personal, de-identified or aggregated data in a variety of ways to help our Partners and the public understand trends in the job seeking market through analytics reports, statistics and other metrics and guides. For example, to understand: 

  * What percentages of students from certain colleges work in a specific geographic area. 
  * Whether a certain major or extra-curricular activity fits well with a particular employer’s hiring patterns. 
  * How employers compare to each other in the number of applicants they receive from different colleges. 



As a Site visitor, we place a small piece of software referred to as a “session cookie” on your computer. If you use the Services and create an account, we also use this cookie to recognize you on return visits and expedite the login process. You can remove this and other cookies through your browser preferences menu, though the exact method varies depending on the type of browser you use – but note that you won’t be able to log into our service if your cookies are disabled. If you visit from a mobile device, we may reference your device identifier or other information about where your visit originated. 

Our email communications contain web beacons or similar technology which track when the email has been opened or read. This functionality sends the resulting records back to our Service, which may be associated with other information you have provided us. 

To stop receiving notifications or promotions, please click the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of each email or update your account preferences. 

We use industry standard technical, administrative and physical controls to protect your data including encrypting it at rest and as it is transferred from you to Handshake. While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches, no website or internet transmission is completely secure and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss or other breach will never occur. In the event of a breach, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and, where appropriate, notify affected individuals in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations. 

We are currently unable to respond to Do Not Track signals that may be sent by some browsers. 

You can choose to deactivate your account so that you are no longer viewable on the Service or you can make your account private. You may also request Handshake delete information about you, however we may be obligated as a service provider to your college or university to retain certain data about you. You can do this by sending a message to “support@joinhandshake.com” requesting such deactivation or deletion. 

The Services may contain links to and from third party websites of our Employer and University Partners or other Handshake Partners. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for their policies. We also cannot be responsible for your personal data that you submit to employers using the Services. Please check their individual policies before you submit any information to those websites. 

Minors under 18 are not permitted to use our Site without express parental consent to both use the Services and be bound by our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/tos/) and this Policy. We do not intentionally collect information from minors under 13. If you believe we have collected any personal information from a child younger than 13 years of age, please notify us immediately at support@joinhandshake.com and we will take reasonable measures to remove that information from our systems. 

Handshake provides the ability for employers to pay schools for collateral expenses, such as hosting a booth at a career fair, through the use of a third party payment processor. Handshake does not collect or use any of that payment information. If an employer has any conflicts regarding the method of payment acceptance, they should contact the school. Handshake claims no responsibility or liability for payment transactions.
