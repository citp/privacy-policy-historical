# Privacy | Honey

## Privacy and Security Policy

### Last updated: May 25, 2018

### Letter from our founders

As users of the internet, we care about privacy just like you. And as fellow human beings, we think you deserve to know exactly what you can expect from your Honey experience. Before you read our privacy policy, we’d first like to tell you how we think about privacy in simple terms.We do not sell personal information about anyone who uses our services. Ever. That wouldn’t be fair.We created Honey in 2012 because the existing model for online shopping doesn’t work well for most people. People shop in isolation, spend countless hours searching for good deals and never know if they’re getting the best deal.So we decided to build a community that uses the collective insights of our users and members to power tools that allow everyone to shop smarter, together. Similar to applications that enable commuters to cut through traffic and save time, which are powered by their users and members providing information about speed and congestion, Honey users and members share real-time information with the rest of the community and help everyone save time and money in the process.Want to know which promo code works? Sure, another member just tested all of the codes with Honey five minutes ago. Want to see when a product you’re interested in goes on sale? Another Honey member is helping us update the price right now. When shoppers hunt for deals together, rather than on their own, everyone saves time and money. Everybody wins.We understand this community network approach isn’t for everyone and that’s okay. We think the vast majority of our users and members will see the value of sharing things like successful promo codes and price drops with each other and will learn first-hand how it helps everyone save a lot of time and money. But, it’s up to you, and we give you the choice to opt out at any time.Our stance on privacy is simple: We will be transparent with what data we collect and how we use it to save you time and money, and you can decide if you’re good with that.If this sounds fair, then let’s start shopping smarter, together.George Ruan

That includes the type of devices you use, your device’s unique IDs where available or set, your IP address, your operating system, the type of browsers you use, URLs and domain names, how you engage with websites you visit when using Honey’s products, error logs, and other similar information. This information also allows us to upgrade and improve your experience.

  * We take our users’ and our members’ time seriously and always want to make sure that any communication or service we provide is useful and relevant. It is in this spirit and scope that we also collect information which allows us to know whether you took an action from our communications. To do that we use common digital tools that allow us to see if you opened an email or visited a link we sent.
  * We are always happy to help our users and members when you reach out with questions. The information we collect during that process is used to better improve Honey’s products and the experience of our users and members.

Our goal is to save people time and money by using the shopping experience and data of our users and members to create better tools and products.
