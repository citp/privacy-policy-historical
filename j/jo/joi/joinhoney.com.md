## Privacy and Security Policy

### Last updated: January 16, 2017

### Introduction

So... we’re going to try to take a different approach here and write in the most open and honest way we can about what we do and what we believe at Honey. Hopefully this will create an open dialogue about how we use your data to help negotiate the best possible deals we can. If you have any questions or comments, we are always listening at [privacy@joinhoney.com](mailto:privacy@joinhoney.com).

### The Privacy Policy

This privacy policy governs your use of the software tools (“the Service”) developed by Honey Science Corporation (“Honey” or “we”). These tools presently include Honey (“the Extension”) for desktop web browsers, and Honey (“the Website”) the website (located at [www.joinhoney.com](https://web.archive.org/)). We built the Service to help our users efficiently save time and money by locating deals on the products and services they are most interested in.

### What information does the Service obtain and how is it used?

User Provided InformationThe Service obtains information you directly provide when you optionally register as a member of the Service. Registration with us is required in order to be able to use some, but not all, features of the Service. When registration is required to use a feature you will be prompted to log in or to create an account if you have not already done so.  
When you register with us and use the Service, you are generally asked to provide your name, email address, username, password and other registration information. As you continue to use the Service, using many features will create additional User Provided Information such as when you comment on a deal. Additionally when you contact us for help or enter other information into our systems it is collected to help provide the Service to you.From time to time we may contact you to provide you with important information, required notices and marketing promotions. As a general operating principle we will try to build the option to limit any excessive communications that many people could find annoying while continuing to build the best possible service for our members.Automatically Collected InformationIn addition, in order to safely provide the features available in the Service we also collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of devices you use, your device’s unique device IDs where available or set, the IP address of your device, your operating system, the type of browsers you use, how you engage with websites you visit using the Service, non-personal data extracted from third party websites, and information about the way you use the Service such as when you click on the Honey button to apply coupon codes automatically during checkout.Where possible we work to make settings available to you as a member to control which features are available and the information required for us to provide each.

### What information does the Service NOT obtain?

Your privacy and security is very important to us. There are many types of information that the Service does NOT collect. For example, we do not collect any information from your email, bank or credit card accounts. We do not record personal information that you have not provided to us directly or explicitly given us permission to record.As a general principle, when you use the Extension we are careful to only run our software on websites where we can provide value to you as a Honey member as a result of our software being enabled.

### Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Service?

We will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.We may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:

  * as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;
  * when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;

### Honey Exclusive Offers and Advertising

We work with merchants to make exclusive offers (“Exclusive Offers”) available to you as a Honey member that are often better than those that are available to the general public. In some cases your eligibility for some of these Exclusive Offers is based in whole or in part upon data we or our merchant partners collect. When Honey User Provided or Automatically Collected Information is used for Exclusive Offer qualification no personally identifying information is ever transferred to the merchant partner.In some cases an action is required by you in order to claim an Exclusive Offer such as by clicking on a “claim” button presented in our software. Claiming an offer does not guarantee it will be available when you check out as there may be additional requirements from our merchant partner to successfully redeem an offer, including tracking your purchase through to delivery. When you claim an offer we will make a commercially reasonable effort to ensure that the offer remains available but do not make any specific guarantees as we and our merchant partners rely on numerous third party systems employing a mix of technologies including cookies to track results. Your use of other software including adblockers or other affiliate or offer programs provided by other third parties can also interfere with this tracking in which case you may no longer be eligible for the Exclusive Offer. If you encounter problems redeeming an offer please contact us at [info@joinhoney.com](mailto:info@joinhoney.com) and we will try to help resolve your problem.
