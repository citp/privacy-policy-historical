    </p>
    <p>
      Welcome to Handshake, a career services platform that connects students and employers to democratize the job finding experience,
      in college and beyond. From the very beginning, our goal has been to design privacy into our platform in a way that
      respects the rights of students, the obligations of Universities, and the needs of employers. We understand that student
      data privacy is a hot topic these days so we want to make clear the very basic privacy principles that guide our policies
      and practices:
    </p>
    <p>
      </p><ul>
        <li>
          <b>Students are in complete control of what data they make public. </b>
          We give students control over whether they want to make their profile public to employers and what information they share
          on it. No student data uploaded to Handshake is ever viewable by any employer until a student has chosen to make
          their profile public.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Universities choose the student data they share with Handshake. </b>
          We respect the rights of students regarding their own personal data, and we are proud to work with Universities to find the
          best ways to maximize their career center’s value without compromising student privacy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Handshake will never sell personal student data. </b>
          We have never done it and we never will! Our business model is based on offering valuable tools for our student and employer
          users that enhance the career discovery process. Your email address and personal data will never be sold to any
          third party.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      You should read our full Privacy Policy to understand what data we collect, how we use it, and the limited circumstances
      where we may share it. Please note if that you reside in the EU or other regions outside the US, information collected
      through our Service will be transferred to and processed in the US or elsewhere. While Handshake participates in the
      EU/US Privacy Shield program as described below, these locations may not have the same data protection laws as the
      country in which you initially used our Services. By using our Services, you consent to any transfer and processing
      in accordance with this Policy. If you have any questions, please contact us at privacy@joinhandshake.com.

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may change over time. If we make minor changes to it without materially changing your rights, we will
      post the modified Policy on our website. We will notify you by email, through the Handshake Service, or by presenting
      you with a new Privacy Policy to accept if we make a modification that materially changes your rights. When you use

      We will only share your personal data with third parties under the following circumstances:
    </p>

    <p>
      </p><ul>
        <li>With your consent. For example, you may choose to make your profile public so that we can share it with employers
          through the Services or choose to apply to a job and we will share your profile information, resume and transcript
          with the employers you choose. You may also choose to make your profile public to specific audiences to help grow
          your professional brand and network. When posting an employer review or other related content, you may choose to
          publish your name and profile alongside the content publicly. You may also choose to post the content without any
          directly identifying information (i.e. you may post “pseudonymously”). Please note, even when posting pseudonymously,
          it may be possible to infer your identity from the content, and we share the identities of both public and pseudonymous
          content with Universities.</li>
        <li>With vendors that are contractually engaged to provide us with services, such as order fulfillment, email management
          and credit card processing. These companies are obligated by contract to safeguard any personal data they receive
          from us.</li>
        <li>If we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, valid legal process (e.g.,
          subpoenas or warrants served on us), or governmental or regulatory request, to enforce or apply the
          <a href="/tos/">Terms of Service</a>, to protect the security or integrity of the Handshake Service, and/or to protect the rights,
          property, or safety of Handshake, its employees, users, or others. If we are going to release your data, we will
          do our best to provide you with notice in advance by email, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so.</li>
        <li>We may disclose or transfer your personal data in connection with the sale, merger, bankruptcy, sale of assets or
          reorganization of our company. We will notify you if a different company will receive your personal data and the
          promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your data as transferred to the new entity</li>

    </h2>

    <p>
      Non-personal data is data that itself cannot reasonably be linked back to you or data that is combined with other data in

      data in a variety of ways to help our Partners and the public understand trends in the job seeking market through analytics
      reports, statistics and other metrics and guides. For example, to understand:

        <li>Whether a certain major or extra-curricular activity fits well with a particular employer’s hiring patterns.</li>
