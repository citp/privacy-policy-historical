When you register to receive any products or services from Reboot or provide information to Reboot in any other manner, you agree to provide only true, accurate, current and complete information.

_Non-Personal Information_

Non-Personal Information about your use of the Reboot web site and your use of other web sites is collected through the use of Cookies and Web Beacons. “Cookies” are small data files that are stored on the hard drive of the computer you use to view a web site. Every computer that accesses the Reboot web site is assigned a unique cookie by Reboot. “Web Beacons” are graphic image files imbedded in a web page typically used to monitor activity on a web page and send back to its home server (which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser or some other third party) information from your browser, such as the IP address, the URL of the page on which the Web Beacon is located, the type browser that is accessing the site and the ID number of any Cookies on your computer previously placed by that server.

In addition, third parties under contract with Reboot may use Cookies or Web Beacons to collect Non-Personal Information about your usage of the Reboot web site. These third party advertising service providers may use this information, on our behalf, to help Reboot deliver advertising on the Reboot web site as well as on other sites on the Internet based on your browsing activity on our sites. Reboot may further tailor the advertising on these third party sites based on additional Non-Personal Information to the extent known by Reboot or these third parties.

_Social Networking Sites_

If you choose to use any third party website or service that is integrated with Reboot, such as Facebook, Google+ or Twitter ( _“Social Networking Sites”_ ), we may receive Personal Information from such Social Networking Sites, including, but not limited to:

  * Name
  * Nickname or Username
  * Photo or Graphic Avatar
  * Unique Third Party Website Identifier (e.g., Facebook User ID)
  * Biographical or Demographic Information (e.g. professional title, gender, college attended, etc.)
  * Likes and Interests
  * Contacts / Friends / Associations
  * Any Information that Is Publicly Available on Third Party Websites



Reboot offers the ability to use certain Social Networking Sites to facilitate your registration on Reboot. We may also use information about your profile and connections on Social Networking Sites to allow you to share or connect with your friends and contacts on Reboot or to personalize your experience.

Your decision to use, or share with, a Social Networking Site when accessing or using the Reboot web site is completely voluntary. Reboot is not responsible for compliance with the policies or practices of any Social Networking Site. You should ensure that you are comfortable with the information such Social Networking Sites may make available to Reboot by reviewing those Social Networking Sites’ privacy policies and service terms, and by modifying your privacy settings and preferences on those web sites accordingly.

Any information we receive from Social Networking Sites will be governed by this Privacy Policy.

_Reboot Apps_

When you download and install a Reboot App onto your mobile device we assign a random number to your App installation. This number cannot be used to identify you personally, and we cannot identify you personally unless you choose to become a registered user of a Reboot App. We use this random number in a manner similar to our use of Cookies as described above. Unlike Cookies, the random number is assigned to your installation of an App itself and not a browser, because Apps do not work through your browser. If you do not want us to use the random number for the purposes for which we use Cookies, please do not use any Reboot Apps and please use your mobile device browser to access the Reboot web site or our mobile optimized sites. We do not obtain any information about your mobile device other than the brand, make and model and type of operating software your device uses.

_Analytics Services_

Reboot uses third party analytics providers and products to obtain, compile and analyze information (that may include Personal Information) about how users are using and interacting with the Reboot web site. Reboot may provide information (including Personal Information) to these analytics providers for the purpose of obtaining statistics and other information about how users are using and interacting with the Reboot web site. These analytics providers may use tracking techniques other than Cookies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect or compile this information. These techniques may be used directly on the Reboot web site. Reboot has no responsibility for the technologies, tools or practices of the third parties that provide analytics products and services to Reboot. Please be aware that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these techniques, and that browser settings that block conventional Cookies may have no effect on such techniques.

_Non-Personal Information Collected by Third Parties Not Acting on Reboot’s Behalf_

We work with third parties to display advertising that reflects the interests and preferences of our users. Sponsors or advertisers on the Reboot web site may use their own Cookies, Web Beacons or other online tracking technologies in the banner advertisements served on the Reboot web site and in emails, special promotions, Daily Posts or Newsletters we send you. Their advertisements may be displayed on the Reboot web site or on other sites that you visit after you visit the Reboot web site. Some advertisers use companies other than Reboot to serve their ads and to monitor users’ responses to ads, and these companies (“Ad Servers”) may also collect Non-Personal Information through the use of Cookies or Web Beacons on the Reboot web site.

We do not control how third parties use Cookies or Web Beacons or how they manage the Non-Personal Information they gather through the use of these technologies on the Reboot web site. However, we do require sponsors, advertisers and Ad Servers who collect Cookie or Web Beacon information through the Reboot web site to agree that they will not collect any Personal Information from the Reboot web site without your consent. They have promised us they will not link any Non-Personal Information collected by them on the Reboot web site to Personal Information they or others collect in other ways or from other sites.

_Personal Health Information_

In connection with certain services offered by Reboot, we may request information regarding your health history. To the extent we collect any personal health information, we will comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to the privacy and security requirements for such information. While we will work to maintain the privacy of all health information that you may provide to us, Reboot is currently not subject to the privacy and security requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) or any other laws applicable to medical professionals and health care providers (or other “covered entities”).

**How We Use Your Information**

We may use information we collect about you to:

  * Administer your account
  * Provide you with access to particular services
  * Respond to your inquiries and send you communications
  * Obtain your feedback on our sites and our offerings
  * Statistically analyze user behavior and activity
  * Provide you with more relevant content and advertisements
  * Conduct research and measurement activities
  * Send you personalized emails or secure electronic messages pertaining to your interests, including news, announcements, reminders and opportunities



_Use of Personal Information_

We use the information we obtain from you to provide Reboot products and services, fulfill your requests, improve our products and services, personalize and tailor your experience on our web site, operate our business, and understand how users are engaging with Reboot. In addition, we may use information from you to facilitate the delivery of content or advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you, or to communicate with you about new or existing products and services or special offers.

Reboot does not make your Personal Information available to third parties for marketing purposes.

_Use of Non-Personal Information_

We may combine Personal and Non-Personal Information about you, and may combine this information with information from external sources. Third parties may also use Non-Personal Information in order to display advertising that reflects the interests and preferences of our users.

We also use Cookies in order to conduct surveys for our own use and on behalf of our advertisers. These Cookies are used to determine whether you have seen certain content or advertising so that we may request your opinions. We may also use Cookies to authenticate respondents or to help you pick up where you left off in a survey. If you have Cookies disabled you may not be able to participate in some surveys.

_Remarketing on Third Party Web Sites_

The Reboot web site employs Google AdWords Remarketing ( _“Adwords”_ ) to advertise Reboot goods and services across the Internet. This is how it works: AdWords uses Cookies to track which parts of the Reboot web site you have viewed. Then, using the Non-Personal Information obtained through those Cookies, third party vendors (e.g., Google) display Reboot ads specifically tailored to you on third party web sites that you visit. This way, we are able to advertise Reboot goods and services in a way that best suits your specific needs.

If you do not wish to participate in AdWords, you can opt out by visiting Google’s Ads Preferences Manager. You can also opt out of any third-party vendor’s use of Cookies by visiting [www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices).

_Research and Measurement Activities_

Information that Reboot collects about you may be combined by Reboot with other information available to Reboot through third parties for research and measurement purposes, including measuring the effectiveness of content, advertising or programs. This information from other sources may include age, gender, demographic, location, personal interests, product purchase activity or other information. We may report aggregate information, which is not able to be identified back to an individual user of the Reboot web site, to our current or prospective advertisers and other business partners. We do not sell or share any Personal Information with any third parties, except contractors performing services on our behalf who agree not to use this information received from us for any purpose other than performing services on our behalf.

_Disclosures to Reboot Operations and Maintenance Contractor_

Reboot contractors sometimes have limited access to your Personal and Non-Personal Information in the course of providing products or services to Reboot. These contractors include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services, data analysis, research, advertising and marketing assistance and/or content for the operation and maintenance of the Reboot web site. We contractually require that our operations and maintenance contractors: (1) protect the privacy of your Personal and Non-Personal Information consistent with this Privacy Policy and (2) not use or disclose your Personal or Non-Personal Information for any purpose other than providing the limited service or function for Reboot.

_Disclosures to Third Party Web Sites_

Certain content, services and advertisements offered to you through the Reboot web site are served on, or contain links to, web sites hosted and operated by a company other than Reboot (“Third Party Web Sites”). Reboot does not disclose your Personal Information to these Third Party Web Sites without your consent, but you should be aware that any information you disclose to the other web sites once you access these other web sites is not subject to this Privacy Policy. Reboot does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third Party Web Sites.

In the event of such a change, your Personal Information will continue to be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy unless any changes to the Privacy Policy are made in accordance with the section below titled “Changes to This Privacy Policy.”



**How We Protect Your Information**

_Internal Safeguards_

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We use commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard Personal Information in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.

We will retain your Personal Information as long as your account is active or needed to provide you services. At any time you can remove your Personal Information or instruct us to remove it, but you should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to Reboot from our servers. Reboot tools that collect and store Personal Information allow you to correct, update or review information you have submitted by going back to the specific tool, logging-in and making the desired changes. We will also retain your Personal Information as necessary to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
