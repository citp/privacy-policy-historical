# Privacy Policy | Reboot Your Life

This Privacy Policy explains what Reboot Holdings Pty Ltd and its affiliated entities (collectively, “Reboot”, “we” or “us”) do with the personal information that is collected from the users of our website currently located at http://www.jointhereboot.com (our “Site”) and via the services we provide in connection with our Site. Reboot may change its policy from time to time, so it is suggested that you check the Site from time to time to ensure that you know about our current policy. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this policy, you should contact us via our Contact Page.

Our Site contains links to other sites. Once you enter another website (whether through an advertisement, service, or content link), be aware that Reboot is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites. We encourage you to look for and review the privacy statements of each and every website that you visit through a link or advertisement on our Site or through a service provided by Reboot.

#### CHILDREN

While our Site is intended for a general audience, our Site is not designed or intended to attract children under the age of 13. We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13.

#### INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Our Site collects information from users in a number of different ways. Any time you use our Site, some basic, general information is collected. This general information is used internally in connection with our business to improve our Site, including our marketing and advertising efforts.

When you set up an account on our Site, we collect additional personally identifiable information provided by you that may include your: (i) first and last name; (ii) address; (iii) email address; (iv) phone number; and (v) browsing and activity patterns. When you order a product directly from us, and not one of our partners (such as Amazon.com), we may also collect credit card and other billing information.

Additionally, when you register for a Reboot programme, we may also collect personally identifiable health information voluntarily provided by you. Please note that while we will work to maintain the privacy of any personally identifiable health information that you may provide us, Reboot is not subject to the privacy and security requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) or any other laws applicable to medical professionals and health care providers (or other “covered entities”).

#### HOW REBOOT USES AND SHARES YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

While we are committed to maintain the privacy of your billing information and personally identifiable health information, we may share or sell any of your other personal information for any legally permissible purpose at our discretion, including, but not limited to, those described in this Privacy Policy.

Reboot may specifically disclose the personal information that you provide us in the following circumstances:  
Reboot may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. They may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but will not be able to legally use it for other purposes.  
Reboot might change, sell, reorganize or liquidate via bankruptcy its business. If so, your information will of course be one of the transferred assets, although we may retain a copy of your information.  
We may release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Reboot, our users, or others. In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose your personally identifiable information to a third party, we will use reasonable attempts to notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court order.

#### SHARING OF GENERAL OR DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

Reboot will, from time to time, share aggregated, general or demographic information we collect about our users and their use of our Site with our partners and advertisers in a manner which does not identify any individual user. We may use an outside shipping company to ship orders placed on our Site and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services purchased on our Site. Such companies will not retain, share, store or use any of our user’s personal information for any secondary purposes. We may partner with other parties to provide specific services that are available on our Site. When a user signs up for these services, we will share the user’s name or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services to the user, but these parties will not be allowed to use such personal information except for the purpose of providing these services.

#### OUR COMMUNITY AREAS

Our Site features community areas and other public forums where users can share information and support one another, or where users can post questions for others, including Reboot and our team, to answer. Our communities and forums are open to the public and should not be considered private.

Any information shared in any on-line community area or other public forum is, by design, open to the public and is not private. Please think carefully before posting any personally identifiable information, especially health-related information, in any public forum. What you post may be seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we cannot control or predict. As with any public forum on any website, the information you post may also show up in third-party search engines like Google, Yahoo, MSN, Bing etc.

#### COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS

To enhance your on-line experience, we use “cookies” or similar technologies. Cookies are text files placed in your computer’s browser to store your preferences. Cookies do not contain personally identifiable information; however, once you choose to furnish a site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. We use cookies to understand site and Internet usage and to improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Site (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our Site. We also may use cookies to help us offer you products, programmes, or services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising.

We, our third party service providers, our advertisers or our partners may use cookies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through our Site and may also use “web beacons” or clear .gifs, or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a web page, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page.

You can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your web browser. You may set your web browser to accept all cookies, block certain cookies, require your consent before a cookie is placed in your web browser, or block all cookies. Blocking all cookies will affect your on-line experience and may prevent you from enjoying the full features offered at our Site.

#### LOG FILES

Like most websites, we use log files on our servers. These log files store information regarding IP (internet protocol) addresses, browser type, ISP (internet service provider), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. These log files are used to analyze trends, administer our Site, track user’s movements in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for our use.

#### CO-BRANDED WEBSITES

When accessing certain areas of our Site that are co-branded with a third-party’s trademarks, please be aware that even though the pages may have the same look and feel as that of our Site, you are actually entering your personal information on a co-branded partner website and should refer to the privacy policy applicable to that website.

#### SURVEYS AND CONTESTS

From time to time, our Site may request information from our users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you have the choice of whether or not to participate in such survey or content or provide us with such information. Information requested may include contact information, such as name and shipping address, and demographic information, such as post code and age. Contact information will generally be used to notify the winners of contests and award prizes. Survey information will generally be used to monitor or improve the use and efficiency of our Site. All such information shall be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.

#### COMMUNICATIONS WITH US

Reboot may send you occasional notices or newsletters about our services, unless you tell us not to. If you do not want to receive such offers and mailings, you can click the unsubscribe link, which you will find on our email messages, or send an email at any time via our Contact Page.
