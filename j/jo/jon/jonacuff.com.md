## Our Policy Behind Our Privacy Policy

We refuse to make you read through pages and pages of boring text about a policy that does nothing but trick you into _not_ reading it. Because we have every intention of protecting your privacy, we have made our privacy policy clear and concise enough that you will read it and feel comfortable using our site. We're here to help you, not put you to sleep!

Respecting the privacy and the security of your personal information is important to us. We realize that providing us with personal information is an act of trust. Therefore, we have created a Privacy Policy to show you the steps we have taken to secure that trust. Please take a few moments to read this policy carefully.

## Collected Information

In certain instances, you may be asked to provide personal information on our site. This information is for administrative or transaction use only. We use it to fulfill orders you have placed, better understand and serve your needs, and provide services tailored to you.

Non-personally identifiable information may be collected by our web-based tools for the purpose of online advertising and is completely anonymous.  This information may include such information as your IP address, date and time of visit, domain type, and their activity on our website. None of this information, individually or grouped together, can be traced back to you as an individual.   
In web language, a cookie is used to store data on a computer's hard drive. Almost all websites utilize cookies to one extent or another. Some of our web-based tools utilize cookies.  These cookies only collect and utilize non-personally identifiable information. 

We use the Google AdWords remarketing service to advertise on third-party websites (including Google) to previous visitors of our site. For example, we may advertise to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on our site (i.e., completing the checkout process). This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network.

Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s past visits to a website. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google’s privacy policy. You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ads Preferences page. If you wish, you can opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by adjusting your cookie settings or using a browser plugin.

## Use of Information

We do not use your information for any purpose without your consent. Your information will not be accessible to anyone other than our staff or business affiliates whose services you have requested. This information is specifically used by our affiliates to provide you with services you have requested and is not redistributed in any way. All that to say, we won’t sell your information to all the spammers that clutter your inbox!

We make every effort to keep you informed of our own special events, news and offers. Periodically, we send announcements via email or direct mail. If you do not wish to be contacted by our office, simply click on the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of the email newsletter.

_Note: We’ll have to hand over the information you provide if we’re ordered to do so by a court of law._

## Security

We are determined to keep your information private. We have even added measures to protect your personal information during transactions. For example, when you supply us with your debit card or checking account information to make a purchase, we encrypt your information to ensure a safe and secure transaction. Your payment information is temporarily stored on a secure server before processing.  
All of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. We use vendors that specialize in providing secure online payment solutions. None of your payment information can be accessed via the internet. Hey, we buy things online, too, so we understand how important this issue is to you!

## Contact

Please contact us if you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy. You are welcome to call our Customer Care Center at **888.22.PEACE** between 8:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. CST to speak with a customer service representative.
