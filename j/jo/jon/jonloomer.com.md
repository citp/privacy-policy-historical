Annual memberships to PHC are not eligible for any refunds due to the fact we provide such deep discounts on the annual pricing.

Cancellation requests for month to month PHC members must be made 10 days before your billing date. We cannot refund month to month fees unless we are notified within 24 hours of the charges to your account.
