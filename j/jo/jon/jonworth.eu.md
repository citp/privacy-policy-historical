_i) Cookies_

To make this site simpler, small data files – cookies – are placed on your computer.

They improve things by:

  * remembering settings, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you visit a new page
  * remembering information you’ve given so you don’t need to keep entering it
  * measuring how you use the website so features like “Popular” are filled with relevant content



Cookies here are not used to identify you personally. They are just here to make the site work better for you. Indeed, you can manage and/or delete these small files as you wish.

To learn more about cookies and how to manage them, visit [AboutCookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/ "Information about cookies").

_First Party Cookies  
_These are cookies that are set by this website directly.

I use Piwik to collect information about how people use this site. Piwik is installed on the same server as the blog itself – no data is passed to third parties. Piwik stores information about what pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here and what you click on. I do not collect or store your personal information (e.g. your name or address) so this information cannot be used to identify who you are.

There are also cookies that store basic data on your interactions with WordPress, the CMS running this website, whether you have logged into WordPress, and whether you have clicked “Accept” to remove the cookies message at the bottom of the screen.

_Third Party Cookies  
_These are cookies set on your machine by external websites whose services are used on this site. Cookies of this type are the sharing buttons across the site allow visitors to share content onto social networks. Cookies are currently set by LinkedIn, Twitter, Flattr and Facebook once a user clicks on the “Two Click Social Sharing” buttons. Additional third party cookies are set by Gravatar (the system that adds images when commenting) and also may be set for posts with embedded video. If you want to prevent sites setting third party cookies, instructions to do so are [here](http://www.aboutcookies.org/Default.aspx?page=1).

ii) Log files_

Log files allow me to record visitors’ use of the site. These logs are automatically generated from all our visitors, which I use to make improvements to the layout of the site and to the information in it, based on the way that visitors move around it. Log files do not contain any personal information about you.
