_i) Cookies_

To make this site simpler, small data files are placed on your computer. These are known as cookies. Most big websites do this too.

They improve things by:

  * remembering settings, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you visit a new page
  * remembering information you’ve given (eg your postcode) so you don’t need to keep entering it
  * measuring how you use the website so we can make sure it meets your needs



Our cookies aren’t used to identify you personally. They’re just here to make the site work better for you. Indeed, you can manage and/or delete these small files as you wish.

To learn more about cookies and how to manage them, visit [AboutCookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/ "Information about cookies").

_First Party Cookies  
_These are cookies that are set by this website directly.

__I use Google Analytics to collect information about how people use this site. We do this to make sure it’s meeting its users’ needs and to understand how we could do it better.  Google Analytics stores information about what pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here and what you click on. We do not collect or store your personal information (e.g. your name or address) so this information cannot be used to identify who you are.
