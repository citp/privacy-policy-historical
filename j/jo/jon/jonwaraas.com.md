# Privacy Policy - Jon Waraas

Thank you for visiting JonWaraas.Com, its affiliated websites and our mobile app (collectively, the “Site”)! JonWaraas.Com and our branded stores (“Jon Waraas”, “we”, “us” or “our”) know that you (“you”, “your”, “yourself”) care about how we collect, use, store and share your personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”). JonWaraas.Com respects your privacy and we want you to enjoy a comfortable and secure shopping experience with us. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use and (under limited circumstances) share your Personal Information (“Privacy Policy”).

If you visit our Site then you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

We are not responsible for the privacy of any information you reveal or post in any public forum (e.g., message board or chat room), or for the privacy practices of websites that are operated or owned by third parties.

 **I. Here’s What We Collect**

A. Information You Provide to Us.

We collect, store, and use the Personal Information you voluntarily provide to us. For example, if you place an order on the Site, you provide us your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, password, or credit card information. We use this information to confirm and process your order, update you on the status of your order, and respond to your questions, as well as for other purposes described in Section III of this Privacy Policy, below.

We may also collect and retain information when you create a gift registry or shopping list or other information you supply to us regarding your personal preferences, likes, and interests, whether it is provided by you directly or through third-party sites that you have authorized to supply such information to us. For example, if you access the Site through a social login functionality (e.g., logging into the Site with your Facebook credentials) or some other site to which you belong, you understand that some content and/or information in your third-party account (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us if you have authorized your third party account to make such transmissions. Third Party Account Information transmitted to us is covered by this Privacy Policy. We may also combine information you provide to us with information from public and other reputable sources, including, for example, updated contact information and demographic data.

Please note: You do not need to log in or provide Personal Information in order to visit our website. However, if you choose not to provide certain information, you may not be able to register with us or take advantage of some or all of our Site features and offerings. Providing us with Personal Information may allow you to receive, among other things, streamlined service, special discounts, faster checkout, order history information, and, if available, other products, information, and/or services you may request.

 **B. Information We Collect Automatically**

When you visit our Site, we automatically receive and store information about your visit on our servers. Our servers log your IP address, your page requests at our Site, and other information collected from “cookies”. A cookie is a small file that is sent to your computer’s browser or your mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies remain on your computer or device until they are deleted and tell us, for example, how you arrived at our Site (including search engines and search terms), how you navigate around our Site (including what products you search for and browse), and what products you purchase. We also use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and ordering history, and to serve direct personalized marketing from JonWaraas.Com (including on other web sites). To opt out of this marketing from JonWaraas.Com, click here In such ways, cookies allow us to provide you with a better and more personalized shopping experience and enable us to make you aware of our products and promotions that may be of interest to you. As explained in Section V of this Privacy Policy, most browsers allow you to block or reject cookies, although this may impact your ability to use features of our Site, including the shopping cart. JonWaraas.Com may combine information collected via cookies with Personal Information provided by you.

Along with cookies, we may deliver “web beacons” through our Site and/or e-mails to you which are associated with third-party advertising networks. Web beacons (also called “pixel tags”) are small graphic images that may not be visible to Site visitors that collect information about the usage of the Site on an anonymous basis. We may use web beacons in emails to determine device-type and learn if emails have been delivered and opened. JonWaraas.Com may also combine information from web beacons with Personal Information provided by you.

Web beacons also allow advertising networks to serve you JonWaraas.Com advertisements when you visit other websites. For example, a web beacon logs the products you view at our Site, and then shows you an ad for similar products from JonWaraas.Com when you browse to another website. Because your web browser receives advertising from the advertising network’s servers, these companies may set, view, or edit their own cookies or web beacons. Many advertising networks participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). The NAI is a cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards, and NAI member networks may allow you to opt-out of the cookies or web beacons they deliver. Please note that we do not control the policies of any third parties, including the privacy policies of advertising networks. Find out more about opting out of advertising network cookies and web beacons here.

If you download or use apps created by us or our partners onto your mobile device, we may also receive information about your location and your device, including the unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising and other personalized content. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services. We may also link mobile users’ unique IDs or their geographic data to existing customer profiles.

 **II. E-mails We Send**

If you place an order, create an account with us, or otherwise provide us your e-mail address, we may use that address to confirm your order, confirm the creation of an account, or to notify you of important information or changes to your account or our policies and practices.

In addition, we (or one of our affiliated stores/websites) may send you information about special offers, new products and services, system changes, and other information we think may be of interest to you. We own multiple brands/stores, and if you sign up with one brand/store, you are automatically subscribed to all the others and may receive emails from any of our brands. If you do not wish to receive these e-mails, you may “opt-out” or “unsubscribe” from these e-mails by following the instructions contained in the e-mail. You may also opt-out of receiving these e-mails during the ordering or registration process.

Our Site includes “e-mail to a friend” functionality that allows you to easily share product or other valuable information with your friends and family. Any e-mail addresses provided to us in the use of these features are used solely for the intended purpose of the e-mail communication you authorize. We do not retain these e-mail addresses in our database.

 **III. How We Use and Share your Personal Information**

We share some of your Personal Information with certain intermediaries in order to accept, process, and ship your order, but only the Personal Information needed for that intermediary to fulfill its obligation to you. For example, our freight carriers and shipping companies are provided with your name and shipping address in order to deliver your purchased products.

Other examples of when we may share Personal Information include:

• in order to provide services (e.g., gift registry) that you have requested;  
• at your direction or request (e.g., if you create a gift registry or shopping list and elect to make it available to the public, your information may be accessible on our website, and mobile or social applications);  
• when we believe in good faith that it is necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or to comply with law;  
• when we believe in good faith that it is necessary to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;  
• when we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law;  
• if JonWaraas.Com is acquired by or merged with another organization, Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party;  
• We may publicly disclose the name, city, and state of the contest and sweepstakes winners; and  
• with our affiliated brands and stores (unless you have opted out of our doing so).

We may also provide anonymized information to our partners, including, for example, our marketing, testing, personalization and analytics partners. Our partners help us better understand how often and in what ways people use our Site, so that we, and our partners, can provide you with the best experience. For example, we may place a cookie on your browser or mobile device that records the products you viewed at our Site, and then provide that information, in an anonymized form only, to a third-party partner, to allow such partner to show you ads for similar products that are available from us.

 **IV. Security of your Personal Information**

JonWaraas.Com is committed to online data security, and for that reason we take steps to make all information received from you online as secure as reasonably possible from unauthorized access and use. Our secure server software uses Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) encryption technology to secure your information during transmission. Your account is protected by a password. If you access your account via a social login, you may have additional or different sign-on protection through that third party (e.g., Facebook, Pinterest, etc.). You are responsible for preventing unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information through your computer or other devices. Do not share your password with anyone and do limit access to your computer or other devices by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

 **V. You’ve Got Choices**

While the Site does not respond to a web browser’s “Do Not Track” signal, JonWaraas.Com offers its customers choices with regard to its use and disclosure of Personal Information. These options include opting out of online behavioral advertising provided by JonWaraas.Com or from our third-party marketing partner(s), or choosing for us not to share Personal Information with third parties.

You may also delete cookies as soon as you leave our Site. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, by changing the add-on’s settings, or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer.

The inclusion of any link does not imply our endorsement of the external site company, its website or websites, or the products or services it promotes or sells.
