**Affiliate Links**

Jonnyelwyn.co.uk makes use of various affiliate programs which help to support the enormous amount of time needed to research, create and regularly update, the hundreds of posts on this site.

No editorial decisions are ever swayed by the use of affiliate links and it never adds to the cost of a product or service. In some circumstances the affiliate link [actually provides a discount](https://jonnyelwyn.co.uk/film-editing-freebies-promo-codes/).

If you have any questions, just drop them in the box above, I’d be happy to answer them as best I can. Otherwise, thank you for supporting the blog, I hope you’ve found it useful!

As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.

**Sponsored Content**

I get asked all the time to write about specific brands and products. Very occasionally, I agree to do so if I think the product would be of genuine interest to myself or my readers.

In these instances I ask the company to cover the cost of the time it takes to research, write and update the content. This is what a sponsored post means on my blog.

I retain complete editorial control, I write what I like and I say what I want. That’s the deal.

To provide some context, there are well over 700 posts on this site (and counting) and so far four of them have been sponsored.

If you have any questions, do drop me a note in the form above.

**Privacy Policy**

This is mostly cribbed from WordPress’ suggested privacy policy statement. Hopefully it will suffice!

_What personal data we collect and why we collect it_

If you make a comment or sign up to the weekly newsletter then you need to input your name and email address for those to function. I also run Google Analytics and Jetpack Stats to keep track of aggregate visitors, page views etc.

_Comments_

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymised string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it.

The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/

After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.
