FanGap is not responsible for the privacy statements on third party Web sites, which may differ from our policies and practices. Some of the advertisements that may appear on the Sites may also be delivered to you by third party advertising companies.

**Use of Cookies**

The Sites use "cookies" to help us recognize you and to personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize a page on one or more of our Sites, or register with FanGap, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as your name, billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same FanGap Site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Sites you visit.

**Security of your Personal Information**

FanGap employs administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Please be aware, however, that despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.

**Changes to this Statement**

FanGap may occasionally update this Privacy Statement to reflect company practices and customer feedback; each version will apply to information collected while it was in place. We will notify you of any material changes by posting a new Privacy Statement here and changing the effective date above. Therefore, we encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Statement to be informed of any changes.
