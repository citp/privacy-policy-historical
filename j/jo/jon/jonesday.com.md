**1\. WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE THAT INFORMATION**   
Jones Day does not collect any personally identifiable information from you ( _e.g_., name, address, telephone number, e-mail address) unless you voluntarily choose to submit or otherwise disclose such information to us, including information submitted or disclosed by mail, telephone, fax, or electronically. We will not sell, trade, or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties. Jones Day will only use your information to respond to your request for information or, if appropriate, to consider your request for consideration of employment with Jones Day.

Monitoring, Enforcement and Legal Requests: Jones Day has no obligation to monitor the Web site or the use of the Web site, or to retain the content of any user session. However, Jones Day reserves the right at all times to monitor, review, retain, and/or disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request or to cooperate with law enforcement and other authorities in investigating a claim of illegal activity. We may use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to protect our service, Web site, customers, or others.

Transmission Errors or Unauthorized Acts: Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Jones Day cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or any information provided online, and you do so at your own risk. Jones Day will not be liable for disclosures of your personal information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties. However, once we receive your transmission, we do our best to ensure its security on our systems by making reasonable efforts to protect the information.

Security: Any information provided to Jones Day is treated with care and discretion. Jones Day will take a proactive approach to ensure the information is kept private and not misused.
