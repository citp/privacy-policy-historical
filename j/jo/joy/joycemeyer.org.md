# Joyce Meyer Ministries — Privacy Policy

_Joyce Meyer Ministries, Inc_. ("JMM") is a Christian, nonprofit organization committed to excellence, integrity, and your privacy. Our mission is to earn and build your trust and confidence by promoting and upholding the highest standards concerning principles of disclosure and informed consent. This Privacy Policy is provided to inform you of the ways we gather and use information on www.joycemeyer.org ("Website"). This Privacy Policy does not apply to any website "linked" to this Website, and JMM is not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of such other websites.

 **Information Collection**

Please be aware that JMM is committed to upholding the highest level of confidentiality and security for those who choose to visit our Website. The types of information collected by JMM on this Website fall under one of two categories: Anonymous or Personal.

 _Anonymous Information_

Anonymous information cannot be traced back to a specific individual. Our web servers automatically record the IP address (the general location where the user is logged) of each visitor to this Website and tracks how many people visit our Website. We use this type of anonymous information to administer our Website more effectively, personalize this Website for you, and gain general information about the backgrounds and sources of visitors. 

_Personal Information_

Personal information identifies who you are. This is information that you personally and voluntarily provide as a result of a prompt on the Website. Such information includes, but is not limited to, your name, postal address, phone number, and email address. In the case of information provided to the America section of the Website (such as date of birth, marital status, gender, demographic, and other information), this data is handled by a third party. Credit card numbers may also be collected when online transactions occur through our Website. Following is a list of ways that JMM collects personal information from this Website:

_\- Online Requests for Information_

When you request information online from our Website, we ask for certain information in order to process your request. The information may include, but is not limited to, your name, postal address, phone number, email address, and other demographic information. In the case of information provided to the America section of the Website (such as date of birth, marital status, gender, demographic, and other information), this data is handled by a third party. Unless you "opt out," we may also use that information to send you additional literature about JMM and its conferences and resources.

 _\- Online Registration of Our Partners_

When an individual becomes a partner with JMM, certain information is collected to allow us to provide you with the highest degree of excellent service. The information collected in our online registration may include, but is not limited to, your name, postal address, phone number, email address, and other demographic information. In the case of information provided to the America section of the Website (such as date of birth, marital status, gender, demographic, and other information), this data is handled by a third party. Please be aware that we value your privacy, and your registration information is protected by password for your privacy and security. Unless you "opt out," we may use the information you voluntarily provide to send you additional literature about JMM and its conferences and resources.

 _\- Online Transactions_

When you desire to purchase resources from our Website or make a donation, certain information is necessary to allow us to ship your order to you as quickly and efficiently as possible or process your online donation. The information collected in an online transaction may include, but is not limited to, your name, credit card information, postal address, phone number, email address, and other demographic information. In the case of information provided to the America section of the Website (such as date of birth, marital status, gender, demographic, and other information), this data is handled by a third party. Because your privacy is of the utmost importance to us, we have taken steps to ensure that online transactions through our Website take place via encrypted secure servers. All the information you include and submit with your order or request for online donation is passed through our encrypted secure servers through the use of Verisign technology. With Verisign technology your card is charged electronically, and your actual account number is never presented to the merchant from whom you made your purchase.
