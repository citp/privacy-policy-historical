# Privacy Policy - JoyFoodSunshine

I have no formal culinary or nutritional training! I just enjoy cooking and healthy living! I learned from family members, other food bloggers, and lots of trial and error!

Each recipe and photograph shared on JoyFoodSunshine was created/captured by me unless otherwise noted. I work hard to create content for this site. Please do not republish any recipe content  without prior consent  and please do not redistribute my photography without giving proper credit and linking back to https://joyfoodsunshine.com.  _ _
