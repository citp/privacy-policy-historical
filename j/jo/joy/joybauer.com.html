Privacy Policy</strong></p><p>This policy covers how Healthy Code, Inc. treats personal information that Healthy Code, Inc. collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Healthy Code, Inc. products and services.

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Healthy Code, Inc. does not own or control, or to people that Healthy Code, Inc. does not employ or manage. In addition, certain Healthy Code, Inc. services may have their own associated privacy statements.</p><p>Healthy Code, Inc. operates this website (the "Site"), and other health, wellness, diet and fitness websites that are part of the Healthy Code, Inc. portfolio of websites (collectively, the "Sites") and the services related to or offered on the Sites (hereinafter, the "Services").

The Information We Gather</h3><p>We collect information about you in the following ways:</p><h4>A. Information you voluntarily provide us.</h4><p>We collect and maintain information that you voluntarily submit to us during your use of the Sites and Services.

For more information, please see the How We Use Your Information section below.</p><h4>B. Information we collect through your use of the Site.</h4><p>As you use the Site and Services, certain information may also be passively collected. Through cookies, pixels, beacons, log files and other technologies, we may collect information about how you use the Site and the Services. For example we may determine through an IP address that a particular computer or device is located in San Francisco and we may use this information to deliver advertisements promoting San Francisco-based businesses. This information allows us to deliver more helpful information, programs, tools and advertisements. Please see the Cookies and Targeted Advertising sections below for more information.</p><h4>C. Information we receive from third parties.</h4><p>We may also combine online and/or offline information received from third parties with the information we have already collected from you via our Sites and Services. The third party information is used for a variety of purposes including to verify other information about you (e.g., verify your mailing address to send you requested products or services) and to enhance the content and advertising we provide to you.</p><h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3><p>We will use your Personal Information in the ways described below or described at the time that the information is collected.</p><h4>A. Advertising.</h4><p>We believe that advertising is more interesting to you when it is relevant. Accordingly, we customize the advertisements that you see based upon: (i) the information that you provide us (e.g., age, gender, stated health interests and other information in your profile); (ii) geographic location information, which we may determine through your IP address, from your mobile device, or other ways; (iii) data we receive from third parties or; (iv) your visits on the Sites or use of Services (commonly referred to as "Behavioral Advertising"). Please see the Cookies and Targeted Advertising section below for more information on the use of cookies and the information collected for Behavioral Advertising.</p><h4>B. To Provide the Sites and Services.</h4><p>In general, we use your Personal Information as necessary or appropriate for purposes including to:</p><ul><li>administer your account;</li><li>register you and provide you access to the Site or Services;</li><li>respond to inquiries or requests that you direct to us;</li><li>fulfill your requests for products or services;</li><li>send communications and administrative emails about the Sites or Services;</li><li>personalize and better tailor the features, performance and support of the Sites and Services for your use;</li><li>send you promotional/marketing information, newsletters, offers or other information regarding opportunities and functionality that we think would be of particular interest to you;</li><li>improve the quality of the Site and the Services, and</li><li>analyze, benchmark and conduct research on user data and user interactions with the Site and Services.</li></ul><h3>3. Cookies and Targeted Advertising</h3><h4>A. Cookies, Web Beacons and IP Address Information.</h4><p>"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website places on your browser when you visit that website. We may use cookies to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with the Sites and Services. For example, we may use cookies to control what advertisements you see, the sequence of advertisements and to make sure you don't see the same advertisement too many times. For contests or sweepstakes, we may also use cookies in order to track your progress and the number of entries in some promotions. For polls, we may use cookies to help ensure that an individual can't vote more than once on a particular question or issue. We do not store Personal Information in any cookies on your computer.</p><p>Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser's directions within the help tab. In order to use certain Services offered through the Sites, your web browser must accept cookies. If you choose to disable cookies, some aspects of the Sites may not work properly, and you may not be able to access our Services.</p><p>We may also use cookies, pixels, web beacons (which are usually small, transparent graphic images), operating system and device information and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit, the features and information for which you searched and viewed, the email you opened, or on which advertisements you clicked. This type of information is collected to make the Sites and Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.</p><p>An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We, or our service providers, may use your IP Address when you access the Sites or Services or use other means to assist with delivering geographically targeted advertisements.</p><h4>B. Targeted Advertising.</h4><p>Companies Healthy Code, Inc. works with may use cookies for purposes including understanding Web usage patterns of users who see advertisements on the Sites, controlling the sequence of advertisements you see, making sure you don't see the same advertisement too many times, determining your interests and tailoring advertisements and promotions based on those interests. For example, if you read an article about a particular health condition on the Sites, we may use cookies from a vendor to later serve you an advertisement for a product related to the viewed article. These third party vendors may connect information about pages you visit on our Sites with information about pages you visit on other websites and show you advertising based on this combined information. The advertisement may appear when you are visiting a different section of this Site, another Site or any other website on the Internet if the website also has a relationship with our vendor.</p><h4>C. Information Collected by Third Party Advertisers</h4><p>Advertisers or other third parties on the Sites may also engage in Behavioral Advertising and use cookies and web beacons in the manner described above. We do not control these advertisers or other parties' use of cookies or web beacons or what they do with the information they collect. Many third party vendors that engage in Behavioral Advertising participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and abide by NAI and/or DAA principles. If you wish to opt out of participating in advertising programs conducted by NAI and DAA members or learn more about the NAI and DAA, please go to the NAI Opt-Out website and DAA Choice Page and follow the instructions. After you opt-out, you will still see advertisements, but the advertising may not be as relevant to your interests. If you change your computer, change your browser or delete your cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out.</p><h3>4.

We also use secure server software (SSL) to process all financial transactions that occur on the Site. SSL technology can encrypt Personal Information transmitted over the Internet.
