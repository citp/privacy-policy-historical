In some cases, in order to personalize the process of connecting, we may receive a limited amount of information even before you authorize the application or website.</p>

<p>Some applications may be co-branded and offered together with or via a partner company. If you register for or use such applications, you consent to both Jolicloud and the partner company’s use of personal data collected in connection with the co-branded product.</p>

<h2>What we use your information for</h2>

<p>The reason we collect information is to provide you with a reliable, safe, efficient and personalized experience. Jolicloud collects and uses, or has third party service providers acting on Jolicloud’s behalf collecting and using, personal data relating to you, as permitted or necessary to (i) deliver services for you (as described when we collect the information), (ii) provide you with help &amp; support, (iii) let you know about service status, updates and faults, (iv) compare information for accuracy, (v) get your feedback on our services and on how we are doing, (vi) resolve disputes, (vii) verify your identity, (viii) evolve, enhance and measure the Jolicloud distribution &amp; related services and websites; and (ix) set up and undertake Jolicloud's marketing or promotional activities and events.</p>

<p><u>We do not sell your personal data.</u></p>

<p>We do not disclose your private information except in the limited following situations : (i) when we have your consent to do so, such as when you use a third party service to connect to your Jolicloud account, (ii) when we work with trusted third parties partners who carry out specific functions and services for us, we may share your personal information with them. However this is only done to the extent necessary for them to perform the functions and services we require of them, and only pursuant to obligations mirroring the protections of this privacy policy and (iii) when required to do so by a law regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to tackle fraud, security or technical issues; or to perserve Jolicloud's rights or property.</p>

<h2>Information security</h2>

<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.</p>

<h2>Transfer of your Information outside the EEA</h2>

<p>Your Information may be collected, stored, accessed and further processed (by us or data processors acting on our behalf) in the United States and other territories both inside and outside the EEA. If we process your Information on servers or using service providers based in such territories, we will ensure that your Information is afforded the same level of protection as in the EEA.</p>

<h2>Enforcement (right of access and modification)</h2>

<p>According to the French data protection law dated 6th January 1978, you have a right to access and modify your personal data stored by Jolicloud. Accordingly, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. To access and modify your personal data, please send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@jolicloud.com">privacy@jolicloud.com</a> and follow these instructions. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.</p>

<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
