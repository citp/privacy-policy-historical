This Privacy & Cookies Policy (this “ **Policy** ”) explains how your Information (as defined below) is collected, used and disclosed by us and how we collect Information through the use of cookies and related technologies.

This policy is intended to inform you about how we collect and use your Information. Although we encourage you to read the entire Policy, the following provides a summary of some of the important aspects of our privacy practices: 

  * We use your Information primarily to provide you with access to our Platforms and other products, services, and information we offer.

**Information Received, Collected, and Obtained by JDA.   **The information we receive, collect, and obtain includes information that is both Personal and Non-Personal.  “ **Personal** ” information is a broad concept and refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable living individual. This includes references to obvious identifiers such as name but also non- obvious identifiers such as an identification number or an online identifier such as an IP address or cookie identifier. “ **Non-Personal** ” information refers to information that is anonymous whereby you are not or no longer identifiable from that information. 

We receive, collect, and obtain the following general types of Personal and Non-Personal information (together, “ **Information** ”): 

**Information Obtained Directly from You.   **We collect Information about you directly when you voluntarily provide it to us through the Platforms or other interactions with us such as your name, contact information, gender, preferred language, job title and function, user name and password, billing information and information about your access to and use of the Platforms and your contacts with other users through the Platforms, as well as other Information you may volunteer to us (e.g. event feedback, profile photo, business card).

We also receive Information you provide to our authorized Resellers and Alliance Partners of our products and services which will be used for the purposes outlined in this Policy.

**Sensitive Information.   **

You are not required to provide JDA with any Information regarding your medical or health condition, race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or other categories of Information defined as sensitive or special categories of data under applicable data protection laws ("Sensitive Information") in order to use our Platforms and Services.  JDA does not knowingly solicit or collect, and you should not provide to JDA, any such Sensitive Information, whether through the Platforms or through any other means.

Our Platforms are intended for a general audience and are not directed to children under 13 years of age.  JDA does not knowingly receive, collect, or obtain Personal Information from children under 13 years of age. 

**Your California Privacy Rights.   **

California law provides that California residents have a right to request that businesses tell them how their Personal Information has been shared with third parties for use in direct marketing purposes.  However, there is an exception to this requirement for businesses that have adopted and disclosed, in their privacy policy, a policy of not disclosing a person’s Personal Information to third parties for use in direct marketing purposes if that person has exercised an option to opt-out of the disclosure of their Personal Information to third parties for such purposes. 

JDA has adopted a policy of allowing you to opt-out of the disclosure of your Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes and thus falls within this exception.  Instructions for opting out can be found in the section below entitled Your Rights and Choices below.

Certain web browsers and other devices you may use to access the Platforms may permit you to indicate your preference that you do not wish to be “tracked” online.  At this time we do not modify your experience on the Platforms or the Information we collect from you through the Platform based on whether such a preference is indicated.

**Cookies and Related Technologies.   **

We and our third party service providers use “cookies,” “web beacons,” and other automated tracking technology to monitor and collect Information regarding your interaction with the Platforms.  “Cookies” include commonly used pieces of information in the form of small files that are placed on an individual's computer or mobile device to allow us to recognize your computer or mobile device.  “Web beacons” (also known as “single–pixel” or “clear” GIFs) include electronic images imbedded in a Site, Application or email used to pass information from your computer to us. 

We may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies that expire once you close your web browser or that persist and stay on your computer until you delete them.

Most browsers will allow you to erase some or all of the cookies from your computer or mobile device, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.  You may also be able to refuse certain web beacons by adjusting the settings on your browser or email software.  Please refer to your browser or email software instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.  To find out more about these technologies, visit: [www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/).

They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaigns. They allow us to understand and evaluate clicks on our adverts so that we can improve the service you receive. They are usually placed by advertising networks with our permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. Advertisers and other third parties (including the ad networks, ad-serving companies, and other service providers they may use) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalized ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards.

Please note that there are many more networks listed on this site than we use our Platforms. 

**Your Rights and Choices**

Whenever we rely on your consent, you will always be able to withdraw that consent, unless we have another legal ground for processing your Personal Information.
