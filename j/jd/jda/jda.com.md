For instructions on how to “opt-out” of disclosure of your Personal Information to these third parties, including how to opt-out of the disclosure of your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, please see the Choice and Opt-out section below. 

**Collection, Use, and Sharing of** **Non-Personally Identifiable Information by JDA.   **

Our Platform may also automatically collect certain Non-Personal Information when you use or interact with the Platform.  We also receive and obtain Non-Personal Information from third parties.  This Non-Personal Information will include, by way of example, performance information and other metrics regarding your use of and access to the Platform or demographic information from the geographic region associated with your IP address. 

**Sensitive Information.   **

You are not required to provide JDA with any Information regarding your medical or health condition, race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or other sensitive Information in order to use our Platform.  The Platform may, however, collect precise geolocation information from you.  JDA does not knowingly solicit or collect, and you should not provide to JDA, any such sensitive Information, whether through the Platform or through any other means. 

**Children.   **

**Disclosure of Information as Required by Law.**  

Though we make reasonable and appropriate efforts to preserve User privacy as stated in this Policy, we may need to disclose Personal Information of certain Users when we have a reasonable and good-faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to enforce the terms of use for a Site or Application, to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or other legal process, to avoid injury to a third party, or to otherwise enforce or protect JDA's rights under applicable law, including, without limitation, JDA's intellectual property rights.  In these situations we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of our disclosure to all affected Users, to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances. 

**Your California Privacy Rights.   **

California law provides that California residents have a right to request that businesses tell them how their Personal Information has been shared with third parties for use in direct marketing purposes.  However, there is an exception to this requirement for businesses that have adopted and disclosed, in their privacy policy, a policy of not disclosing a person’s Personal Information to third parties for use in direct marketing purposes if that person has exercised an option to opt-out of the disclosure of their Personal Information to third parties for such purposes. 

JDA has adopted a policy of allowing you to opt-out of the disclosure of your Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes and thus falls within this exception.  Instructions for opting out can be found in the section below entitled “Choice and Opt-Out.” 

**Do Not Track.   **

Certain web browsers and other devices you may use to access the Platform may permit you to indicate your preference that you do not wish to be “tracked” online.  At this time we do not modify your experience on the Platform or the Information we collect from you through the Platform based on whether such a preference is indicated.  ****

**Choice and Opt-out.**  

We provide you with a choice whether to receive certain emails, surveys or other messages through the Platform and the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your Personal Information shared with third parties or used for certain purposes.  If you no longer wish to receive messages from JDA through the Platform, or to have your Personal Information shared with third parties as permitted by this Policy, you may opt-out of receiving those messages from us or having your Personal Information shared with third parties. 

In many cases, opting out of receiving messages or having your Personal Information shared with a third party will not affect your ability to use or access the Platform.  However, some messages (e.g. account notifications and service announcements) are considered necessary to our operation of the Platform.  Likewise, some of the third parties with which we share your Personal Information are used by us to provide necessary functionality for the Platform.  If you wish to opt-out of receiving these messages or of sharing your Personal Information with those third parties, we may be required to limit or cancel your access to and use of some or all of our Platform.  Note also that while you may opt-out of receiving messages from JDA, you may be required to contact or third parties directly to also opt-out of receiving emails or other messages from those third parties. 

All opt-out requests can be made through the Platform or by contacting us as described above.  Note that it may take up to 10 business days to remove your contact information from our lists, so you may receive messages from us for a time after your request.

**Automated Tracking (Cookies and Web Beacons).   **

We and our third party service providers use “cookies,” “web beacons,” and other automated tracking technology to monitor and collect Information regarding your interaction with the Platform.  “Cookies” include commonly used pieces of information in the form of small files that are placed on an individual's computer or mobile device to allow us to recognize your computer or mobile device.  “Web beacons” (also known as “single–pixel” or “clear” GIFs) include electronic images imbedded in a Site, Application or email used to pass information from your computer to us.

**Notification of Changes.   **

We will notify Users of any changes to this Policy.  Notification will be made by way of an email to Users or by posting of the changes on the Sites or through the Applications.  Changes to this Policy will be effective 15 calendar days following notice to any existing Users and immediately for any new Users.  Your continued use of the Platform after any change has become effective will constitute your acceptance of that change. 

Unless we seek and receive consent from a User, we will use the Personal Information we collect from each User in accordance with the version of this Policy effective when the Information was last collected.  Users may contact us as described above regarding any change to this Policy, including to prevent their Personal Information from being used pursuant to any change to this Policy.

JDA is committed to protect and secure your Personal Information.  Despite our commitment, no security system can be 100% effective and we cannot guarantee that your Information will be secure in all situations.  We will nonetheless take all reasonable and appropriate steps to insure the safety and security of your Personal Information.  This includes using at least industry standard security measures to protect the loss, misuse, and unintended alteration of the Personal Information under our control.  For example, our policy is that only those individuals who need your Personal Information to perform a specific job for us are granted access to that Personal Information.  Likewise, all employees and contractors are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. 

**Transfer of Information.   **

If JDA elects, in its reasonable discretion, to transfer ownership or control of a Site or Application to a third party, whether or not in the context of an acquisition, merger, or reorganization, you consent to the transfer of your Information (both Personal and Non-Personal) by JDA to that third party, provided that all use and sharing of your Information by that third party remains subject to the terms of this Policy and any applicable changes.
