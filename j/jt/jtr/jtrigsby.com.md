# Privacy at jtrigsby.com | jtrigsby.com

Ethel Guarding the Safe, Thanks Grandma!

Here at jtrigsby.com, I respect your privacy (unlike my other sites?) and I am committed to safeguarding your privacy while online at jtrigsby.com. The following page discloses how I gather, use, fold, spindle, mutilate and otherwise disseminate information for this Blog.

**RSS Feeds and Email Updates**

If a user wishes to subscribe to my RSS Feeds or Email Updates (powered by Feedburner), I ask for contact information such as name and email address. Users may opt-out of these communications at any time. Your personal information will never be sold or given to a third party. (You will never be spammed by me - ever)

**Log Files and Stats**

Like most blogging platforms I use log files, in this case Google Analytics. This stores information such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring, exit and visited pages, platform used, date/time stamp, track user’s movement in the whole, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses etc are not linked to personally identifiable information. While aggregate and summary data may be provided to advertisers and potential advertisers, they won’t know any more about you than I do!

**Cookies**

(Uh, no, not the kind you eat with milk!) A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. This blog doesn’t use cookies. However, some of my business partners (advertisers) use cookies on this site. I can’t access or control these cookies once the advertisers have set them.

**Links**

This Blog contains links to other sites. Please be aware that I am not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites. I suggest my users to be aware of this when they leave this blog and to read the privacy statements of each and every site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Blog.

**Advertisers**

I use outside ad companies to display ads on this blog. These ads may contain cookies and are collected by the advertising companies and I do not have access to this information. I work with the following advertising companies: Google Adsense, ROI Rocket, Project Payday & Entrecard. Please check the advertisers websites for respective privacy policies.

**Contact Information**

If you have any questions or concerns please contact Thom Rigsby at jtrigsby at jtrigsby dot com. This privacy policy updated February 2009. Thank you, and good night!
