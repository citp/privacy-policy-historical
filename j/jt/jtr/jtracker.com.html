<p>Effective Date:  June 29, 2006</p><p>
</p><p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING.
THE FOLLOWING POLICIES CONCERN YOUR PRIVACY WHEN YOU ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE
THIS WEB SITE AND ITS SERVICES.</p>



<p>This Web site is owned and
operated by 1st Auto Transport Directory, Inc. ("1st Auto", "we", "us").  <span class="blktxt">Your privacy is important to 1st Auto.  This Privacy Policy
outlines the types of personally identifiable information (such as email
address, home or business addresses, or telephone number) and other information
(such as cookies and log files that, when linked to your name or contact
information, allows us to personalize your visit) that we gather<span class="blktxt"> while you are visiting the JTracker.com site (the "Site"), as
well as ways in which we process and disseminate such information.  This
privacy statement does not pertain to information collected on any other site
owned by 1st Auto, its subsidiaries or other businesses.</span></span></p>



<p>1st Auto reserves the right
to change, modify, add, or remove provisions of this Privacy Policy.  Any
changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted here, and we encourage you to
check back from time to time to ensure continuing familiarity with the most
current version of our Privacy Policy.  <span class="blktxt">At the top of this
page, we will indicate the "Effective Date" of the most recent version of the Privacy
Policy; this will allow you to determine whether the Privacy Policy has been
revised since your previous visit to the Site.</span></p>



<p>Please read this Privacy
Policy as well as this Site's Terms of Service carefully.  Your use of this Site
constitutes your acceptance to be bound by this statement and the Site's Terms
of Service without limitation, qualification or change.  If at any time you do
not accept all the terms and conditions contained herein and in the Terms of Service,
you must immediately discontinue use of this Site.</p>



<p><b>What Information We
Collect.</b></p>



<p><b>Non-Personally
Identifiable Information.</b></p>

<p>When you enter this Site,
information is gathered from your Internet browser.  This information may
include your IP address and log files (which allows us to determine the
identity of your Internet Service Provider), your operating system and the type
of browser software that you are using to access this Site.  All information
obtained from your browser is anonymous, and no personal information is ever
transmitted to us in this manner.</p>



<p>While we do not at this time
use cookies, web beacons or similar technology to collect information about how
you use this Site, we may do so in the future.  A "cookie" is a small text file
that a Web site can place on your computer's hard drive in order, for example,
to retain your preferences and/or registration information for your next visit
to that Web site.  The cookie transmits this information back to that Web site's
operator.  You can choose not to receive a cookie file by enabling your Web
browser to refuse cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie.  Note that
refusing to accept cookies may impact the performance of a Web site. </p>



<p><b>Personally Identifiable Information.</b></p>

<p>Most portions of this Site
are "registration-required" pages that require you to submit personal
information before we grant you access.  Such information includes your name,
company name, address, e-mail address, phone numbers and other identifying
information about you and your company, including, but not limited to, Employer
Identification Number (EIN), Motor Carrier number, insurance and license information
and business references.</p>



<p><b>How We Use Information We
Collect.</b></p>



<p><b>Non-Personally
Identifiable Information.</b></p>



<p>We may use non-personally identifiable
information to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the Site and
pages viewed as well as to diagnose problems with our servers and to administer
the Site. We may then use this information to analyze and improve the features
and functionality of this Site.  Please note that we also may match
non-personally identifiable information, such as your IP address, to your
personally identifiable information in order to augment our ability to
administer, and to optimize, the Site for you.</p>



<p>We may in the future use
cookies to allow us to customize delivery of information on and through the
Site.  For example, this Site may use cookies to save and remember registration
information or preferences that you may have set while browsing the Site and to
save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our
Site.</p>



<p><b>Personally Identifiable
Information.</b></p>



<p>We may share the personally
identifiable information you disclose to us on this Site for any reason and to
any person or entity, including, but not limited to, within our company, with
third parties who subscribe to this Site, with third parties who work with us
on marketing, product development, service enhancement and other similar
matters, with third parties in connection with a sale of our company or with
third parties in response to legal requests or requirements.  Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, we may use personally identifiable information
you give us as follows:</p>



<p>a.         Site:  We may use
personally identifiable information you give us to better tailor your Web site
experience to your interests, and to send you information about 1st Auto and
its services as well as promotional material on behalf of some of our partners.
 We use other personally identifiable information that you provide to us to
show you content in which you may be interested and to display the content
according to your preferences.  We will also share this information within the
1st Auto business family in order to enhance your experience on this and other
1st Auto Web sites.</p>



<p>b.         Administrative
Matters:  1st Auto reserves the right to contact you in the event of a change
in the Site's Terms of Service and/or this Privacy Policy, or to notify you of
other administrative matters in connection with the Site (e.g., contacting you
to facilitate, complete or confirm a transaction).</p>



<p>c.         Transactions With
E-Commerce Partners, Vendors and Advertisers:  When you provide personally
identifiable financial information and other personally identifiable
information to one of our Site's e-commerce partners, vendors or advertisers,
this transaction will occur in connection with the site of the e-commerce
partner, vendor or advertiser, not on the Site, and, as such, the financial and
other personally identifiable information you provide is collected pursuant to
and controlled by the privacy policy of such e-commerce partner, vendor or
advertiser.  1st Auto is not responsible for such parties' privacy policies and
we encourage you to familiarize yourself with the applicable privacy policy of
the e-commerce site with which you transact business or to contact the operator
of such site for more information. </p>



<p>Please be aware that at
times, at the request of or on behalf of our e-commerce partners, vendors or
advertisers, 1st Auto may "pre-populate" forms with your personally
identifiable data for your review, and, if you so choose, for submission to
such e-commerce partners, vendors or advertisers; at other times, forms are
pre-populated with your personally identifiable information in order to
facilitate a transaction between you and 1st Auto with no such personally
identifiable information being transmitted to 1st Auto partners, vendors or
advertisers upon submission of such form.  Accordingly, we encourage you to
review each pre-populated form carefully before agreeing to submit your
information to determine who is seeking to collect your information, and to
familiarize yourself with the applicable privacy policy governing use of any
personally identifiable information collected about you. </p>



<p>d.         1st Auto
Employees, Contractors and Agents:  1st Auto may employ other companies and
individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as processing of payments,
operating features of the Site, or hosting or maintaining our servers.  These
other companies may have access to your personal information as necessary to
carry out their functions, but, absent your consent, they are not permitted to
share that information with any third party (other than as necessary to perform
their duties).</p>



<p>e.         Compliance With
Applicable Law:  1st Auto may also access and disclose personally identifiable
information in the event that we believe, in 1st Auto's discretion, that such
action is reasonably necessary to comply with government requests; to enforce
the Terms of Service or other published guidelines; to protect 1st Auto, its
users or others; to respond to circumstances that we feel constitute an
emergency; or as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law.  Please be
aware that, in connection with the foregoing, 1st Auto may provide information
about you gathered through other sites controlled, owned or operated by 1st
Auto or 1st Auto affiliates to the extent permitted under the applicable
privacy policy governing collection and use of such information. </p>



<p>f.          Banner Ads.  1st
Auto sometimes uses individual data collected via the Site to "target"
advertising - to decide which advertisements and sponsor messages to show to
which members.</p>



<p>g.         Opt-In/Opt-Out
Policy: When you become a Site member or otherwise supply 1st Auto with
personally identifiable information in connection with the Site, or from
time-to-time in 1st Auto's discretion, you may be asked to indicate whether you
are interested in receiving information from us about special offers in connection
with the Site, 1st Auto and/or our advertisers and partners.  You will also be
provided with the opportunity to opt-in to receiving offers directly from our
third-party advertisers or partners.  If you do choose to opt-in, you will
receive such communications in accordance with your "opt-in" consent. You may,
of course, choose not to receive offers or other marketing communications from
us or our third-party advertisers or partners as follows: </p>
<ul>

<li>      Upon
becoming a Site member, you can choose to receive no marketing communications
from us. Please be aware, however, that, even under this option, you may still
receive an initial member welcome message, as well as communications as
appropriate to inform you of changes to the Site, this Privacy Policy or other
administrative matters.<p></p>

</li><li>            At
any time, you can follow a link provided in our newsletters or commercial email
messages (but excluding e-commerce confirmations and other administrative
emails) to unsubscribe from that particular mailing list or email service. <p></p>

</li><li>            At
any time, you can contact us through info@centraldispatch.com to have your
contact preference changed to "Do Not Contact Me". <p></p>

</li><li>             At
any time, you can contact us through info@centraldispatch.com to opt out of
having your personally identifiable information shared with our affiliates for
their direct marketing purposes.<p></p>

</li></ul>

<p>If you decide to contact us
to change your contact preference to "Do Not Contact Me", 1st Auto will
implement this change to your Site profile within ten (10) business days of your
request. Please be aware that your requested change will not be effective until
1st Auto implements such change and that such requests will be implemented only
in connection with your Site profile, and will not impact any preferences you
may have made to any other site controlled, owned or operated by 1st Auto or
its affiliates. In addition, please keep in mind that even if you opt-out from
receiving communications from the Site, residual information about you will
remain within 1st Auto databases, access logs and other records, which may or
may not contain such personally identifiable information. The residual
information will not be used for commercial purposes; however, 1st Auto
reserves the right, from time to time, to recontact former customers or users
of the Site for administrative purposes or in order to comply with applicable
law.</p>



<p>If you opt-in to the
disclosure of your personally identifiable information to third parties, and
you subsequently decide that you would like to discontinue receiving offers and
other promotional materials from such third parties, you may need to contact
those third parties directly in order to opt-out of further communications. </p>



<p>Please note that 1st Auto
reserves the right to change its opt-in/opt-out practices by modifying or
updating this Privacy Policy as set forth above.</p>



<p><b>Accessing, Updating or
Deleting Information Collected About You.</b></p>

<p>This Site also gives you the
opportunity to modify or remove personally identifiable information that you
have provided to us by way of this Site.  You may do so by modifying your
password-protected registered user information on the site.  To the extent that
such information is stored in our databases, we will respond to your changes
immediately, although please understand that although this information, once
deleted, is not available on the Site, that information may remain stored
indefinitely in our backup and archival records.  However, to the extent that
such information is not stored in our databases, we cannot always ensure that
these corrections or deletions will immediately reach such other databases.</p>



<p>Modify your registered user
information on our Site; or send an email to info@centraldispatch.com.</p>



<p><b>Security Precautions.</b></p>

<p>1st Auto employs reasonable
security measures consistent with standard industry practice, for information
collected through this Site.  However, you should exercise discretion with
respect to the submission of any personal or financial information to this Site.
 Transmitting information via the Internet is never completely secure and,
therefore, any information submitted may be intercepted, collected, used or
disclosed by others.  We cannot, and do not, guarantee that information
supplied by users will not be accessed on our servers, or intercepted,
collected, used or disclosed by others while being transmitted to or from the
Site over the Internet.</p>



<p>Please remember that security
of the username and password you create when you register with the Site, is
your responsibility; we recommend that you do not share them with anyone.  If
you share your username and password, you are providing access to your personal
information.  You will be responsible for all uses of your registration,
whether or not authorized by you.  You agree to immediately notify 1st Auto of
any unauthorized use of your username or password.</p>



<p><b>Links to Other Web Sites.</b></p>

<p>The Site may contain links to
other Web sites, which may or may not be owned or operated by 1st Auto.  All
links to Web sites not part of our company are made without any representations
or warranties relating to the integrity, security or legitimacy of such Web
sites.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of Web
sites that are not owned and operated by 1st Auto, including such sites' use of
any information (such as IP number, browser type or operating system) collected
when visitors to the Site click through links to those sites.  This Privacy
Policy cannot and does not apply to external Web sites and, once you leave this
Site, you are subject to that Web site's privacy policies and procedures.  We
strongly encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices and privacy
policies of external Web sites before providing personally identifiable
information.  If you have concerns about any linked Web site, we invite you to
contact us.</p>



<p><b>Intended for Adults Only.</b></p>

<p>This Site is for use by
adults only.  We will not solicit, collect or maintain personal information
from children under the age of 18.  In the event that a child under the age of
18 attempts to register as a member of our Site, we will NOT accept the
registration and will delete information received from the child.  In the event
that a child posts personal information to the Site, we will attempt to delete
that information once we become aware of it.</p>



<p><b>Content.</b></p>

<p>Neither 1st Auto nor any
third-party licensor shall have any liability for the accuracy or completeness
of this service, any information contained therein, or any component thereof or
for delays, inauthenticity, omissions, or other defects therein nor for any
claims or losses arising therefrom or occasioned thereby, including, without
limitation, any lost profits, indirect, special, or consequential damages.  You
agree not to use or permit anyone to use the information provided through the
service for any unlawful or unauthorized purpose.</p>



<p><b>Legal Construction of this
Privacy Policy.</b></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy and the
Terms of Service provided on this Site shall be governed by, construed and
enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California, as it is
applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within such
state, without regard to conflict of law principles. You agree that any cause
of action you or 1st Auto brings to enforce this Privacy Policy or the Terms of
Service, or in connection with any matters related to this Site and/or the Privacy
Policy, shall be brought only in either the state or Federal courts located in San
Diego County in the State of California.  You agree to submit to the personal
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of California for any cause of action
arising out of this Privacy Policy.  You agree to file any cause of action with
respect to this Privacy Policy within one year after the cause of action
arises.  You agree that a cause of action filed after this date is barred.</p>



<p>If any provision of this Privacy
Policy, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances, is held
invalid or for any reason, unenforceable including, but not limited to, the
warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, then such provision shall be
deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that matches, as closely as
possible, the original provision, and the other provisions of this privacy
statement shall remain in full force and effect. The failure of either party to
insist upon strict performance of any provision of this privacy statement shall
not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Unless expressly
provided otherwise, this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service presented on
this Site comprise the entire agreement between you and 1st Auto with respect
to the use of this Site and shall not be modified except in writing, signed by
an authorized representative of 1st Auto.</p>
