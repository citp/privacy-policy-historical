<p>Why A Privacy Statement?</p>
     
     <p>We respect your individual privacy. That is why we have adopted
     this Privacy Statement, which embodies our commitment to the
     protection of your privacy through adherence to fair electronic
     information practices. This Privacy Statement puts you, the
     individual, in control of how your personal information is
     processed, and you have our promise that we will not electronically
     process your personal information in any way that is incompatible
     with this Privacy Statement. This Privacy Statement protects your
     privacy by:</p>
     
    <p>informing you about-</p>
     
<p>  </p><ul><li>   the types of personal information JT.ORG collects about
       you through its Web sites;</li>
    <li>  how it collects that information;</li>
    <li>  the general purposes for which it collects such information;</li>
   <li>   the types of organizations to which it discloses the information;</li>
    <li>  the choices and means by which individuals may limit its use and
       disclosure.</li></ul>
 <p></p>

<p>empowering you to choose-<br>
   </p><ul><li>  whether and how certain personal information you provide is used
       (where such use is unrelated to the uses for which you originally
       disclosed it); and</li>
  <li>    whether and the manner in which a third party uses certain
       personal information you provide (where such use is unrelated to
       the uses for which you originally disclosed it).</li></ul><p></p>
       
     <p>assuring you that JT.ORG-<br>
   </p><ul><li>   takes reasonable precautions to protect personal information from
       loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or
       destruction;</li>
    <li>  implements reasonable policies and procedures to ensure that
       personal information is kept only for the purposes for which it
       has been gathered;</li>
   <li>   uses reasonable measures to ensure that we have accurately and
       completely recorded the personal information you have provided;
       and</li>
   <li>   provides you reasonable access to your personal information as
       well as procedures for correcting or modifying that information
       where appropriate.</li></ul><p></p>
       
     <p>ensuring accountability to individuals who believe that JT.ORG 
     has not complied with these privacy principles.</p>
     
     <p>If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Statement, please
     contact privacy@jt.org</p>
     
     <p>Getting To Know Our Customers</p>
     
     <p>JT.ORG is in the business of putting people in touch
     with other people. That requires more than simply offering
     innovative technical services. It also requires that we understand
     you, our customer, and your needs. Indeed, we are the Internet's
     leading fan site because we have taken the time to get
     acquainted with each one of our many customers.</p>
     
     <p>We get to know you primarily through the information you provide to
     us when signing up for, or using, one or more of our services. The
     information you provide ranges from basic contact information, to
     payment information, to the technical coordinates of your host
     servers. All of the information we request from you when purchasing 
     our services is obligatory unless otherwise noted on the relevant form. 
     When you purchase our services, you agree to provide and maintain accurate,
     complete and updated information.</p>
     
     <p>After you've signed up for our services, we may be in communication
     with you about your account, technical questions you may have about
     services provided by us, or any other matter relating to those
     services. Those communications are essential to our relationship
     with you and to our ability to provide you with quality services
     that are responsive to your needs. At the same time, those
     communications give us helpful insights about you, your preferences
     and the ways in which we might improve our services. We therefore
     may maintain this information for future use.</p>
     
     <p>Additionally, for operational and quality assurance purposes, we
     take note of whether and how you use the information and services
     that we provide, such as by recording site traffic patterns and by
     maintaining log files of users' access to site files. Finally, in
     order to provide our interactive services, such as the dot com and
     free mail services and various message boards, we store your
     messages to or from other people.</p>
     
     <p>The information we receive from or about you is stored on systems
     designed to prevent the loss, misuse, unauthorized access,
     disclosure, alteration or destruction of that information. We also
     encrypt your transmission of sensitive information to us (e.g.,
     credit card numbers, account passwords) in the interest of
     heightened privacy protection and information integrity.</p>
     
     <p>Information Corrections Or Changes</p>
     
     <p>You have the ability to correct or change certain information in
     our records, such as your address and contact information. 
     You may change this information at any time and as often as necessary. 
     If you need assistance or have questions about correcting information, 
     you can contact us via e-mail.</p>
     
     <p>How We Put Information To Good Use</p>
     
     <p>We use information about you for purposes of monitoring and
     improving our internal operations, as well as to ensure that we:
     (i) bill you properly, (ii) administer your account in accordance
     with your agreements with us and (iii) properly perform the
     services you have requested.</p>
     
     <p>We also use the information we collect to monitor and improve our
     internal operations, as well as to improve the experience of users
     in our network of sites. For example, we may correlate Web site
     traffic information with data about individual users. We may also
     break down overall usage statistics according to customers' domain
     names, browser types, and MIME types by reading this information
     from the browser string (information contained in every user's
     browser).</p>
     
     <p>Another example of our use of information to enhance the experience
     of users in our network of sites is our reliance on cookie files.
     We use cookie files to make it easier for users to access our site
     or services. A cookie file is a small data file that certain Web
     sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file
     can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to
     track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a
     cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie
     can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by
     other sites. We use cookies to track user traffic patterns (as
     described above) when you register for JT.ORG services.
     When you register, we may use a cookie to store a unique, random
     user ID. We use this ID to identify you anonymously in our database
     and to track the pages you visit on our site.</p>
     
     <p>If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies,
     you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You may
     refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser; however, some
     of our sites may require a cookie for access.</p>
     
     <p>Finally, we use the information we collect to direct important
     notices and information affecting your account or services, as well
     as to provide general information that may be of interest to you,
     including newsletters, surveys, contest and sweepstake
     announcements, and information about our service or product
     offerings or the offerings of our business affiliates. You may opt
     out of receiving information from us simply by notifying us of your
     desire in accordance with the opt-out instructions contained in any
     information message you receive from us. Note, however, that in
     order to fulfill our service obligations to you, we must continue
     sending you notices and other important information affecting your
     account or services.</p>
     
     <p>With Whom We May Share Information</p>
     
     <p>We may share certain information about you with those of our
     vendors who are responsible for handling your account or performing
     other necessary services that you require. Although we may share
     sensitive financial information (i.e., credit card numbers, banking
     information), security information (e.g., account passwords) and
     personal communications (e.g., personal e-mail messages or message
     board postings) with such vendors where necessary and appropriate,
     we will not share such information with other third parties, except
     in response to formal requests (e.g., subpoena or court order) made
     in connection with litigation or arbitration proceedings directly
     relating to a domain name registration or other services we
     provide.</p>
     
     <p>Our Accountability To You</p>
     
     <p>By purchasing our services, you obtain the protections of, and
     consent to the data processing practices described in, this Privacy
     Statement. When you purchase our services, you also represent to us
     that you have provided notice to, and obtained consent from, any
     third party individuals whose personal data you supply to us with
     regard to: (i) the purposes for which such third party's personal
     data have been collected, (ii) the intended recipients or
     categories of recipients of the third party's personal data, (iii)
     which of the third party's data are obligatory and which data, if
     any, are voluntary, and (iv) how the third party can access and, if
     necessary, rectify the data held about them.</p>
     
     <p>In addition to the privacy protections that we provide, our
     employees, agents and business partners are independently
     responsible for ensuring compliance with this Privacy Statement, as
     described below.</p>
     
     <p>Employee Accountability</p>
     
     <p>Only those JT.ORG employees that have a legitimate
     business purpose for accessing and handling personal information
     obtained by us are given authorization to do so. The unauthorized
     access or use of such information by a JT.ORG employee
     is prohibited and constitutes grounds for disciplinary action.</p>
     
     <p>Additionally, our information management systems are configured in
     such a way as to block or inhibit employees from accessing
     information that they have no authority to access.</p>
     
     <p>The Accountability of JT.ORG's Agents and Business
     Partners</p>
     
     <p>Our trusted vendors and business partners are responsible for
     processing or handling some of the information that we receive.
     These vendors and business partners are not authorized to use such
     information for purposes beyond those specified by us and are
     required to preserve the confidentiality with which we treat such
     information.</p>
     
     <p>If you feel that JT.ORG, or any of our agents,
     representatives or employees, is violating this Privacy Statement,
     please contact us via e-mail at: privacy@jt.org.
