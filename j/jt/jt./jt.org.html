  <p><em>Please note that from time to time we may review and modify our Privacy  Policy. As your visits to the Site will be subject to the Privacy Policy in  effect at the time of your visit, please review this Privacy Policy regularly  to ensure that you are aware of any modifications.</em></p>
<p>This policy is effective as of and was last updated on January 12, 2013.</p>
<ol><li><strong>General</strong><br>
  This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") is designed to inform you  about the type of information that Qology Direct ("Company", "we,"  "our" or "us") may gather about or collect from you in  connection with your use of Qology Direct (this "Site"). It also is  intended to explain the conditions under which we use and disclose that  information, and your rights in relation to that information.<br>
  <br>
</li>
  <li><strong>Children </strong><br>
  This Site is not intended for children under 18 years of age. We do not  knowingly collect personal information from children under 18.<br>
  <br></li>
  <li><strong>Gathering, Use and Disclosure of  Non-Personally-Identifying Information</strong>
  We collect both Non-Personally-Identifying Information and  Personally-Identifying Information from you. "Non-Personally-Identifying  Information" is information that, without the aid of additional  information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity.  "Personally-Identifying Information," by contrast, is information  such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly associated  with a specific person or entity.<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <ol type="A"><li><strong><em>Gathering Non-Personally-Identifying  Information</em></strong></li>
  <ol type="i"><li><strong><em>Web Browsers</em></strong><br>
  Like most site operators, we gather from you Non-Personally-Identifying  Information of the sort that web browsers, depending on their settings, may  make available. That information includes your Internet Protocol  ("IP") address, operating system and browser type, and the locations  of the web pages that you view right before arriving at, while navigating and  immediately after leaving this Site. </li>
  <li><strong><em>Web  Cookies </em></strong><br>
  A <strong>"Web Cookie"</strong> is a string of information that a site  stores on your computer, and that your browser provides to this Site each time  you submit a query to this site. We use Web Cookies to track the pages that you  visit during each Site session, both to help us improve your experiences with  this Site and to help us understand how this Site is being used.<br>
  IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD  SET YOUR BROWSER TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THIS SITE, WITH THE  UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THIS SITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY  WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES. IF YOU REFUSE WEB COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL  RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY. </li>
   <li> <strong><em>Google Interest Based Advertising  Program </em></strong><br>
  In order to enhance your experience when you visit our website, we  participate in the Google Interest-based Advertising Program (the  "Program") to insure that the advertisements on our website  correspond to your interests. We do this by working with Google and other  Program participants who, like us, place ads on our website and those of other  Program Participants. We then share the information we collect using cookies  placed in your browser in order to provide you with targeted advertising when  you visit our websites. You may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting  the Google Advertising Opt Out Page: <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html</a><br></li>
    <li><strong><em>Web Beacons </em></strong><br>
  A <strong>"Web Beacon"</strong> is an object that is embedded in a web page.  It is usually invisible to you but allows site operators to check whether you  have viewed a particular web page or email communication. We may occasionally  place Web Beacons on pages of this Site. You may not decline Web Beacons.  However, they may be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or modifying  your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit  you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.<br>
  <br>

  <li><strong><em>Use of Non-Personally-Identifying  Information </em></strong><br>
  We analyze Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from you to help  us better understand how this Site is being used. By identifying patterns and  trends in usage, we are able to better design this Site to improve your  experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use. We link information  gathered using Web Cookies and Web Beacons to Personally-Identifying  Information.<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong><em>Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying  Information </em></strong><br>
  From time to time, we may also release the Non-Personally-Identifying  Information gathered from you in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report  on trends in the usage of this Site.<br>
  <br>
  </li></ol>
<li><strong><em>Collection, Use and Disclosure of  Personally-Identifying Information</em></strong><br>
  As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is information that can  be directly associated with a specific person or entity.
