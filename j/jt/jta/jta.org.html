            <p><strong>Update March 3, 2009</strong> We are currently revising these policies to reflect recent changes to JTA’s Web site. Please be patient.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains what information the Jewish Telegraph Agency ("JTA" or “we” or “us") collects on our web site, <a href="http://www.jta.org">http://www.jta.org</a> (the “Web Site"),  how we use your information, and your choices. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected at this Web Site, and does not cover any information collected by any other web site or offline by JTA (unless specifically stated) or any other company. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. <br><br> This privacy policy is subject to change from time to time. If the policy is revised substantially, affected registrants/subscribers may receive an e-mail outlining the change.&nbsp; <br><br><strong>Information JTA Collects</strong> <br><br> In order to access certain portions of the Web Site, or if you choose to participate in certain features, such as registering to become a member of JTA, receiving one of our newsletters, ordering publications or making a donation, you may need to register and provide certain personally identifiable information ("PII") about yourself, such as but not limited to your name, address, e-mail address, phone number or credit card information. In addition, we may on occasion provide you the opportunity to provide PII, such as name or e-mail address, of someone else, such as if you choose to e-mail a friend an article or make a donation in the name of someone else. <br><br> In addition, when you visit this Web Site, our web servers automatically collect certain non-PII, such as the number and frequency of visitors to our web pages and the length of their stays, browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our Web Site, and IP addresses (see below for more information on IP addresses). We also may determine the technology available through your browser in order to serve you the most appropriate version of a web page. <br><br> For people who choose to become registered members of JTA, upon completion of the registration process, we will send you a validation e-mail message.&nbsp; <br><br> For subscribers to JTA’s free Daily Briefing, JTA uses a double opt-in process. After you provide your name and e-mail address via our Web site, you will also need to reply to a validation e-mail to fully activate your subscription.&nbsp; <br><br> You will also have the opportunity to elect to receive E-mail Offers sent to you by JTA on behalf of sponsors of JTA. JTA will provide clear ways to stop receiving these e-mails in each e-mail offer it sends. At no time will any PII you have provided JTA with be disclosed to any third party for the purposes of transmitting E-mail offers to you, though we may share information about our readership in aggregate with third parties.&nbsp; <br><br> JTA does not rent, sell, barter or give away its user or member lists or its users’ or members’ names, e-mail addresses or mailing addresses for use by sponsors and other third parties for the purpose of solicitations, unless the user has previously given his or her consent.&nbsp;  <br><br><strong>JTA Does Not Knowingly Collect Information From Children Under Thirteen (null) Years Of Age.</strong> <br><br> This is not a web site directed to children under the age of 13, and JTA does not knowingly collect any PII from children under thirteen (null) years of age. If you are under thirteen (null) years of age, do not send any information about yourself to JTA. If JTA discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided JTA with PII, JTA will delete that child’s PII from its system. <br><br> JTA recommends parental supervision when a child uses the Internet, particularly when a child enters a forum or uses e-mail. We also encourage parents to instruct their children not to give out personal information in these areas.&nbsp; <br><br><strong>Use Of IP Addresses</strong> <br><br> An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer or network when you are on the Internet. When you request pages from this Web Site, our servers log your IP address. JTA may use IP addresses for a number of purposes, such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our business partners or to audit the use of the Web Site.&nbsp; <br><br><strong>Cookies</strong> <br><br> Like most web sites, this Web Site may sometimes make use of browser “cookies.” Cookies are pieces of information that a web site either transfers to your computer’s hard drive or stores temporarily in your computer’s memory for record-keeping purposes (also known as session cookies). JTA does not save PII in cookies. <br><br> JTA primarily utilizes cookies to understand how many of our visitors are repeat visitors or new users and to exclude to the extent possible users from participating more than once in a survey or poll on the Web Site. We may also use cookies to remember your password or otherwise to expedite your logging in to our Web Site. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. If you choose to disable cookies, you may not be able to fully access and take advantage of some features on the Web Site. <br><br> Sponsors may elect to use advertising companies to serve their ads on JTA.org and JTA publications, and sponsors themselves may also place a cookie on a user’s computer. We do not have access to the cookies or their contents that are placed by sponsors or by third-party advertising companies.&nbsp; <br><br><strong>JTA’s Use and Disclosure of Collected Information</strong> <br><br> JTA may use your PII to provide you with the information or content you have requested, to contact you regarding JTA and our products, services and information, or for other purposes disclosed at the time of collection. For instance, we may send you a requested newsletter, or we may contact you for feedback on such newsletters or with regard to making a donation. We may also contact you regarding any problems or questions we have relating to your use of our Web Site, or, in our discretion, to notify you of changes to our Privacy Policy or other policy or terms that affect you and your use of our Web Site. We may also use information about our users, including PII, for internal purposes. <br><br> At no time will any PII you have provided JTA with be disclosed to any third party for the purposes of transmitting E-mail offers to you, though we may share information about our readership in aggregate with third parties. <br><br> If you e-mail someone else an article or otherwise provide someone else’s PII, we will use the information you provide about someone else to send that person the requested e-mail or otherwise fulfill your request, but we will not use the PII you supply us for those activities to send you or your friend any other communications unless otherwise disclosed at the time you provide such information. <br><br> JTA may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on its behalf. Examples include, without limitation, hosting this Web Site, processing credit card transactions, sending communications on our behalf, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and providing customer service. These third parties may have access to this Web Site’s user information, including PII, but only to the extent it is needed to perform their duties and functions. <br><br> JTA may disclose information about its users, including PII, when legally required to do so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation, or to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Web Site and applicable laws. JTA may also disclose such user information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to limit our legal liability or to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interfering with our rights or property or the rights or property of anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. In addition, JTA may disclose user information, including PII, in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, the sale of substantially all of its assets, or other fundamental corporate change. <br><br> JTA may disclose anonymous, aggregated user statistics for a variety of purposes, including describing JTA’s services to prospective partners and other third parties.&nbsp; <br><br> Other than as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we will not contact you with marketing material or share your PII with outside parties unless such use or disclosure is clearly identified at the time you provide your PII or we provide you the opportunity to consent or prohibit such use or disclosure.&nbsp; <br><br><strong>Your Choices</strong> <br><br> If you register for membership in JTA.org or to receive one of our newsletters, you can notify us if at a later time you decide you no longer wish to be registered or receive the newsletter. If you receive the newsletter via e-mail, follow the instructions on how to unsubscribe at the bottom of each e-mail. You can also ask to be removed from any registration or newsletter subscription by e-mailing <script type="text/javascript">
