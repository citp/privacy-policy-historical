### General

This is the official Privacy Policy for Journal Sentinel, Inc. ("JSI," "us," "our," or "we"), the publisher of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Newspaper and various other newspapers and publications and  the owner, operator, and provider   of the various Services that have an authorized link to this Privacy Policy. JSI is a subsidiary of Journal Communications, Inc. ("JCI").  This Privacy Policy governs our collection of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") both online and offline.

We respect your privacy and this Privacy Policy is designed to answer your questions regarding our online and offline information practices and the choices you can make about the way your Personal Information is collected, used and disclosed. This Privacy Policy is incorporated in our TOU by reference.

If you wish to learn about our opt-out and opt-in policies, please send your written request to us via email or postal mail following the instructions below. We will not accept requests via the telephone or facsimile.

  * We may not be able to respond to requests that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.
  * For all requests, include your full name, street address, city, state and zip code.

Attention: Privacy Administrator/Your California Privacy Rights 

Non-affiliated third parties are independent from JSI and JCI and if you wish to receive information about your disclosure choices or stop communications from third parties, you will need to contact those non-affiliated third parties directly.

### 2\. What types of information do we collect and use?

We collect both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information. We collect a variety of Personal Information voluntarily submitted by you via our Services, email, telephone, instant messaging, facsimile, postal mail, texts, mobile applications ("Apps"), or via third party websites such as Facebook, Twitter or other social networking platforms, or in-person. We may also collect Personal Information about other people when you participate in certain programs and features or when you submit news stories or nominations for community awards or recognition that involve other people.

### Personal Information and Non-Personal Information definitions:

Generally, Personal Information is information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as your name, postal address, email address and telephone number, or data that can be reasonably linked to a specific consumer, computer or other device. Non-Personal Information is information that may not directly identify or enable contact of a specific individual, such as an Internet Protocol ("IP") address or mobile device unique identifier, particularly if that data is de-identified (meaning it becomes anonymous). . Aggregated information is also classified as Non-Personal Information because an individual person cannot be identified.  However, Non-Personal Information linked to or associated with Personal Information will also be classified as Personal Information.

## Here a few additional services, features and activities that collect and use your information

#### News Registry

We participate in the News Registry, a content analytics service operated by NewsRight, LLC ("NewsRight") based in the United States. The News Registry collects content usage information and may use cookies and/or clear GIF image tags (also called web beacons) in conjunction with this activity. Your continued readership or use of our Sites means you also accept the privacy policy of the NewsRight News Registry.  Please refer to the NewsRight News Registry privacy policy at <http://www.newsregistry.com/privacycenter/servicepolicy.aspx> for further information.

We use the News Registry to learn more about how our news and editorial content (such as articles, blogs, photos, graphics, video or audio files regarding any subject matter) is used and consumed. The primary purpose of the News Registry is to monitor a User's use of news and editorial content from its initial publication on a Services' webpage (whether accessed via a computer or mobile device), to when news and editorial content is reposted on other websites or online services (such as on Facebook, Twitter or other social networking platforms, blogs, texts, or web-based email systems) or other forms of digital communications. This information will help us understand how best to improve our news and editorial product, distribution of that product, and/or our Services' functions. We also monitor the various uses of content on our Services so that we can exercise and/or enforce our copyright, trademark, contract, or any other rights in or related to such content. Click here for more information about the type of Non-Personal Information the News Registry collects from Users and how it is used. Please refer to the [NewsRight News Registry privacy policy](http://www.newsregistry.com/privacycenter/servicepolicy.aspx) for your opt-out choices.

### How does the NewsRight News Registry work?

The News Registry collects, and uses the following Non-Personal Information for its analytics service: 1) for news and editorial content that is "clicked-to" or posted from another website or source, we collect the identification of the referring URL of that traffic; and 2) log information to help identify how, where and when news and editorial content is accessed or viewed.  Each time you request a webpage that includes news and editorial content monitored by the News Registry, the News Registry's server records information that your browser sends to it, including the identifier of any cookie that the Registry has previously set on your browser (if you have one), the URL of the page where you accessed the content, your IP address (which the Registry uses to infer your general geographic location), your browser and operating system types, and the date and time that the content was accessed).  The News Registry may also enhance or combine information collected about news and editorial content consumption with other analytical sources and data, such as domain name ownership background information, the author, owner, licensor or licensee of the news and editorial content, News Registry data collected from JCI Affiliates, and predictions about a User's age, gender, or other demographics.  We may also disclose aggregated News Registry data to JCI Affiliates.

We reserve the right to fully use, disclose and process any Non-Personal Information collected from you in any manner.

### 5\. How do we tailor and personalize content and advertising on our Services?

Advertising supports the free content, services, features and activities we provide on our Services. We and our Operational Service Providers use cookies, web beacons and other similar technology to enrich your experience on our Services by serving relevant, tailored and personalized advertising and/or content from JSI or JCI to you. Such advertising and content is based on information you provide to us; your use of our content, features and activities; your visits, search, transaction and/or purchase history; visits to our Facebook fan page and/or predictions made about you based on all of these elements. (Click here for information about cookies and web beacons.)

  * Contextual Advertising: For example, we may serve you an advertisement for the annual Auto Show based on a used car dealer ad you just viewed or a search about used cars on one of our Services; this type of relevant advertising based on particular content or search query is called "Contextual Advertising" because it is based on the context of how you use our Services. We do not collect any other information about you for Contextual Advertising.
  * First Party Advertising: Advertising that is tailored or personalized based on a history of your use of content and participation in features and activities on our Services (possibly combined with information from our Facebook fan page or other social network platforms) over time is called "First Party Advertising" because it is based solely on a combination of information we collect from you – not from your visits to other websites or from third parties. We may share such information anonymously with our Advertisers in order to measure the effectiveness of ads on our Services, such as how many Users opened or acted on a particular ad, but this information may be shared our JCI but not with other non-JCI Affiliates.
  * Network Advertising: Information about your use of our Services combined with similar information about your overall Internet usage across different third party websites or online services used to serve tailored and personalized advertising is generally called "Network Advertising." Multiple third party websites and online services are involved in this tailored or personalized advertising process, in essence a "network" of advertising providers. Such information about you could include information about your browser, computer, and/or mobile device and general information about your demographics (whether you have provided such information voluntarily or such information is estimated based on your usage history and interests), such as your gender, age, lifestyle, education, home ownership, geographic location, etc. Click here for more information about how to identify a Network Advertising ad.



### More information on how we use Network Advertising to deliver tailored and personalized advertising to you:

For advertising that is part of a Network Advertising service, you should see a small symbol [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/).

We expect our Operational Service Providers, their service providers and any Advertiser that collects and uses your website usage information for the delivery of Network Advertising on our Services to comply with the industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising and provide you with a clear and prominent notice and explanation how your Personal Information and/or Non-Personal Information are used to deliver tailored and personalized advertising. We also expect such entities to abide by the industry's Self-Regulatory Principles for Multi-Site Data that limits the collection and restricts the use of Personal Information for determining eligibility for employment, credit, health care and insurance.
