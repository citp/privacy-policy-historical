# JS Online Privacy Policy

**Monday, June 3, 2002** Journal Interactive, Journal Sentinel Inc. and JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com are committed to bringing you information tailored to your individual needs, and we recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about you, our customers and prospects. In adopting this customer privacy policy, our intent is to balance our legitimate business interests in collecting and using information and your reasonable expectations of privacy. 

**What personally identifiable information does JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com collect from me?**

JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com collects information in several ways. Some personal information may be gathered when you register for certain sections of our site. During registration, JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com asks for information such as your name, e-mail address, birth date, gender, zip code, and country, and optional information regarding household income. The more information you volunteer, the better we are able to customize your experience. We may also ask you for other information at other times – such as when you enter a contest or promotion, or when you post an online ad. Whenever we collect information about you, we will make an effort to link to our privacy policy. See the paragraph below about "cookies" and what information is collected by means of the use of cookies. 

**How does JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com use my information?**

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our network of sites. This includes personalization services, interactive communications, online shopping and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements. By knowing a little about you, JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com and its partners are able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service to you. 

JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com may deliver targeted advertisements on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers may give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, females over 25 years old). We take the advertisement and display it to users meeting that criteria. In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account information. Only JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com has access to individuals' accounts. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional e-mail. You will only receive special offers via e-mail from JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com if you have not indicated in your account preferences that you would like not to receive them. You can change your account preferences at any time. 

JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com may conduct research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com may share this aggregated data with advertisers or business partners. 

**Who is collecting information?**

When you are on an area of JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Journal Interactive and Journal Sentinel Inc., its divisions, vendors providing hosting services for JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com and/or its third party list managers unless it is specifically stated otherwise. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any other company, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service. 

Promotions that run on JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com may be sponsored by companies other than JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com or may be co-sponsored by JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared. Currently, most JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com promotions are limited to U.S. or North American residents. 

Please be aware that JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com advertisers or Web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those Web sites linked to JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com are not covered by this privacy statement. 

**With whom does JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com share my information?**

As a general rule, JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. The following describes the ways that your information may be disclosed. 

Web servers serving JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com automatically collect information about which pages each user visits and the domain name of visitors. This information is used for internal review, to tailor information to individual visitors and for traffic audits. We also provide this information (as well as information from third-party market researchers) about our users on an aggregated, anonymous basis to our advertisers. Any personally identifiable information provided by subscribers online as part of an advertiser promotion online (i.e. online coupons) may be provided directly to advertisers. 

JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com will only disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors after you have been informed of this disclosure. We will inform you of the disclosures we plan to make of your personal data either before we collect the data or before we transfer it. You will have an opportunity to tell us that you do not want your data disclosed to these other entities. If you tell us this, we may need to exclude you from the particular promotion or other opportunity we are providing to you. The following sections of this policy spell out these principles in greater detail. 

Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. When you request more information about a particular promotion, your e-mail address may be shared with the sponsor of that promotion. If information other than (or in addition to) your e-mail address will be shared with the sponsor, you will be notified at the time such additional information is collected from you. 

If you make a purchase from a store or a merchant, the information obtained during your visit to those stores (including tracking information and cookies as described below as well as the information you give such as your credit card number and contact information) is provided to the merchants. This is to enable transactions to take place. 

Merchants listed on JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com have separate privacy and data collection practices. JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding the merchant, their store, and their privacy policies, return to that store's home page and click on the appropriate link. 

Under confidentiality agreements, JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com may match aggregated user information with third party data. Also, JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com discloses aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. 

A user's personally identifiable information (e.g., name, e-mail address) may be used by JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com for editorial purposes. For example, we may use information provided by you to us as part of an online survey conducted by our editors. 

If we run competitions or contests on the site, you may be required to provide information such as your telephone number and address in order to participate. The exact rules may vary in each case but the specific rules for any contest will state how that information may be used. Unless you have told us that you would prefer not to receive e-mail from us, we may send you e-mails about JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com products, promotions, or services as well as on behalf of other companies. 

Except as stated in this privacy policy or at the time of collection, a user's personally identifiable information will not be transferred to a party outside Journal Interactive and Journal Sentinel Inc., its divisions, its vendors providing Internet hosting services or advertising services or third party list managers unless stated at the time of collection. 

If you do not wish to receive any e-mail or to have us share such information with another party, you may "opt out" at any time by (i) clicking the box on the registration form or the updated membership profile form requesting us not to e-mail you or to share such information, (ii) e-mailing us at [webmaster@JSOnline.com](mailto:webmaster@JSOnline.com) or (iii) contacting us by mail at 333 W. State St., Milwaukee, WI, 53201. 

JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Membership Agreement or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com's rights or property, other JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. 

**What are cookies and how does JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com use them?**

JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com places a "cookie" on the browser of a JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com user's computer to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie can be used to tell when your computer has contacted a Web site; we use the information for editorial purposes and for other purposes such as measuring certain traffic patterns. For example, cookies are used to ensure that you don't see the same ad too many times in a single session. We may also use cookies to track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions and contests. Advertising networks that serve ads into our site may also use their own cookies. 

**Opting-Out of Online Advertising Cookies**

Journal Interactive delivers online advertising on its network of sites. Journal Interactive's ad management system may place cookies on users' hard drives so that their systems can identify your computer. By placing such cookies on your system, the ad management system is able, among other things, to determine automatically whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. It also enables the ad management system to serve you advertisements tailored to things you have shown interest in based on other sites you have visited. 

Some people are uncomfortable with this kind of information gathering. Journal Interactive allows visitors the option to opt-out of advertising cookies. If you do not want the benefits of cookies, there is a simple procedure that allows you to deny or accept this feature. You can make such changes in the preferences/options section of your chosen Web browser(s) software. 

Some advertisers contract with a third-party service to host their ads. In that case, an independent cookie may be used by the third-party service. We do not have a mechanism to allow visitors to opt-out of vendors with whom we do not have a contractual relationship. 

We do not control the privacy policies of our business partners, advertisers, sponsors or other sites to which we provide hyperlinks. JSOnline.com/OnWisconsin.com users should also be aware that, when you voluntarily disclose personal information in chat areas or message boards, that information may be collected by others and may result in unsolicited messages from others. 

**Note for Kids under 13:** Do not send any information about yourself to us – including information like your name, address, or e-mail address. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the event that we learn that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as possible.
