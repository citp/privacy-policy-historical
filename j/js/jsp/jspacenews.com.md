### Cookies and Web Beacons

Jspace News, like many websites, uses cookies to prepare customized Web pages for you. A cookie is a file containing a string of code that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive, to be kept there for later use. With cookies in place, whenever you use your Web browser (such as Internet Explorer, Chrome, AOL or Mozilla Firefox) to connect to Jspace News, our systems are able to recognize you. This enables Jspace News to present you with custom Web pages. So, for example, instead of seeing just a generic welcome page, you see a welcome page with your name on it and information that relates to where you live (your ZIP code) and products or services that reflect your interests.

In addition to Jspace News’ cookies, when you visit Jspace News your computer may receive cookies from our advertisers and from other sites displayed as search results or links. The cookies inserted by those third parties are not covered by Jspace News’ Privacy Policy, but rather, by the policies of those advertisers and outside websites.

Jspace News also uses web beacons (also known as action tags or single pixel gifs) to access Jspace News cookies inside and outside our Web pages and in connection with Jspace News products and services. A web beacon is a transparent image placed on a web page that sends a signal when a person visits that page. This enables us to assess the popularity and effectiveness of the material posted on the Jspace News website. We may also use web beacons in connection with emails sent to Jspace News Subscribers, to let us know whether and when the e-mail was opened. No personal information is transmitted through web beacons.

Jspace News and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies, such as to support Google Analytics as described above, and third-party cookies together to report how your ad impressions, uses of ad services, and interactions with advertising impressions relate to our website. This information is not associated with any personally identifiable information about you, and is used to improve the quality and placement of advertising place on our website. We have implemented remarketing features through Google Analytics that allow for us to advertise online. This allows for third-party vendors, including Google, to show our ads on websites across the Internet. Jspace News and other third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies and third-party cookies (as described below) together to inform, optimize and serve ads based on a user’s past visits to this website.
