  <h2> Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>JSTOR is committed to protecting the privacy of the users of its website,
    including the privacy of users who encounter JSTOR in connection with our
    facilitating the purchase of articles from publishers (the "Publisher
    Sales Service"). To better inform you of our policy concerning user
    privacy, we have adopted the following guidelines, which adhere to the Safe
    Harbor Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Please note
    that these guidelines are subject to change, and any such changes will be
    included on this page and shall become effective 30 days following their
  posting on our website.</p>

  <h4>The Information JSTOR Collects</h4>
  <p>The personal information JSTOR collects will depend on how you are using
    the JSTOR website. To enable your access to the JSTOR website through your
    library or institution, we may collect information concerning the institution's
    internet protocol address or other authentication methods, such as Shibboleth.
    We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information, such
    as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer),
    the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows or Mac), and the
    domain name of your Internet service provider. To facilitate your order through
    the Publisher Sales Service, we collect your name, postal address, email
    address, credit card details, and transactional information. In addition,
    we may collect personally identifiable information through correspondence
    you send to us and through optional surveys we may post on our website. However,
    unless you provide us with personally identifiable information, you remain
    anonymous to us other than by association with an internet protocol address
    or other authentication mechanism.</p>
  <h4>Data Integrity; Use of the Information</h4>
  <p>We use the personal information collected in ways that are compatible with
    the purposes for which it was intended to be used: to enable your use of
    the JSTOR archive; to facilitate the Publisher Sales Service; to respond
    to your inquiries; for system administration, customer support, and troubleshooting
    purposes; for targeted marketing and product service announcements, including
    announcements about services provided by our affiliate organizations such
    as ARTstor, Aluka, Ithaka, and Portico (directed at institutional participation
    in JSTOR); for sending newsletters (also directed at institutional participation
    in JSTOR); to improve the design of our website; to enable us to enforce
    our <a href="/about/terms.html">Terms and Conditions
    of Use</a>; and in aggregate form, to track and analyze site usage. JSTOR
    will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is relevant
    to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.</p>

  <h4>Use of Cookies</h4>
  <p>JSTOR employs "cookie" technology. Cookies are small pieces of
    text that are stored on your computer and act as a tool for controlling certain
    system variables and storing system configuration information in the WWW
    environment. JSTOR uses cookies to store user preferences for viewing and
    printing and to store authentication information. No personal information
    is extracted in the cookie setting process, and we do not use cookies to
    identify what other sites or pages you have visited. We do not involve advertisers,
    who may place a cookie on your browser, in the operation of our site. For
    further information, please see <a href="/about/cookies.html">JSTOR's
  Use of Cookies</a>.</p>
  <h4>Onward Transfer of Information</h4>
  <p>JSTOR may work with other organizations that provide specific services for
    us, such as credit card processing. We only will provide personal information
    necessary for the third party to provide these services for us. These organizations
    may not use personal information except for the purpose of providing these
    services.</p>
    <p>JSTOR occasionally may share institutional contact information with our affiliate
    organizations, such as ARTstor, Ithaka, Aluka, and Portico, to enable institutions
    to learn about services related to those provided by JSTOR which we think
    may be of interest.</p>
    <p>Except in the following special circumstances, JSTOR does not sell or share
    personal information about or the purchasing history of individual users:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>if required to do so by law or if we believe in good faith that such
      action is necessary to comply with the law or a legal proceeding, to protect
      against violations of our Terms and Conditions of Use, or to protect and
      defend our rights and property or the rights and property of publishers
      selling content through the service; </li>
    <li>with service providers with whom we have entered into agreements to assist
      us with our business operations; </li>
    <li>other third parties, such as an institution with which you are affiliated
      or with one of our related organization whose services you may be interested
      in, where you explicitly consent to our sharing your information. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition, JSTOR shares general usage data in aggregated form so that
    no personal information is identifiable to participating libraries, publishers,
    and the general public. JSTOR will provide you all of your retained personal
    information provided at registration (where applicable) on request. </p>

<h4>Your Consent; Opting Out</h4>
<p>By using our website, you consent to the collection and use, in accordance
  with this policy, of the information you provide to us. We will remove you
  and your personally identifiable information from our database or refrain from
  using your personally identifiable information in connection with certain services
  on request if you contact us with your request at <a href="mailto:support@jstor.org">support@jstor.org</a>. Please note that this may prevent you from accessing the JSTOR archive or using the Publisher Sales Service.</p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>We protect your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure
  through the use of passwords, physical security measures, managerial measures,
  and (in connection with credit card information for order sales through the
  Publisher Sales Service) encryption. We nonetheless recognize that third parties
  may obtain access to information through unlawful actions, and thus do not
  promise that your information always will remain private, despite our efforts
  and the importance we place on maintaining your privacy. In addition, we do
  not claim any responsibility for information collected by or from websites
  linking to or from JSTOR.</p>
  
<h4>Access and Correction</h4>
<p>If you would like to review or update your information, you may contact us using
  the contact information below. We will take reasonable steps to permit you
  to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate.
  You will need to provide sufficient identifying information, such as your name
  and email address and possible additional identifying information as a security
  precaution. We may limit or deny access to personal information where providing
  such access would be unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances,
  or as otherwise permitted by the Safe Harbor principles. </p>
  
<h4>Enforcement and Dispute Resolution</h4>
  <p>We engage in periodic self-assessment to ensure compliance with our Privacy
    Policy. We verify that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information
    intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented, and
    in conformity with the Safe Harbor Principles. We encourage interested persons
    to raise any concerns with us using the contact information below. We will
    investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use
    and disclosure of personal information in accordance with the principles
    contained in this policy.</p>
<p>Any claim arising out of or relating to our adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles,
  or the breach thereof, that cannot be resolved through our internal processes
  will be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association
  in accordance with its applicable commercial rules. Any arbitrator will
  be either an attorney or retired judge having significant and recognized experience
  with and knowledge of privacy issues and information technology. The
  arbitration panel should apply New York law, without regard to its conflict
  of laws principles, as well as the Safe Harbor Enforcement Principles issued
  by the U.S. Department of Commerce (<a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/SHPRINCIPLESFINAL.htm">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/SHPRINCIPLESFINAL.htm</a>).
  In addition, the exclusive location for such arbitration will be New York,
  New York. All decisions of the arbitration panel will be final and binding
  on the parties, which waive any right to further appeal the arbitration award,
  to the extent an appeal may be lawfully waived.</p>
  <p>As a not-for-profit organization, we are not subject to the jurisdiction of
  the United States Federal Trade Commission, which oversees the implementation
  of Safe Harbor Principles; however, we agree to adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles
  in recognition of their importance in ensuring the protection of user information.</p>
