# JSTOR: Privacy Policy

JSTOR is committed to protecting the privacy of the users of its website, including the privacy of users who encounter JSTOR in connection with our facilitating the purchase of articles from publishers (the "Publisher Sales Service"). To better inform you of our policy concerning user privacy, we have adopted the following guidelines, which adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Please note that these guidelines are subject to change, and any such changes will be included on this page and shall become effective 30 days following their posting on our website.

#### The Information JSTOR Collects

The personal information JSTOR collects will depend on how you are using the JSTOR website. To enable your access to the JSTOR website through your library or institution, we may collect information concerning the institution's internet protocol address or other authentication methods, such as Shibboleth. We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows or Mac), and the domain name of your Internet service provider. To facilitate your order through the Publisher Sales Service, we collect your name, postal address, email address, credit card details, and transactional information. In addition, we may collect personally identifiable information through correspondence you send to us and through optional surveys we may post on our website. However, unless you provide us with personally identifiable information, you remain anonymous to us other than by association with an internet protocol address or other authentication mechanism.

#### Data Integrity; Use of the Information

We use the personal information collected in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was intended to be used: to enable your use of the JSTOR archive; to facilitate the Publisher Sales Service; to respond to your inquiries; for system administration, customer support, and troubleshooting purposes; for targeted marketing and product service announcements, including announcements about services provided by our affiliate organizations such as ARTstor, Aluka, Ithaka, and Portico (directed at institutional participation in JSTOR); for sending newsletters (also directed at institutional participation in JSTOR); to improve the design of our website; to enable us to enforce our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/about/terms.html); and in aggregate form, to track and analyze site usage. JSTOR will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.

#### Use of Cookies

JSTOR employs "cookie" technology. Cookies are small pieces of text that are stored on your computer and act as a tool for controlling certain system variables and storing system configuration information in the WWW environment. JSTOR uses cookies to store user preferences for viewing and printing and to store authentication information. No personal information is extracted in the cookie setting process, and we do not use cookies to identify what other sites or pages you have visited. We do not involve advertisers, who may place a cookie on your browser, in the operation of our site. For further information, please see [JSTOR's Use of Cookies](https://web.archive.org/about/cookies.html).

#### Onward Transfer of Information

JSTOR may work with other organizations that provide specific services for us, such as credit card processing. We only will provide personal information necessary for the third party to provide these services for us. These organizations may not use personal information except for the purpose of providing these services.

JSTOR occasionally may share institutional contact information with our affiliate organizations, such as ARTstor, Ithaka, Aluka, and Portico, to enable institutions to learn about services related to those provided by JSTOR which we think may be of interest.

Except in the following special circumstances, JSTOR does not sell or share personal information about or the purchasing history of individual users:

  * if required to do so by law or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to comply with the law or a legal proceeding, to protect against violations of our Terms and Conditions of Use, or to protect and defend our rights and property or the rights and property of publishers selling content through the service; 
  * with service providers with whom we have entered into agreements to assist us with our business operations; 
  * other third parties, such as an institution with which you are affiliated or with one of our related organization whose services you may be interested in, where you explicitly consent to our sharing your information. 



In addition, JSTOR shares general usage data in aggregated form so that no personal information is identifiable to participating libraries, publishers, and the general public. JSTOR will provide you all of your retained personal information provided at registration (where applicable) on request. 

#### Your Consent; Opting Out

By using our website, you consent to the collection and use, in accordance with this policy, of the information you provide to us. We will remove you and your personally identifiable information from our database or refrain from using your personally identifiable information in connection with certain services on request if you contact us with your request at [support@jstor.org](mailto:support@jstor.org). Please note that this may prevent you from accessing the JSTOR archive or using the Publisher Sales Service.

#### Security

We protect your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure through the use of passwords, physical security measures, managerial measures, and (in connection with credit card information for order sales through the Publisher Sales Service) encryption. We nonetheless recognize that third parties may obtain access to information through unlawful actions, and thus do not promise that your information always will remain private, despite our efforts and the importance we place on maintaining your privacy. In addition, we do not claim any responsibility for information collected by or from websites linking to or from JSTOR.

#### Access and Correction

If you would like to review or update your information, you may contact us using the contact information below. We will take reasonable steps to permit you to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate. You will need to provide sufficient identifying information, such as your name and email address and possible additional identifying information as a security precaution. We may limit or deny access to personal information where providing such access would be unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by the Safe Harbor principles. 

#### Enforcement and Dispute Resolution

We engage in periodic self-assessment to ensure compliance with our Privacy Policy. We verify that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented, and in conformity with the Safe Harbor Principles. We encourage interested persons to raise any concerns with us using the contact information below. We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with the principles contained in this policy.

Any claim arising out of or relating to our adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles, or the breach thereof, that cannot be resolved through our internal processes will be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its applicable commercial rules. Any arbitrator will be either an attorney or retired judge having significant and recognized experience with and knowledge of privacy issues and information technology. The arbitration panel should apply New York law, without regard to its conflict of laws principles, as well as the Safe Harbor Enforcement Principles issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce (<http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/SHPRINCIPLESFINAL.htm>). In addition, the exclusive location for such arbitration will be New York, New York. All decisions of the arbitration panel will be final and binding on the parties, which waive any right to further appeal the arbitration award, to the extent an appeal may be lawfully waived.

As a not-for-profit organization, we are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States Federal Trade Commission, which oversees the implementation of Safe Harbor Principles; however, we agree to adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles in recognition of their importance in ensuring the protection of user information.
