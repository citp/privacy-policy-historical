# JSTOR: Privacy Policy

JSTOR is committed to protecting the privacy of the users of its website. To better inform you of our policy concerning user privacy, we have adopted the following guidelines. Please note that these guidelines are subject to change, and any such changes will be included on this page. 

#### The Information JSTOR Collects

> To facilitate your access to the JSTOR archive, we may collect personally identifiable information, including your name, address (including your Internet Protocol address and email address), and, where applicable, username and password.
> 
> We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows 2000 or Mac OS), and the domain name of your Internet service provider. We also require users to agree to our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20021206152523id_/http%3A//www3.jstor.org/about/terms.html). 

#### Use of the Information

> We use the information you provide to facilitate your use of the JSTOR archive, to respond to your inquiries about JSTOR, to improve the design of our site, for system administration and troubleshooting purposes, to enable us to respond to uses of the JSTOR archive in violation of the JSTOR Terms and Conditions of Use, and to, in aggregated form, track and analyze site usage. 

#### JSTOR'S Use of Cookies

> JSTOR employs "cookie" technology. Cookies are small pieces of text that are stored on your computer and act as a tool for controlling certain system variables and storing system configuration information in the WWW environment. JSTOR uses cookies to store user preferences for viewing and printing and to store authentication information. No personal information is extracted in the cookie setting process, and we do not use cookies to identify what other sites or pages you have visited. We do not involve advertisers, who may place a cookie on your browser, in the operation of our site. For further information, please see [JSTOR's Use of Cookies](https://web.archive.org/web/20021206152523id_/http%3A//www3.jstor.org/about/cookies.html). 

#### Security

> We have appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial measures in place to prevent unauthorized access to the information we collect online. We do not, however, claim any responsibility for information collected by or from websites linking to or from JSTOR. 

#### Sharing Information

> Except in special circumstances, outlined below in Compliance With Legal Proceedings, JSTOR does not share personal information about individual users. JSTOR does share general usage data in aggregated form so that no personal information is identifiable to participating libraries, publishers, and the general public. JSTOR will provide you all of your personal information provided at registration (where applicable) on request. 

#### Compliance With Legal Proceedings

> JSTOR may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to comply with the law or a legal proceeding, to protect against violations of our [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20021206152523id_/http%3A//www3.jstor.org/about/terms.html), or to protect and defend our rights and property or the rights and property of contributors to the JSTOR archive. 

#### Opting Out

> JSTOR will remove you and your personal information from our database on request. Please note that this may cancel your access to the JSTOR archive.

> If you have any inquiries about JSTOR's privacy policy or its implementation, you may contact us at [jstor-info@umich.edu](mailto:jstor-info@umich.edu?subject=JSTOR%27s%20Privacy%20Policy).
