					<b>Privacy Policy<br>
					</b><br>
					Jhoos does not send Spam or sell email addresses.<br>
					<br>
					<b>About Jhoos and the Information We Collect</b><br>
					<br>
					Jhoos is an online social networking community that connects 
					people through networks of friends or making new friends. To 
					accomplish this, our users create their own profiles which 
					are shown to the people in their personal network. A 
					personal network consists of a user's friends as well as the 
					extended group of people that a user is connected to via 
					chains of mutual friends. To fulfill the purpose of this 
					site, some personal information we ask for is displayed to 
					people within these personal networks.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Information Collected/Tracked by Jhoos<br>
					<br>
					Information submitted to Jhoos</b><br>
					<br>
					We reserve the right to send electronic mail to you, for the 
					purpose of informing you of changes or additions to the 
					Service, or of any Jhoos related products and services. We 
					reserve the right to disclose information about your usage 
					of the Service and demographics in forms that do not reveal 
					your personal identity.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Information not Directly Submitted by Users to Jhoos</b><br>
					<br>
					This is information we collect that is not personally 
					identifiable, such as browser type and IP address. This 
					information is gathered for all users to the site.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Use of Information Obtained by Jhoos<br>
					<br>
					Information users submit to Jhoos</b><br>
					<br>
					Profile information as well as first name and photos are 
					displayed to people in a user's personal network, to support 
					the function of the site as social networking community 
					where users can meet new people through their friends. Email 
					address and full name are used when a user invites a friend 
					via email to join the service, when a user requests to add 
					another user to their friend list, and when we send 
					notifications to a user related to their use of the service. 
					Except when inviting or adding friends, a user's email 
					address is not shared or displayed with people within a 
					user's personal network. Users within a personal network 
					communicate on Jhoos with each other through the Jhoos 
					service, without disclosing email addresses. We may also use 
					a user's email address to send weekly updates or news 
					regarding our site, but the user may choose not to receive 
					email of this type by accessing their Account Info.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Information that users do not submit to us</b><br>
					<br>
					We use your server, IP address, and browser-type related 
					information in the general administration of our website.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks</b><br>
					<br>
					Except where you are expressly informed otherwise, we do not 
					sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal 
					information unless required by law or for the protection of 
					your membership.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Links</b><br>
					<br>
					This site may contain links to other websites. Please be 
					aware that Jhoos is not responsible for the privacy 
					practices of other Web sites. We encourage our users to be 
					aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy 
					statements of each and every web site that collects 
					personally identifiable information. This privacy statement 
					applies solely to information collected by this Web site.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Use of Cookies</b><br>
					<br>
					A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer 
					tied to information about the user. We use both session ID 
					cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, 
					once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. 
					A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the 
					user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent 
					cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help 
					file directions. Cookies are used to manage sessions on our 
					site. Users must enable cookies to use our site. Also, users 
					may optionally use a cookie to remember their password in 
					order to automatically log in to our site. We do not and 
					will not use cookies to collect private information from any 
					user which they did not intentionally submit to us.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Correcting/Updating or Removing Information</b><br>
					<br>
					Jhoos users may modify or remove any of their personal 
					information at any time by logging into their account and 
					accessing features such as Edit Profile and Account Info.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Changes in Our Privacy Policy</b><br>
					<br>
					If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes 
					on our web site so our users are always aware of what 
					information we collect, how we use it, and under what 
					circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we are going to 
					use users' personally identifiable information in a manner 
					different from that stated at the time of collection we will 
					notify users via email.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Invite a Friend</b><br>
					<br>
					If you invite another person to join Jhoos, we use the name 
					and email address you provide us to contact that person and, 
					if necessary, remind that person that he or she has been 
					invited to join Jhoos. Jhoos stores this email address for 
					the purpose of automatically adding the respondent to the 
					friends list of the user sending the invitation, and also to 
					send reminders of the invitation. Jhoos does not sell these 
					email addresses or use them to send any other communication 
					besides invitations and invitation reminders. All invitees 
					are given the option not to receive further invitations from 
					Jhoos.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Chat Rooms, Message Boards, and Public Forums</b><br>
					<br>
					Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose 
					personal information online - for example on message boards, 
					through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be 
					collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal 
					information online that is publicly accessible, you may 
					receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Security</b><br>
					<br>
					Your Jhoos account is password-protected. This web site 
					takes every precaution to protect our users' information. We 
					use industry standard measures to protect your information 
					that is stored within our database. We limit the access to 
					your information to those employees who need access to 
					perform their job function such as our customer service 
					personnel. If you have any questions about the security at 
					our website, please contact us.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Communications being sent out by Jhoos:</b><br>
					<br>
					The following kind of emails are sent out to members:<br>
					Invite Emails (sent by members to people on their friends 
					list)<br>
					Reminder Emails<br>
					Birthday Greeting<br>
					Account Information<br>
					<br>
					<b>Email Choice/Opt-out<br>
					</b><br>
					Users who no longer wish to receive our weekly updates or 
					news may opt-out of receiving these communications by 
					following the instructions contained in the email.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Third Party Advertising</b><br>
					<br>
					The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by 
					our Web advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners 
					may set cookies. Doing this allows the ad network to 
					recognize your computer each time they send you an online 
					advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile 
					information about where you, or others who are using your 
					computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads 
					are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to 
					deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of 
					most interest to you. Jhoos does not have access to or 
					control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party 
					ad servers or ad networks This privacy statement covers the 
					use of cookies by Jhoos and does not cover the use of 
					cookies by any advertisers.<br>
					<br>
					* Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads 
					on your site.<br>
					* Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to 
					your users based on their visit to your sites and other 
					sites on the Internet.<br>
