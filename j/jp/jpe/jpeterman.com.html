This document is organized as follows: <br></p> <p><br> 1. What information do we collect?<br> 2. How do we use this information?<br> 3. How do we store this information?<br> 4. Do we collect personal information of young children?<br> 5. How can you edit your personal information?<br> 6. How can you access us from outside the U.S.?<br> 7. How do you contact us?</p> <br> <p><br><b>1. What information do we collect?</b><br> <br> You may submit personal information to our website in numerous ways. First, you may share your name, email address and certain information about your likes and dislikes when you sign up for our website, or request a newsletter. We collect information when you register or update your account, log-in, place an order, opt-in to receive our emails, shop online, request a catalog, or participate in a contest, promotion or survey. This information may include, but is not limited to, name, email address, billing and shipping address, credit card information and phone number. You may also provide personal information when you post comments to jpeterman.com, or to one of our other branded sites. In addition, if you have registered with another of our owned and operated sites, we will have any personal information about you that you provided at the sister site(s) as well. Whether or not you provide personal information is your choice; however, sometimes it may be required to participate in a particular activity or gain access to certain content on our sites.<br></p> <br> <p>We also automatically collect general information, or what we call non-personal information, from you when you access our website. This information can include, among other things, the type of browser you are using, the third party website from which your visit originated, the operating system you are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider, the search terms you use on our website, the specific web pages you visit, and the duration of your visits.<br></p> <br> <p><b>2. How do we use this information?</b><br> <br> We will not sell, rent or share your email address with third parties to send you unsolicited email. However, in our ongoing effort to provide you with the best service possible, we may share your information with our other brands within our company.<br></p> <br> <p>When you supply your postal address, either when requesting a catalog or placing an order, you may receive a catalog by mail from us or one of our other brands. We occasionally make our postal list available for limited use by a few reputable and carefully screened firms, but at your request, we will not share your postal address with anyone. Requests can be sent to the <a href="http://www.jpeterman.com/contact-us.asp">contact us</a> page.</p> <br> <br> <p>When you place an order on jpeterman.com, we use this information to process and track your order and contact you via email, postal mail or phone if we have any questions or concerns regarding your order. If you provide an email address during checkout, you will also receive order and shipping confirmation emails.</p> <br> <br> <p>We also maintain a record of your purchases made on our site and through our family of websites and combine this with information you have provided over the phone in order to serve you better. We may combine information you provide with demographic information, information gathered from our other brands and affiliated companies, and information that is publicly available. We may also use information about your product preferences and interests in order to improve our site design and enhance your shopping experience.<br> <br> When we offer contests, promotions or surveys, you may be required to provide certain personal information so we can notify winners and/or fulfill promotional obligations. In these instances, you have the option to receive emails or other communications from us regarding our products, services, contests, and promotions.

The situations explained below are the only times where we may share your personal information with a third party outside of the company or an approved vendor of the company performing a specific task or function on behalf of the company (and these companies will not own or control your personal data on a permanent basis and they can only use your data for the task assigned to them by the company). Those situations are as follows:<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. in response to a legal process and/or where we (or an enforcement agency) believe your actions may violate applicable laws, or where we believe your actions threaten the rights, property or safety of our company, its users (or the general public).<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. you volunteered your personal information to the general public while participating in certain activities on our website, for example, forums, posts, and/or reviews. We cannot control the actions of our site users and recommend you consider this prior to sharing any personal information with the general community on our site.<br> <br> We may also use an approved J. Peterman vendor to help us analyze general information about your visit to our site, which is used by us to understand your shopping experience and preferences. One of our approved vendors may place a unique cookie on your browser, and may also use other monitoring technologies to create anonymous statistics about our website visitors. We also use non-personal information to analyze site traffic, audience trends, etc, and may use an approved J. Peterman vendor to help us complete these tasks as well.<br> <br> We may also send you marketing emails. At various points on our site you have the option to join our email list. Also, if you provide us with your email address either on the home page, when you register, place an order, enter a contest or during checkout, you may automatically be added to our email list as well and receive marketing or promotional information from us or one of our other brands. If you do not wish to receive our marketing emails, you may opt-out by clicking on the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of all our marketing emails, or requests can be sent to the <a href="http://www.jpeterman.com/contact-us.asp">contact us</a> page. <br> <br> <b>3.
