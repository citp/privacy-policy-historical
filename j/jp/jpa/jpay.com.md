Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy governs your JPay account and any information you provide to JPay on this site, on transaction forms or when you speak to a JPay representative. In order to use the JPay service and to reduce the risk of fraud, JPay requires you to provide information about yourself and your credit card and/or debit card (“Bank card”). JPay is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please read this Privacy Policy to understand how your personal information will be collected and used by JPay. This policy was last updated February 19, 2010.

**Information We Collect and Use**

We collect personal information to process transactions, provide products and services, and administer our business. If you contact us we may keep a record of that correspondence and incorporate the information it contains into our database. Information provided by you to open a JPay account, such as your name, address, phone number, Bank Card information and such other information we may collect are retained in the JPay database. Additional information concerning each transaction, such as the amount of the transaction or inmate information such as inmate’s ID or inmate’s last name, are also stored in the JPay database.

Every time you visit our web site a log file is generated which contains information such as your IP (Internet Protocol) address, detail about which pages of JPay.com you visited and for how long. We collect this information to help us diagnose problems and administer our systems, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site (e.g. what part of the world users are connecting from, or what ISPs are being used). Use of this information for marketing purposes will always be in compliance with the applicable law regarding customer consent. 

We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that you remain anonymous even though we include your IP address in our aggregate information. However, we can and will attempt to use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our User Agreement, comply with a governmental request or to protect our services and other users. 

**Cookies**

Cookies are small files of data that reside on your computer and allow us to recognize you as a JPay customer if you return to the JPay site using the same computer and browser. We do link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We send a session cookie to your computer if and when you log in to your JPay account by entering your email address and password. These cookies allow us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages in our site during the same session, so that you don't need to re-enter your password multiple times. Once you log out or close your browser, these session cookies expire and no longer have any effect. You are free to decline cookies if your web browser permits, but you may not be able to use all the features and the functionality of our website. 

**Verification and Disclosure of Information**

In order to protect all of our customers from potential fraud, we verify the information you provide us with third parties. The verification process allows JPay to collect specific information about you in order to safeguard your personal information and any information related to a transaction. In particular, if you register a Bank Card with JPay, we will use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address matches the information that you supplied to JPay, and that the card has not been lost or stolen. Inmate information provided to us is validated against the appropriate correctional institution’s inmate database. 

JPay will only disclose personally identifiable information to third parties under the following circumstances. JPay shares information with companies that help us process transactions such as credit card processors, Wire Transfer Money Order merchants or banking authorities. These third parties are not allowed to use your information for any secondary purposes. JPay may also disclose information that we in good faith believe is necessary to investigate fraud or illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our User Agreement. JPay will disclose information requested by a regulatory or government authority investigating illegal activities. Similarly, we will disclose your personal information whereby our company or business assets are transferred to a third party or if we are compelled to do so by law. 

**Business Transitions**

In the event JPay goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be amongst the assets transferred. The surviving company, or the acquiring company in the case of a sale of assets, would have access to personal information which would continue to be subject to this Privacy Policy. You will be notified via email or through a prominent notice on our website of any such change in ownership or control affecting your personal information.

**How We Protect Information**

JPay is committed to taking every necessary precaution to protect your information. We employ physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect customer information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. JPay restricts access to your personally identifiable information to employees who need to know that information in order to provide services for you. Your account information is stored only in encrypted form on offline computers. JPay continually reviews and enhances its security systems and physical access control procedures.

There are areas of our website where you may be asked to transmit Bank Card information in order to complete a transaction or for verification purposes. Any time we ask for Bank Card information, it will be transmitted in an encrypted format using industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) 3.0/TLS (transport layer security) 1.0 encryption. 

**How You Can Help Us Protect Your Information**

Remember to log out and close your browser window when you have finished using JPay’s services. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. 

**External Links**

This site contains links to other sites and if you decide to follow those links, JPay will not be responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those websites. 

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a revised version on our website. The revised version will be effective at the time we post it. In addition, if the revised version contains a substantial change, we will email you the substantial change prior to posting it on our website.

**Updating Your Information**

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire to use our service, you may email our Customer Support Team at [support@jpay.com](mailto:support@jpay.com).
