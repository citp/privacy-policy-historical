# Lizard Point Quizzes - Privacy Policy

  
Lizard Point Quizzes takes online privacy seriously. Please read the following to understand what information is collected and how it is used. 

Pages on this website use Google Analytics to track demographic information (such as the visitor's country), technology information (such as browser and operating system), and pages visited. This information is only shown to Lizard Point Quizzes in aggregate form. Lizard Point does not see an individual's information or activity while visiting this site. 

If you register for an account on Lizard Point, you will be asked for a user name and email address. This information is used to maintain your access to your account, to facilitate signing in and retrieving a lost password/resetting a password. The email address, with your permission, will be used to notify you of new quizzes and site features. Your email address will not be shared with third parties. If you sign in to your account, the quizzes you complete are recorded in order that we can provide you with the Personalized Quiz Tracker service. Your IP address is recorded with each sign in, and with each quiz that is completed, and is only used by us to maintain site integrity and security.

If you create custom quizzes on Lizard Point, your user name will be displayed on a publicly accessible page as the creator of that quiz. There may be other functions in the future in which your user name could be displayed, such as competition rankings. If you have privacy concerns, we recommend that you **do not use your real name or identifying information as your user name**. 

If you do not register for an account, we do not ask you for any personal information such as your name or email address. If you share that information with us by sending an email, rest assured that the information will not be used for anything except to reply to you.

If you make a donation or payment to Lizard Point Quizzes through our payment processor, PayPal, we at Lizard Point do not receive any information about your credit card or banking information. The details of your transaction through PayPal may include your name and address, and this information will only be used by us for tax compliance.

## Student Accounts

Lizard Point Quizzes offers special services to educators. Each of these services involves the creation and use of student accounts. Student Accounts are either Generated accounts or Student-owned accounts. Generated accounts are intended for students under 13 years old – or where the educator has special concerns about student privacy. 

Generated accounts are intended not to hold any student PII (Personally Identifiable Information). Usernames are generated to be anonymous (e.g. student01, student02 etc…). Furthermore, we do not require email addresses for students using generated student accounts. It is incumbent on the educator to manage and distribute usernames and credentials among students. **Special Note:** For educator convenience, we allow teachers to add an ‘alias’ field for each student account. This may be used by the teacher to aid in reconciling accounts to students (for instance it may contain a student seating code or a student number). **We strongly discourage teachers from using any identifiable information in this field.**

Student-owned accounts are registered by the student using their own email addresses. Students may use their own discretion in creating their usernames – but we advise those with privacy concerns not to use their real, full name. After students create their accounts they may voluntarily connect these accounts with a teacher’s class account after agreeing to share their quiz results. Teachers may request students to enter in an alias to aid in reconciling accounts to students. Once again, **we strongly discourage use of any identifiable information in this field.**
