PRIVACY & SECURITY  
LIDS knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting Lids you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice. 

What is the LIDS safe shopping guarantee?  ([Top](https://web.archive.org/privacy_policy.html#top))  
The Lids Safe Shopping Guarantee protects you while you shop at Lids so that you never have to worry about credit card safety. We guarantee that every transaction you make at Lids will be safe. This means that you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at Lids. 

Guarantee Details: 

  1. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50, Lids will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50. Lids will cover this liability only if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made at Lids while using the secure server.
  2. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
  3. Our liability if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at Lids is limited to $50 or the lesser amount for which your bank holds you liable. We are not liable for any incidental or consequential damages you may incur in connection with the unauthorized charges or for any amount in excess of $50 that your bank may require you to pay because you failed to comply with the bank's rules and procedures concerning the unauthorized charge.



What personal information about customers does Lids gather?  ([Top](https://web.archive.org/privacy_policy.html#top))  
The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at Lids. Here are the types of information we gather: 

  * Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. Scroll to the bottom of this page to see examples of what we collect. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you.
  * Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies" and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Lids.Scroll to the bottom of this page to see examples of the information we receive. A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at Lids if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.
  * E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Lids if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please notify us by sending an e-mail to [contactus@hatworld.com](mailto:contactus@hatworld.com).
  * Information from Other Sources: For reasons such as improving personalization of our service (for example, providing better product recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you), we might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. We also sometimes receive updated delivery and address information from other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily.



What about cookies?  ([Top](https://web.archive.org/privacy_policy.html#top))  
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits. 

The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of Lids coolest features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on. 

Does Lids share the information it receives?  ([Top](https://web.archive.org/privacy_policy.html#top))  
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and **we are not in the business of selling information about our customers to others**. We share information only within the group of companies controlling, under common control with, or controlled by Hat World, INC. 

  * Agents: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
  * Promotional Offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of Lids customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please notify us by sending an e-mail to [contactus@hatworld.com](mailto:contactus@hatworld.com).
  * Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that Lids, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  * Protection of Lids and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Lids, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
  * With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.



How secure is information about me?  ([Top](https://web.archive.org/privacy_policy.html#top))
