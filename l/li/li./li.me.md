Privacy Notice  
Effective: June 25, 2019

At Lime and our family of companies (collectively “ **Lime** ,” “ **we** ,” “ **us** ,” or “ **our** ”) we are strongly committed to transparency, and we want you (“ **you** ” or “ **your** ”) to understand how we collect, use, share and protect your information. This Privacy Notice (“ **Privacy Notice** ”) describes how Lime handles information in connection with Lime’s websites and related mobile applications and services (collectively, the “ **Services** ”), and when you otherwise interact with us. When specified, this policy also describes our data practices related to Juicers. Please also read our [Terms of Service](https://www.li.me/user-agreement) which set out the terms governing the Services.

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Notice from time to time. If Lime makes changes to this Privacy Notice, the updated Privacy Notice will be made available through our Services and if we make any material changes to this Privacy Notice, we will provide a prominent notice and may also contact you directly by email or another method.

 **The Types of Information We Collect**

We collect or receive information in different ways. The types of information we collect or receive depends on how you use and interact with our Services. In many cases, you can choose the  information you provide to us, although certain information is required for us to provide the Services. We use and disclose this information for the purposes described further below. The types of information we collect include:

  *  **Account Information** such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number and payment information such as your credit card details. In order to use certain products, we may also require you to provide a copy of your driving license. To avail of [Lime Access](https://www.li.me/community-impact), we also collect government-issued ID and proof of low income status for verification purposes.
  * We collect and process **location data** when you sign up and use the Services. For example, to show you Lime bikes or scooters near your location, it is necessary to collect and record the physical location of your device. Data such as the location of the bike or scooter, the routes taken by the bike or scooter, and its rental status are also necessary to provide the Services. Lime also collects location data directly from Lime bikes or scooters including when a Lime user is riding, such as journey information. 
  * If you link, connect, or login to Lime with a **third party service** (e.g. Facebook), the third party service may send us information such as your profile information or friends list from that service.
  * When you ask for customer service, support or other assistance, you can choose to provide us with your **contact information** so we can better respond to your requests and we may keep information about your engagement with our support services.
