<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Lijit takes the privacy and protection of
personal information very seriously. By using the Lijit Services, we may
collect information about you and use and disclose such information, as
described in this privacy policy (<b>Privacy Policy</b>). Any capitalized terms
not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in the <a href="http://www.lijit.com/legal_terms"><span style="color:windowtext">Legal

<p style="line-height:16.5pt;background:white"><b><span style="color:windowtext">What
This Privacy Policy Covers</span></b><span style="color:windowtext"> </span></p>

<p style="line-height:16.5pt;background:white"><span style="color:windowtext">This
Privacy Policy describes Lijit's use of Personal Information and Anonymous
Information that we collect when you use the Lijit Services. We collect and use
Personal Information and Anonymous Information as described in this Privacy
Policy from Publishers who are natural persons, websites or publications where
Lijit Services may reside, and Readers who may or may not use the Lijit
Services. "<b>Personal Information</b>" means contact information
(i.e., name, address, e-mail address, and/or phone number) and any other
non-public information that is associated with the contact information. "<b>Anonymous
Information</b>" means information that is not associated with or linked
to your Personal Information. </span></p>

USING THE LIJIT SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH OUR LIJIT
SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND YOU EXPRESSLY
CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS
PRIVACY POLICY. </span></b></p>

<p style="line-height:16.5pt;background:white"><b><span style="color:windowtext">YOUR
PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS
COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS
REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE
LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.</span></b><span style="color:windowtext"> </span></p>

<p style="line-height:16.5pt;background:white"><b><span style="color:windowtext">Personal
Information You Provide to Us</span></b></p>

<p style="line-height:16.5pt;background:white"><span style="color:windowtext">The
Personal Information we gather from you helps us provide the services you
request and learn more about the use of the Lijit Services. We collect the
following Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily: </span></p>

<p style="line-height:16.5pt;background:white"><span style="color:windowtext">Our
registration process requires you to provide Lijit with a valid email address
and a username and password of your choice, among other information. We may
also request optional information to support your use of the Services, such as
your first and last name, year of birth, zip code, and country of residence.
When you sign up to receive a Lijit newsletter, we will collect your email
address. When you contact us by sending us an email, we will collect any
information that is contained in your email. When you create an account as a
Publisher, we collect your username and password. We may collect information
about the categories of Content you typically make available to others. We may
collect information related to your PayPal account from you if you, as a
Purchaser, participate in our advertising network. If you, as a Publisher or
Reader, sign up for a Lijit Alert or newsletter, we collect your email address.
</span></p>

<p style="line-height:16.5pt;background:white"><span style="color:windowtext">You
can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the
features of the Lijit Services you are able to use. </span></p>

<p style="line-height:16.5pt;background:white"><b><span style="color:windowtext">Information
Collected Via Technology</span></b><span style="color:windowtext"> </span></p>

<p style="line-height:16.5pt;background:white"><span style="color:windowtext">As
you use the Lijit Services as a Publisher or Reader, certain information may
also be collected passively (as described in this Section), including your
Internet protocol (IP) address, browser type, and operating system. Lijit
stores a small text file called a <b>Cookie</b> on your computer: (1) to store
your login information, if applicable, and (2) in conjunction with the Wijit
and/or Lijit Services, including when you as a Reader choose to opt out of such
services (see below). Lijit may use both session Cookies (which expire once you
close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer
until you delete them). With respect to Publishers, we collect Personal
Information about Content you add to your Wijit-enabled pages. For example, we
categorize the types of Content you make available. With respect to Readers, we
collect information about the pages you view as a Reader and the search queries
you submit as a Reader through technologies that do not identify you as an
individual. Unless you, as a Reader, voluntarily provide us with Personal
Information (such as your email address for Lijit newsletters or Lijit Alerts),
we collect only Anonymous Information from you. We may also enable advertisers
and ad servers to promote third party products and/or services by placing
advertisements on the Lijit Services and Publisher sites. These advertisers and
ad servers may use Cookies and/or "Web Beacons" (which are usually
small, transparent graphic images) in order to monitor information related to
served advertisements. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the
website of a third party and the advertiser. This Privacy Policy does not cover
the privacy practices of any advertisers or ad servers. </span></p>

collect site visit data from that browser until an opt-out cookie is reset on
that browser.</span></p>

<p style="line-height:16.5pt;background:white"><span style="color:windowtext">Additionally,
you may prevent us from collecting information on a browser by blocking

of Information We Collect</span></b><span style="color:windowtext"> </span></p>

<p style="line-height:16.5pt;background:white"><span style="color:windowtext">In
general, Personal Information you submit to us is used by us to register you
for our Lijit Services, to respond to requests that you make, to improve our
Lijit Services and to better tailor the features, performance and support of
the Lijit Services, and to offer you additional information, opportunities, and
functionality. We may also use your Personal Information to provide you with
electronic newsletters, "Lijit Alerts", or promotional e-mails,
should you request to receive such communications from us. Unless you indicate
that you do not want Lijit to do so, Lijit may use the username and password
that you use for your Lijit account to log in to other online services on which
you provide content, in order to index the content you have provided on such
services. Lijit will use your payment account information to make payments to
you as part of our advertising network, if applicable.</span></p>

<p style="line-height:16.5pt;background:white"><span style="color:windowtext">One
of the features behind the Lijit Services is that our Publishers may aggregate
existing information about themselves, such that it may be searched by others.
Therefore, you should assume that any information you enter into or post on the
Lijit Services (excluding your registration information) will be openly shared
with Readers. Please be aware that if you enter any Personal Information into
publicly available sections of the Lijit Services, this information will be
displayed to anyone who has access to these sections. </span></p>

<p style="line-height:16.5pt;background:white"><span style="color:windowtext">We
may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding
information (such as your name or email address) that makes the information
personally identifiable to you. We may use Anonymous Information to analyze
usage patterns so that we may enhance our Lijit Services. We reserve the right
to use and disclose Anonymous Information to third parties in our discretion. </span></p>

<p style="line-height:16.5pt;background:white"><span style="color:windowtext">We
use Anonymous Information on Readers’ activities at Publisher websites, such as
page views and search queries, to provide aggregate information to Publishers
so that they can improve their offerings and  to present more relevant
advertising to Readers on Publisher websites that participate in our
Advertising Network.</span></p>

may provide your Personal Information to third party service providers who work
on behalf of or with us to provide some of the services and features of the
Lijit Services and to help us communicate with you. Examples of such services
include sending email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance,
processing payments (including credit card payments), and providing customer
service. However, these service providers do not have any independent right to
share this information (except pursuant to a legal requirement such as a
subpoena or warrant). </span></p>

<p style="line-height:16.5pt;background:white"><span style="color:windowtext">We
share Anonymous Information with our partners, advertisers, and other third

assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this
