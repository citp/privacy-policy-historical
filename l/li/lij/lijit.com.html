<span style="font-size: 1.2em;"><strong>Personal Information We Collect</strong></span></p><p>The Personal Information we gather from you helps us learn more about the visitors and Users of our Lijit Services. We collect the following Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily:</p><p>Our registration process requires you to provide Lijit with a valid email address and a username and password of your choice. We may also request optional information, such as your first and last name, year of birth, zip code, and country of residence.
When you sign up to receive the Lijit newsletter, we will collect your email address.
When you contact us by sending us an email, we will collect any information that is contained in your email.</p><p>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the features of the Lijit Services you are able to use.</p><p><br>
<span style="font-size: 1.2em;"><strong>Personal Information Collected Via Technology</strong></span></p><p>As you use the Lijit Services, certain information may also be collected passively, including your Internet protocol (IP) address, browser type, and operation system. Lijit also stores a small text file called a “<strong>Cookie</strong>” on your computer to store your login information. Lijit may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). You must have Cookies enabled in your web browser to use the Lijit Services. </p><p>We may also contract with advertisers in order to promote third party products and/or services by placing advertisements on the Lijit Services. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the website of a third party and the advertiser and/or third party may also use Cookies in connection with these advertisements. This Privacy Policy covers the use of Cookies by Lijit only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. Any advertisements appearing in conjunction with the Lijit Services are delivered by third parties.
