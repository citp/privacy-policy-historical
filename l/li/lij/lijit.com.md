The Personal Information we gather from you helps us provide the services you request and learn more about the use of the Lijit Services. We collect the following Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily: 

Our registration process requires you to provide Lijit with a valid email address and a username and password of your choice, among other information. We may also request optional information to support your use of the Services, such as your first and last name, year of birth, zip code, and country of residence. When you sign up to receive a Lijit newsletter, we will collect your email address. When you contact us by sending us an email, we will collect any information that is contained in your email. When you create an account as a Publisher, we collect your username and password. We may collect information about the categories of Content you typically make available to others. We may collect information related to your PayPal account from you if you, as a Purchaser, participate in our advertising network. If you, as a Publisher or Reader, sign up for a Lijit Alert or newsletter, we collect your email address. 

You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the features of the Lijit Services you are able to use. 

**Information Collected Via Technology**

As you use the Lijit Services as a Publisher or Reader, certain information may also be collected passively (as described in this Section), including your Internet protocol (IP) address, browser type, and operating system. Lijit stores a small text file called a **Cookie** on your computer: (1) to store your login information, if applicable, and (2) in conjunction with the Wijit and/or Lijit Services, including when you as a Reader choose to opt out of such services (see below). Lijit may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). With respect to Publishers, we collect Personal Information about Content you add to your Wijit-enabled pages. For example, we categorize the types of Content you make available. With respect to Readers, we collect information about the pages you view as a Reader and the search queries you submit as a Reader through technologies that do not identify you as an individual. Unless you, as a Reader, voluntarily provide us with Personal Information (such as your email address for Lijit newsletters or Lijit Alerts), we collect only Anonymous Information from you. We may also enable advertisers and ad servers to promote third party products and/or services by placing advertisements on the Lijit Services and Publisher sites. These advertisers and ad servers may use Cookies and/or "Web Beacons" (which are usually small, transparent graphic images) in order to monitor information related to served advertisements. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the website of a third party and the advertiser. This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any advertisers or ad servers. 

**Opting Out**

We make available a Lijit "opt-out" cookie that you may download to your browser. If this cookie is installed on your browser, we will not collect anonymous site visit data on that browser. Click Opt-Out to install this cookie.

Our opt-out tool is cookie-based. This opt-out tool only prevents us from collecting site visit data pertaining to you on the browser on which it is installed, and will only function if your browser is set to accept third-party cookies. If you delete an opt-out cookie from a browser's cookie files, we will collect site visit data from that browser until an opt-out cookie is reset on that browser.

Additionally, you may prevent us from collecting information on a browser by blocking third-party cookies in that browser. If you block third-party cookies from being set on your browser, you may not be able to enjoy some features or functionality of, and you may see the same content and advertisements repeatedly on some Publisher sites. The Lijit opt-out cookie is designed to persist for 25 years.

**Information from Other Sources**

We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources like telephone or fax, from third parties that provide services for us in connection with the Lijit Services, or from third parties that you add to your network. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via the Lijit Services. 

**Use of Information We Collect**

In general, Personal Information you submit to us is used by us to register you for our Lijit Services, to respond to requests that you make, to improve our Lijit Services and to better tailor the features, performance and support of the Lijit Services, and to offer you additional information, opportunities, and functionality. We may also use your Personal Information to provide you with electronic newsletters, "Lijit Alerts", or promotional e-mails, should you request to receive such communications from us. Unless you indicate that you do not want Lijit to do so, Lijit may use the username and password that you use for your Lijit account to log in to other online services on which you provide content, in order to index the content you have provided on such services. Lijit will use your payment account information to make payments to you as part of our advertising network, if applicable.

One of the features behind the Lijit Services is that our Publishers may aggregate existing information about themselves, such that it may be searched by others. Therefore, you should assume that any information you enter into or post on the Lijit Services (excluding your registration information) will be openly shared with Readers. Please be aware that if you enter any Personal Information into publicly available sections of the Lijit Services, this information will be displayed to anyone who has access to these sections. 

We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name or email address) that makes the information personally identifiable to you. We may use Anonymous Information to analyze usage patterns so that we may enhance our Lijit Services. We reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information to third parties in our discretion. 

We use Anonymous Information on Readers’ activities at Publisher websites, such as page views and search queries, to provide aggregate information to Publishers so that they can improve their offerings and to present more relevant advertising to Readers on Publisher websites that participate in our Advertising Network.

**Feedback**

If you provide feedback to us, we may use and disclose such feedback for any purpose, provided we do not associate such feedback with your Personal Information. We will collect any information contained in such feedback and will treat the Personal Information in it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

**Disclosure of Information**

Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not trade, rent, or share the Personal Information that we collect with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so.

Examples of such services include sending email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments (including credit card payments), and providing customer service. However, these service providers do not have any independent right to share this information (except pursuant to a legal requirement such as a subpoena or warrant). 

We share Anonymous Information with our partners, advertisers, and other third parties in our discretion. For example, we may share Anonymous Information related to a specific Cookie to enable advertisers or ad servers to display relevant ads, based on the Content, search terms, and demographic profile viewed in connection with that Cookie.

Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, " **Affiliates** "), we may in the future. We may share some or all of your Personal Information with these Affiliates, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. 

In the event Lijit goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Lijit or its assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. 

We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect and defend the rights or property of Lijit, you, or third parties. You hereby consent to Lijit sharing your Personal Information under the circumstances described herein.
