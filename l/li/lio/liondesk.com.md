##### VIII. Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms 

We use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our website and our services on our website. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you.

**Cookies**. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser for record–keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our website, while others are used to enable a faster log–in process or to allow us to track your activities at our website. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.

  * _Session Cookies_. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the website. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.
  * _Persistent Cookies_. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.



**Disabling Cookies**. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our website who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the website, but some features may not function.

**Local Storage Objects**. We may use Flash Local Storage Objects ("Flash LSOs") to store your website preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose "Global Storage Settings Panel" and follow the instructions. To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose "Website Storage Settings Panel" and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.

**Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies**. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our website to, among other things, track the activities of website visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about website usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e–mails to our customers, to help us track e–mail response rates, identify when our e–mails are viewed, and track whether our e–mails are forwarded.

##### IX. Online Tracking and Behavioral Advertising

We may use third parties such as network advertisers to display advertisements on our websites and to assist us in determining relevant advertising and placement on third party websites. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our website as well as other websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third––party advertisers with information about your usage of our website and our services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our website and users of our services.   
We do not honor browser requests not to be tracked. You may, however, opt–out of many third–party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"). For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt–out of third–party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites: www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp (NAI) and www.aboutads.info/choices (DAA).  
Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our website or other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt–out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt–out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on NAI's and DAA's websites accessible by the above links.

##### X. Third Party Analytics

We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate use of our website. We use these tools to help us improve our website, services, performances, and user experiences. These third party services may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services.

##### XI. How We Protect Your Information

To protect the confidentiality of your PII, LionDesk employs physical, administrative, and technical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of the information and to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access disclosure or modification of PII.

##### XII. Changes to the Privacy Policy

By providing you with this Privacy Statement, LionDesk is pledging our continued commitment to protecting the information you provide us. LionDesk regularly examines our information privacy practices to determine whether we are adhering to the disclosures about the collection, use, sharing, and protection of your PII made in this privacy statement. We may change or supplement this Privacy Policy from time to time. We may also undergo a change of ownership. Privacy Policy changes will apply to the information collected from the date we post the revised Privacy Policy to the website, as well as to existing information held by us.  
If we decide to change this policy in a material way, we will obtain the necessary consents required under applicable privacy laws if we seek to collect, use or disclose PII for purposes materially different than those to which consent has been obtained, unless otherwise required or permitted by law. If any proposed change is unacceptable to you, you may request that we remove your PII from our records, as described above.
