## Data Collection

P3P policies declare the data they collect in groups (also referred to as “statements”). This policy contains three data groups. The data practices of each group will be explained separately.

**Group “Basic Information”**

In general, you can visit the Lionbridge website without providing personal information, but there are times when Lionbridge will request personal information. Personal information is information that individually identifies you, such as your name, telephone number, physical address or email address. Lionbridge may also gather personal information in connection with any contests Lionbridge offers or if you participate in one of its online communities.

Lionbridge Technologies, Inc. is a U.S. based company with offices throughout the world. It is possible that any personally identifiable information collected from you may be transferred to other Lionbridge sites located outside your country of residence that may not have equivalent laws and rules regarding privacy and data protection. We are committed to the security of personally identifiable information and we take reasonable precautions to maintain that protection. Although we use physical and administrative procedures to attempt to safeguard personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee that it is completely secure from people who might attempt to evade security measures or intercept transmissions over the Internet.

Lionbridge collects and uses your information in order to give you better service, to provide you with convenient access to its products and services and to make its website more useful to you. The contact information Lionbridge collects is used, in part, to deliver information about Lionbridge and its partners and promotional material to you. It is also used to contact you when necessary. Information collected through the use of cookies is used to evaluate and improve its website and to help diagnose problems with its server. Lionbridge will only use (such use including disclosure) your personal information without notice when it believes the use to be required by law or regulation, or necessary to protect or defend the rights or property of Lionbridge, the safety of the public or the users of its site, or if you have provided Lionbridge with prior consent to do so (see “Opt-In” below).

## Privacy

Lionbridge currently contracts with several online partners to help manage and optimize its Internet business and communications. Lionbridge uses the services of a marketing company to help it measure the effectiveness of its advertising and how visitors use its site. To do this, Lionbridge uses Web beacons and cookies provided by its marketing company on this site. The type of information Lionbridge collects includes how visitors find its site, the pages they visit, their activities, and where they exit the site. By supplementing its records, this information helps Lionbridge learn things like what pages are most attractive to its visitors and which of its services most interest its customers. Although its marketing company logs the information coming from its site on its behalf, Lionbridge controls how that data may and may not be used. If you do not wish to help Lionbridge learn how to improve its site, products and offers, you can Opt-out of this website analysis tool by emailing Lionbridge at [privacy@lionbridge.com](mailto:privacy@lionbridge.com).

  * send or post e-mail messages which are excessive and/or intended to harass or annoy others
  * continue to send e-mail to a recipient that has indicated that he/she does not wish to receive it
  * send e-mail with forged TCP/IP packet header information

  * take any other actions intended to cloak the your identity or contact information

Lionbridge exercises no control over, and accepts no responsibility for, the content of the information passing through the Lionbridge network, including content provided on any third-party web sites linked to the Lionbridge network. Any web site links are provided as Internet navigation tools for information purposes only and not as an endorsement by Lionbridge of the contents of such web sites. Lionbridge does not adopt, nor warrant the accuracy of, the content of any linked web site and undertakes no responsibility to update the content. Use of any information obtained via the Lionbridge network is at your own risk.

Lionbridge does not screen communications and is not responsible for screening or monitoring content used by you.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Use

Indirect or attempted violations of this Policy, and actual or attempted violations by a third-party on behalf of you, shall be considered violations of this Policy by you. Furthermore, it is a violation of this policy to use the services of another provider for the purposes of facilitating any of the activities described above if such use of another provider’s service could reasonably be expected to affect the Lionbridge network.
