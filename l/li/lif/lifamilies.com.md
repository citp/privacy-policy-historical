Personal data collected by Bridal Planner Group may be used by Bridal Planner Group for editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of users’ behavior, for product development, for content improvement, to inform advertisers as to how many visitors have seen or clicked on their advertisements, or to customize the content and layout of Bridal Planner Group's website. Aggregate data on visitors’ home servers may be used for internal purposes or provided to third parties such as advertisers.

Any third party to which Bridal Planner Group shares, rents, sells, or otherwise discloses personal data will be under a contractual obligation to use the personal data for marketing products and services which Bridal Planner Group determines, in its sole judgment, that visitors might find of interest. Bridal Planner Group will use its reasonable efforts to identify such third parties who may have products or services of interest to visitors to Bridal Planner Group's website. However, such parties are independent third parties over which Bridal Planner Group exercises no control, and therefore Bridal Planner Group is not responsible for their conduct, products, or services, and will not be liable therefor. Bridal Planner Group will disclose to third parties only information in aggregate form, that is publicly available, and/or that is knowingly and voluntarily disclosed by visitors. If there are advertisements on Bridal Planner Group's Web site, through the use of third party cookies, the advertiser(s) will be electronically notified when visitors view or click on its advertisements.
