					<h2>Welcome to LifeLock!</h2>
<p>This LifeLock, Inc.

<blockquote>B. <strong>Personal Information</strong>. Some information ("Personal Information") is not gathered automatically when you access the Website and instead is provided by you voluntarily. Personal Information is information that is identifiable as yours, including without limitation your name, address, telephone number, email address, date of birth, driver's license number, Social Security number, and other personal information to verify your identity, as well as financial information such as your credit card number. You must provide Personal Information to LifeLock as part of the registration process if you wish to receive "Services" as defined in the LifeLock <a href="/about-us/about-lifelock/terms-and-conditions">Terms of Use</a>. The following are some of the kinds of Personal Information you may choose to provide: 
<blockquote><strong>(i)</strong> Registration Information. When you register at the Website, you will be required to provide certain Personal Information;</blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>(iii)</strong> Email Information. When you send LifeLock email messages or call LifeLock by telephone, LifeLock may retain the content of your email or telephone messages, together with your email address and LifeLock's response to you.</blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>C. <strong>Cookies</strong>. Cookies are small text files that are stored by a user's web browser on the hard drive of a user's computer. Cookies can "remember" what information ("Cookie Information") a user accesses on a particular web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that website by the same user, or can use that information to streamline the user's transactions on related websites. The Cookies LifeLock uses on the Website may be "session" Cookies that are erased when you leave the Website, or may be "persistent" Cookies that remain on your computer's hard drive after you leave the Website. LifeLock also uses a Cookie installed by Google, Inc. to provide LifeLock with usage information regarding the Website. The Cookies LifeLock uses do not capture your individual email address or any personally identifying information, but do permit LifeLock to send focused advertising, online banner advertisements, new services, promotions or other such responses to you or assist your use of the Website. LifeLock may also set Cookies when you register at the Website, and may do so without notice to or permission from you or any third party. Third party websites which are accessible from the Website via links, banner ads, or "click-throughs" may also use Cookies, and LifeLock shall have no responsibility whatsoever for such Cookies.</blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>2. <strong>USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</strong>. LifeLock uses and discloses your information as follows: 
<blockquote>A. <strong>General Information</strong>.

In particular, LifeLock may provide General Information about LifeLock customers, sales, Website traffic patterns and related information to LifeLock affiliates or third parties;</blockquote>
<blockquote>B. <strong>Personal Information</strong>. LifeLock shall protect your Personal Information from disclosure to third parties using a reasonable degree of care, and does not otherwise use or disclose your Personal Information except as follows: 
<blockquote><strong>(i)</strong> LifeLock may use your Personal Information and disclose your Personal Information: (a) to a consumer reporting agency representative; (b) in the course of placing a fraud alert; (c) to law enforcement; (d) to an insurance company; (e) to a representative of a payment verification service, financial institution or credit card company; (f) to a consumer reporting agency or other organizations in order to obtain informational credit reports about you or a minor child for whom you have registered for Services; or (g) to third party service providers, such as administrators of a customer rewards program;</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>(ii)</strong> LifeLock may disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of providing you information regarding products and services that LifeLock believes will be of interest to you;</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>(iii)</strong> LifeLock may disclose your Personal Information to LifeLock affiliates for the purpose of administering or performing Services;</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>(iv)</strong> If you registered another person at the Website, LifeLock may share your Personal Information with that person;</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>(v)</strong> LifeLock may use and disclose your Personal Information: (a) in order to help investigate possible misconduct or crime, such as fraud or identity theft; (b) in connection with the sale, purchase, merger or reorganization of LifeLock; or (c) when LifeLock believes it is necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of LifeLock or other persons;</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>(vi)</strong> LifeLock may use and disclose your Personal Information to notify you about changes to the Website or LifeLock business, or new LifeLock services and special offers you may find valuable; and</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>(vii)</strong> LifeLock may transfer your Personal Information to third parties for those parties to use to populate their own website registration forms when you hyperlink from the Website to their websites, in order to save you time in filling out their registration forms.

If you have any questions about security of your Personal Information or the security on the Website, you can send LifeLock an email at <a href="mailto:member.services@lifelock.com">member.services@lifelock.com</a>. You understand and agree that perfect security does not exist anywhere, and you will therefore protect your Personal Information in a reasonable way at all times. Accordingly, you will not recklessly disclose or publish your Social Security number or any other Personal Information to those that would reasonably be expected to improperly use or disclose that Personal Information such as by way of example in response to "phishing" scams, unsolicited emails or pop-up messages seeking disclosure of Personal Information.</blockquote>
