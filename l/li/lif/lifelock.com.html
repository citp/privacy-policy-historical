				<h1>LifeLock Privacy Policy</h1>
				
				<h2>Welcome to LifeLock!</h2>

				<p>This LifeLock, Inc. ("LifeLock") Privacy Policy (the "Policy") was developed as an extension of LifeLock's commitment to combine the highest-quality services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with LifeLock's valued customers, and the companies, businesses and organizations they represent or that represent them (collectively, "you").</p>

				<p><strong><u>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE POLICY, YOU MUST NOT USE THIS INTERNET WEBSITE (THE "WEBSITE"). LIFELOCK MAY MODIFY THE POLICY FROM TIME TO TIME AND POST THOSE MODIFICATIONS HERE AND ON THE HOMEPAGE OF THE WEBSITE. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE WEBSITE AFTER ANY SUCH MODIFICATION CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE MODIFIED POLICY. EACH TIME YOU USE THE WEBSITE, THE LATEST VERSION OF THE POLICY WILL BE DISPLAYED AND WILL APPLY.</u></strong></p>

				<p>As a member, you will be notified of any substantive modifications to the Policy by email, and we will prominently post notice of any such modifications on our website. You understand and agree that you will be bound by all such modifications, if any, regardless of whether you provide such email address or receive such notice.</p>

				<blockquote><strong>1. INFORMATION.</strong> LifeLock obtains information from and about you in a number of different ways, including: 
				<blockquote><strong>A. General Information.</strong> Some information ("General Information") is gathered automatically when you access the Website. This General Information (which may include Website pages visited, type of web browser used, type of operating system, and the domain name of your Internet service provider, and similar information) does not identify you personally. LifeLock also uses log files as well as customer relationship management ("CRM") technologies to collect and analyze General Information and Cookie Information (as defined below).</blockquote>

				<blockquote><strong>B. Personal Information.</strong> Some information ("Personal Information") is not gathered automatically when you access the Website and instead is provided by you voluntarily. Personal Information is information that is identifiable as yours, including without limitation your name, address, telephone number, email address, date of birth, driver’s license number, Social Security number, and other personal information to verify your identity, as well as financial information such as your credit card number. You must provide Personal Information to LifeLock as part of the registration process if you wish to receive "Services" as defined in the <a href="http://www.lifelock.com/about-us/about-lifelock/terms-and-conditions">LifeLock Membership Agreement</a> ("Membership Agreement"). The following are some of the kinds of Personal Information you may choose to provide:</blockquote>

				<blockquote>
				<blockquote><strong>(i) Registration Information.</strong> When you register at the Website, you will be required to provide certain Personal Information;</blockquote>

				<blockquote><strong>(ii) Third Party Information.</strong> When you register at a third party website, and provide Personal Information to such third parties, LifeLock may (pursuant to agreements between LifeLock and those third parties) obtain such information to populate LifeLock registration forms for use when you hyperlink to the Website; and</blockquote>

				<blockquote><strong>(iii) Email Information.</strong> When you send LifeLock email messages or call LifeLock by telephone, LifeLock may retain the content of your email or telephone messages, together with your email address and LifeLock's response to you.</blockquote>
				</blockquote>

				<blockquote><strong>C. Cookies.</strong> Cookies are small text files that are stored by a user’s web browser on the hard drive of a user's computer. Cookies can "remember" what information ("Cookie Information") a user accesses on a particular web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that website by the same user, or can use that information to streamline the user’s transactions on related websites. The Cookies LifeLock uses on the Website may be "session" Cookies that are erased when you leave the Website, or may be "persistent" Cookies that remain on your computer's hard drive after you leave the Website. LifeLock also uses a Cookie installed by Google, Inc. to provide LifeLock with usage information regarding the Website. The Cookies LifeLock uses do not capture your Personal Information. LifeLock may also set Cookies when you register at the Website, and may do so without notice to or permission from you or any third party. Third party websites which are accessible from the Website via links, banner ads, or "click-throughs" may also use Cookies, and LifeLock shall have no responsibility whatsoever for such Cookies.</blockquote>

				<blockquote><strong>D. Hyperlinks.</strong> The Website contains links to other websites, including those to one (1) or more third party referral websites. This Policy applies only to General Information, Personal Information and Cookie Information, and does not apply to information collected at such other websites. LifeLock is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites, and you understand and agree that those privacy practices may be significantly different than those stated in this Policy. LifeLock encourages you to learn about the privacy practices of those other websites and their operators.</blockquote>
				</blockquote>

				<blockquote><strong>2. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION.</strong> LifeLock uses and discloses your information as follows:</blockquote>

				<blockquote><strong>A. General Information.</strong> LifeLock uses and discloses General Information to understand Website demographics and content preferences, and may do so without notice to, or permission from, you or any third party. In particular, LifeLock may provide General Information about LifeLock customers, sales, Website traffic patterns and related information to LifeLock affiliates or third parties;</blockquote>

				<blockquote><strong>B. Personal Information.</strong> LifeLock shall protect your Personal Information from disclosure to third parties using a reasonable degree of care, and does not otherwise use or disclose your Personal Information except as follows:</blockquote>

				<blockquote><strong>(ii)</strong> LifeLock may disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of developing, and providing to you information regarding, products and services that LifeLock believes will be of interest to you, but LifeLock shall not share, sell, rent or trade your Personal Information with third parties to promote the businesses of such third parties;</blockquote>

				<blockquote><strong>(vii)</strong> LifeLock may use and disclose your Personal Information to notify you about changes to the Website or LifeLock business, or new LifeLock services and special offers you may find valuable;</blockquote>

				<blockquote><strong>(viii)</strong> LifeLock may transfer your Personal Information to third parties for those parties to use to populate their own website registration forms when you hyperlink from the Website to their websites, in order to save you time in filling out their registration forms. Such third party websites may include websites that are owned by third parties or that are "co-branded" sites of LifeLock; and</blockquote>

				<blockquote><strong>(xi)</strong> Any Personal Information you provide may also be collected by LifeLock's merchandise and service suppliers in order to process, bill and fulfill your orders.</blockquote>

				</blockquote>

				<blockquote><strong>C. Cookie Information.</strong> LifeLock uses and discloses Cookie Information to improve the Website and better serve you and other customers.

If you have any questions about security of your Personal Information or the security on the Website, you can send LifeLock an email at <a href="mailto:member.services@lifelock.com">member.services@lifelock.com</a>. You understand and agree that perfect security does not exist anywhere, and you will therefore protect your Personal Information in a reasonable way at all times. Accordingly, you will not recklessly disclose or publish your Social Security number or any other Personal Information to those that would reasonably be expected to improperly use or disclose that Personal Information such as by way of example in response to "phishing" scams, unsolicited emails or pop-up messages seeking disclosure of Personal Information.</blockquote>

				<blockquote><strong>4.
