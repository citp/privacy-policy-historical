					<p>Welcome to LifeLock. Keeping your non-public personal information secure and confidential is our top priority. This LifeLock Privacy Policy describes our information practices. Please take a moment to read this LifeLock Privacy Policy carefully to learn how we handle your personal information.</p>

<p>This policy may change from time to time. By accessing our web site, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. Each time you use our web site, the current version of the Privacy Policy will apply. Accordingly, you should check this Privacy Policy when you visit our web site.</p>

<p>We take reasonable steps to (i) give you, a member of LifeLock or a user of our web site, clear notice when we are requesting or collecting information from you, and (ii) advise you of the types of information we collect about you, the general purposes for which that information will be used or disclosed, and the categories of users to whom we provide the information. Furthermore, we take reasonable steps to maintain accurate records, provide you with access to your personally identifiable information, and to safeguard the non-public personal information we collect about you through physical and electronic systems.</p>

<h2>How we collect non-public personal information</h2>

<p>While enrolling for services on our site, we will ask you for the following types of information: contact information (such as name, address, phone number, and email address); sensitive information (such as social security number); personal information to verify your identity, and financial information (such as credit card number). This information is required in order to verify your identity, charge you the agreed fees for our services, and to fulfill our obligation to provide services to you, including communicating with third parties as necessary to provide those services, such as identification verification companies, consumer reporting agencies, payment validation companies or law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>We also receive information from you when you send us email, applications and other forms, when you enroll for our services, or when you call us. We may also collect information about your transactions with us, such as what products and services you ordered, as well as your transactions with any third parties with whom we put you in communication. In each of these circumstances, we will collect information only with your full knowledge and consent. We do not share your non-public personal information with third parties, except third parties that are performing services for us. We require these third party service providers to agree to use your non-public personal information only for the purpose of performing those services with or for us.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>For visitors or members using our web site, we use cookies on our web site. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We link the information we store in cookies to personally identifiable information you submit while on our web site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.</p>

<p>We also use a third party cookie from Google.com, which provides us with usage information regarding our site. That cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable information you submit on our site.</p>

<p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our web site, but your ability to use some areas of our web site, such as the signup procedure or login, will be limited.</p>

<h2>Aggregate Data</h2>

<p>With respect to users and members using our web site, LifeLock also collects general Internet data, such as how often each of our web pages was visited and how much time was spent on each page. None of this information identifies you personally. We use it only to analyze traffic patterns on our web site in order to make our site more useful to our visitors and to evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. We use log files on our webserver as well as third-party and internally developed Customer Relationship Management (CRM) technology to capture and analyze this data.</p>

<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

<p>The LifeLock web site contains links to other sites. LifeLock does not share your non-public personal information with those web sites and is not responsible for their privacy practices, which may differ from ours in significant ways. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those web sites and the companies that operate them. In addition, web sites to which we link may use cookie technology to gather and store data about their visitors.</p>

<h2>Why we collect non-public personal information</h2>

<p>As a member of LifeLock or as a user of our web site, we want you to know that we collect your non-public personal information for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>To enroll you as a member or complete a transaction</li>

<li>To request placement of a fraud alert on your consumer report</li>

<li>To perform or complete other LifeLock services for you, or to contact you about other LifeLock services from time to time</li>
</ul>

<h2>When and to whom we disclose non-public personal information</h2>

<p>We may disclose non-public personal information about you directly to third parties on your behalf in order to process or perform our services for you. For example, we may order reports about you directly from consumer reporting agencies or others in accordance with the agreement between us for services. For example, we may provide information to:</p>

<ul>
<li>a consumer reporting agency representative, in the course of placing a fraud alert</li>

<li>a police officer, in the course of filing a police report</li>

<li>an insurance claims officer, in the course of filing an insurance claim</li>

<li>a representative of a financial institution or credit card company</li>

<li>service providers as described below</li>
</ul>

<h2>Service Providers</h2>

<p>We may also disclose non-public personal information about you to third parties to assist us in providing our services to you. For example, we use a payment verification company to provide credit card validation for us. When you enroll for our services, we will share your information with these third party services providers as necessary to provide our services to you. We prohibit these third parties by contract from using your personally identifiable information for any purpose other than to complete the delivery and performance of our services.</p>

<h2>Other Disclosures and Disclosures Required by Law</h2>

<p>If you have enrolled for our Service jointly with another individual in your household, we may disclose your personally identifiable information to any person jointly enrolled on your account. We reserve the right to use or disclose personal information we collect about you (i) in order to investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; (ii) in connection with the sale, purchase, merger, or reorganization of LifeLock; or (iii) when we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of LifeLock or other persons. Further, at times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information. We will comply with any such law or legal process.</p>

<h2>How we protect your non-public personal information</h2>

<p>LifeLock uses strict physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the confidentiality and security of the non-public personal information you provide to us.</p>

<ul>
<li>We do not disclose your non-public personal information except as described in this privacy statement.</li>

<li>We limit access to your non-public personal information to those individuals who "need to know" in order to perform a business purpose related to our Service.</li>

<li>We encrypt non-public personal information stored electronically.</li>

<li>Any data we transmit over a private network will be sent via secure, encrypted channels.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>

<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. IN NO EVENT WILL LIFELOCK OR ITS AFFILIATES OR ANY PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING OR DELIVERING OUR SERVICES OR OUR WEB SITE BE LIABLE IN ANY MANNER WHATSOEVER FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF YOUR ACCESS, USE OR INABILITY TO USE OUR SERVICES OR OUR WEB SITE, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY FAILURE OR PERFORMANCE, ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DEFECT, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION OF OUR SERVICES OR OUR WEB SITE, COMPUTER VIRUS OR LINE OR SYSTEM FAILURE (INCLUDING DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM INACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION OR INCONVENIENCE, DELAY, OR LOSS OF THE USE OF THE WEB SITE). THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS APPLY WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF LIFELOCK OR ITS AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about security of your non-public personal information or the security on our web site, you can email us at member.services@lifelock.com. Likewise, we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data, both on and off the Internet.</p>

<h2>Opt Out from Further Marketing from LifeLock</h2>

<p>If you enroll for our products or services but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, we provide you with an opportunity to indicate your preference on our order form. Even if you elect not to receive communications about our other products or services, we may still contact you about the services for which you have enrolled with us.</p>

<p>If you subscribe to our newsletter or consent to our promotional communications and then decide that you no longer wish to receive them, you may notify us of your preference regarding future communications by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication, or by emailing us at member.services@lifelock.com, contacting us at 1-800-LifeLock(543-3562), or by regular mail at:</p>

It may be removed at any time at the request of the member. Should you choose to disclose personal information on our site, we are not responsible for the way third parties may use this information. Third parties may use your personal information for a variety of purposes, including unsolicited marketing and sales attempts.</p>
