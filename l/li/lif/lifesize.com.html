Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle your personal information.</p>
			<p><b class="dkgrey">Why we collect personal information</b><br>LifeSize collects and uses your personal information to give you superior customer service. In addition, we use your personal information to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers, and other information we think you'd like to hear about.

			<p>LifeSize works with other companies that help us provide a family of LifeSize products and services to you, and we may provide your personal information to these companies.

The information they receive is for shipping and delivery purposes only, and we require the companies to execute an agreement to safeguard your personal information in accordance with our policies.</p>
			<p>At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that disclosure is necessary for the public interest.</p>
