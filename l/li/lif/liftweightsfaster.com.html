Winning a prize is contingent upon being compliant with these Official Rules and fulfilling all other requirements set forth herein and/or required by applicable law.</p>
<p>4. Contest Period</p>
<p>The Contest begins on 2015-12-01 00:00:00 and ends on 2015-12-07 10:00:00 (the “Contest Period”). Entries that are submitted before or after the Contest Period will be disqualified. Submissions will be accepted for the duration of the Contest Period.</p>
<p>5. How to Enter</p>

<p>Online: You may enter by visiting our website at the following hyperlink: http://www.unapologeticallypowerful.com/, and following the directions provided to fill out and submit the required entry information. By entering the Contest online, you understand that you will be automatically subscribed to our mailing list, and may receive communications from us from time to time in the future, and you expressly consent to agree to such subscription and communications.</p>

<p>6.Prize Drawing; Odds of WInning</p>
<p>On or about 2015-12-07 19:00:00, the Sponsor will select the potential winners in a random drawing, without replacement, from among all eligible entries received. The odds of being selected depend on the total number of eligible entries.</p>
<p>7.Winner Notification</p>
<p>The potential winners will be notified by email. The Sponsor will attempt to notify each potential winner via email on or about 2014-03-17 19:00:00. If any potential winner cannot be contacted within five (5) business days after the date of the first attempt to contact him/her, or is disqualified for any reason, the Sponsor may select an alternate potential winner in his/her place at random from the remaining non-winning, eligible entries. Each winner will be required to complete, electronically sign and submit a Declaration of Compliance, in form as provided by Sponsor, within five (5) business days of the date notice or attempted notice is first sent, in order to claim his/her prize. If a potential winner cannot be contacted, or fails toe submit the Declaration of Compliance within the required time period, that potential winner forfeits the prize. If the potential winner is at least 18 but still considered a minor in his/her jurisdiction of residence, Sponsor reserves the right to award the prize in the name of his/her parent or legal guardian, who will be required to sign the Declaration of Compliance on the potential winner’s behalf and fulfill any other requirements imposed on the winner as set forth herein. Potential winners must continue to comply with all terms and conditions of these Official Rules and with applicable law, and winning is contingent upon fulfilling all such requirements. Sponsor will take reasonable steps to ensure that all prizes are fulfilled within approximately thirty (30) calendar days after the conclusion of the Contest (the “Award Period”).</p>

The Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any individual it finds to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Contest or to be acting in violation of these Official Rules or in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner. This reserved right is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to Sponsor either in equity or at law.
