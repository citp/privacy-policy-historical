# Privacy Policy - LifeStyle Channel

Here at The LifeStyle Channel group (‘TLC’) we understand the importance of keeping your personal information secure and private.

This website ('site') is owned and operated by FOXTEL Management Pty Ltd (trading as 'Foxtel'), ABN 65 068 671 938. This Privacy Policy applies to the collection, storage, use and dissemination by TLC of your personal information ('Your Personal Information'). TLC will review this Privacy Statement periodically and reserves the right, at its discretion, to modify or remove portions of this statement at any time. You should review this page periodically so that you are updated on any changes.

TLC recognises that your privacy is very important to you. For this reason, if we can (and you want to), you do not have to identify yourself when you use or access most of the features of the Site.

For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, Personal Information means information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database), whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or opinion.

On this site you may find links to other websites not operated by us. This Privacy Statement will not apply to those websites because we have no control over them. Always check the Privacy Policy of any other website you enter.

As part of TLC's commitment to the protection of Your Personal Information we have developed this policy in line with the National Privacy Principles (NPPs) developed by the Australian Federal Privacy Commissioner (now the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)) which represent industry best practice.
