## 1\. What kinds of personal information do we collect and how?

When you apply for a Foxtel Service** we collect personal information about you, and (where relevant) authorised representatives on your account. If you are an authorised representative on someone else's account, we may also collect information direct from you, for example if you provide your credit card information for use on an account. This enables us to connect you to your Foxtel Service, and allows us to provide and administer that service. This information may include your name, date of birth, contact details, credit card or bank account information, drivers licence number, Foxtel personal identification numbers (PINs) and other information relevant to the provision of your Foxtel Service.

We may also collect your personal information from you when you use a Foxtel Service, enter into one of our competitions or otherwise interact with us (such as through a Foxtel website, a Foxtel application or through social media). This may include information such as preference information and viewing habits and other usage data.

We may also collect your personal information from third parties where you have agreed with them that your information may be disclosed.

## 2\. What information do we collect when you use a Foxtel website or a Foxtel Service?

We collect information regarding activity on Foxtel websites and certain third party websites, such as the number of visitors to the website, the date and time of those visits, the number of pages viewed, navigation patterns and, where relevant, websites visited before visiting that website. On these websites, your visits are associated with cookies and/or local storage data which are unique identifiers that we use to store information about your current and previous visits. This information is collected by Foxtel or on Foxtel's behalf by various analytics companies. More information about how we use cookies, what information is collected and which third party sites we collect information from is available on the Foxtel Privacy Page which is located at <http://www.foxtel.com.au/about/privacy.html>.

When you use a Foxtel Service we collect information about your usage such as data and call usage, viewing or browsing habits as well as how you locate and watch content. This may include information on your favourite shows and channels.

If you are a Foxtel customer, we may link information about your viewing habits, website activity or usage with your account information.

This information provides Foxtel with statistics that we can use to analyse and improve our websites and our products and services. We may also use browsing and viewing habits data to deliver targeted marketing, advertising and content from Foxtel and third parties on Foxtel websites and Foxtel Services, as well as Foxtel advertising on third party sites, in each case relating to your preferences or interests.

For more information on how you can request not to receive targeted marketing and content based on your browsing or viewing habits please go to the Foxtel Privacy Page, which is located at <http://www.foxtel.com.au/about/privacy.html>.

We take all reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we hold is protected from misuse, interference and loss, and unauthorised access, modification or disclosure by the use of various methods, including secure storage.
