# PRIVACY POLICY | Lifestyle Mirror

The Company is committed to protecting your personal privacy. We provide this notice (the "Privacy Policy") to explain the type of information we collect on this Website and how that information is used.

When visiting this Website, you may be asked questions the answers to which are collected on an aggregate basis (i.e., the answers will not be stored in a manner that identifies them with you personally) and these questions will be identified as such on this Website. In all other instances, you should assume that we will track any information you provide on a personally identifiable basis.

When you register with this Website, you can elect to receive information and updates on our products and services and those of our subsidiaries, affiliates, and parent companies and any of their related businesses. Information will not be used for this purpose unless you request to receive such material.

Registration may be required to be eligible to enter online contests or sweepstakes. The Company may use the information you provide when registering to fulfill prizes, which may include disclosure to third party entities that assist with such fulfillment, and for other marketing and promotional purposes related to the contests or sweepstakes as disclosed on the rules applicable to a particular contest or sweepstakes.

We use return email addresses to answer the email that we receive, and we may use return email to send you other information. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose.

In addition to information that you provide us voluntarily, the Company may collect aggregate information in the form of IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from this Website, our servers log your IP address and certain other information, such as browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, data/time stamp, and clickstream data. We do not link this automatically-collected data to anything personally identifiable, so although your session will be logged, the automatically-collected data will not reveal to us any personally identifiable information about you.

Cookies are files or pieces of information that may be stored in your computer's hard drive when you visit a website. Cookies may also be used to help speed up your future activities or to improve your user experience by remembering the information that you have already provided to us. We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not voluntarily provided by you. The use of cookies is an industry standard. Some of our business partners also use cookies to provide us with anonymous data and information regarding the use of our Website. At your option, you may block cookies or delete cookies from your hard drive. However, by disabling cookies, you may not have access to the entire set of features of this Website.

We may use information collected from you in the following ways:

  * We may use information for internal marketing analysis, for example, to assess trends amongst our consumers or to measure the amount of traffic to our websites. We may also share non-personal information with others, such as advertisers, in aggregate anonymous form, which means that the information will not contain any personally identifiable information about you.
  * We may use your personal information in order to respond to your queries and requests and to manage transactions such as credit card payments for any goods that you order from us or any of our agents, or for the fulfillment of such transactions (e.g., delivery). The personal information you provide may be used by an authorized vendor to fulfill that order. We may also use your personal information in order to communicate with you about our products and services and those of our subsidiaries, affiliates, and parent companies and any of their related businesses.
  * We may arrange for selected organizations to send you marketing and promotional information that may be of interest to you. In such circumstances your personal information may be disclosed to these organizations who will agree to be bound by the terms of this privacy statement.
