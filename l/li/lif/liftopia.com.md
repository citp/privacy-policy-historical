#### What information we collect from you

In order to make a purchase and use certain services on this Site, you must first register for an account to log in to our network ("Account"). When you register with Liftopia, we ask for Personally Identifiable Information, including your first and last name, e-mail address and password. We retain information on your behalf, such as itineraries or other files that you store using your Account.

When you place an order for lift tickets, rentals, lessons or other products, we request certain Personally Identifiable Information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as first and last name, e-mail, and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date and security code). We use this information for billing purposes and to complete the transaction. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.

For all Liftopia visitors -- not just registered users – our servers collect Personally Identifiable Information, such as IP addresses, browser type, domain names, operating system, access times, duration of visit, referring URL, platform, new/repeat information, timestamp and exit page information. We gather this information to analyze trends and performances over time to make our Site and services more useful to you and. Liftopia uses third-party service providers to help us gather and analyze information about our customers. These service providers are contractually restricted from using your information in any manner other than in helping us to provide you with the products and services available on our Site.

We may receive Personally Identifiable Information, as well as "Anonymous Information" (information that is not associated with your Personally Identifiable Information and does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons) about you from companies that provide our services by way of a co-branded or private-labeled website or companies that offer their products and/or services on our Site. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Site in order to improve the services we provide.

We may also collect Personally Identifiable Information at other points in our Site that state that Personally Identifiable Information is being collected.

#### How your information is used

The data we gather is used to process your purchase, respond to your requests, contact you if problems arise and, if you have selected to receive them, send you promotional messages. The information we collect helps us to better serve you.

Liftopia uses the information to facilitate the creation of and secure your Account on our network; identify you as a user in our system; provide improved administration of our Site and services; and send you administrative e-mail notifications, such as security or support and maintenance advisories.

Liftopia uses the information that we gather to target content on our Site to more closely match your interests and, if you have selected to receive e-mail communication from us, to target e-mail marketing messages that are more appropriate to your needs.

We may create Anonymous Information from Personally Identifiable Information by excluding information (such as your name) that make the data personally identifiable to you. We use this Anonymous Information to analyze request patterns so that we may enhance the content of our services and improve Site navigation. Liftopia reserves the right to use Anonymous Information for any purpose and disclose Anonymous Information to third parties in its sole discretion.

#### How your information is protected

Liftopia maintains data handling and storage practices and procedures that are designed to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of customer information. The security of your Personally Identifiable Information is important to us. When you enter Personally Identifiable Information (such as your credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also require you to enter a password to access your Account. Please do not disclose your Account password to unauthorized people. Current Internet security methods and technologies are used to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy and ensure correct use of information.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personally Identifiable Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our Site, you can send email to us at info@liftopia.com.

#### With whom your information may be shared

When you make a purchase with Liftopia, the Personally Identifiable Information you provide will be shared with the third parties necessary to complete your purchase transaction. For example, we provide your name, address, and phone number to the resort for which you purchased your lift tickets. To charge you for your transaction, we share your name, billing address, and credit card number with the credit card authorization company. Liftopia may also share your Personally Identifiable Information with third party service providers to conduct quality assurance testing, to facilitate the creation of accounts, to provide technical support and to provide other services to Liftopia. These third parties are required not to use your Personally Identifiable Information other than to provide the services requested by Liftopia.

We may enter into agreements with companies that provide our products or services by way of a co-branded or private-labeled website or companies that offer their products and/or services on our Site ("Third Party Companies"). A Third Party Company may want access to Personally Identifiable Information that we collect from its customers. As a result, we may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to a Third Party Company; however, we will not disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to Third Party Companies for the Third Party Companies’ own direct marketing purposes, unless you have "opted-in" by following the instructions we provide to allow such disclosure. If you have opted-in to receive e-mail communications from a Third Party Company and later wish to discontinue receipt of these e-mails, please contact the Third Party Company directly to update your preferences. The privacy policies of our Third Party Companies may apply to the use and disclosure of your Personally Identifiable Information that we collect and disclose to such Third Party Companies. Because we do not control the privacy practices of our Third Party Companies, you should read and understand their privacy policies.

From time to time, we may share Anonymous Information, including general statistical information about our Site and visitors -- such as number of visitors, aggregate and non-personally identifiable demographic data, number and type of goods and services booked, etc. -- with our third-party advertisers and partners. However, we do not reveal your name, address or other Personally Identifiable Information for anything other than the use it was originally intended without giving you the opportunity to opt-out of the disclosure.

Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personally Identifiable Information (as described below), Liftopia may disclose information about you to others if we have a good faith belief that we are required to do so by law or legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Liftopia or others. This includes, but is not limited to, customer fraud, technical malfunctions or abuse of our network or systems. We also may provide customer information to third parties, such as credit card companies, for the purpose of resolving disputes that arise in the normal course of business. Except as otherwise stated above, Liftopia will not disclose your Personally Identifiable Information with any third party without your consent.

This Privacy Statement applies only to information collected by this Site.
