When you register on the Web Site, or make a purchase transaction on the Web Site or through a LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL ticketing or merchandising partner, your personal information will not be sold, shared, rented or distributed to others, including sponsors, affiliates, and partners (the “Affiliated Parties”). However, there may be some other, limited circumstances in which LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL may be required to share or transfer Personal Information in our databases, for example, to comply with a legal requirement, for the administration of justice, to protect your vital interests, or in the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution, or similar event. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL restricts access to nonpublic Personal Information to those employees and agents who need such information.

LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL may engage third-parties to perform functions on its behalf, including: sending of newsletters, postal mail, and email; analyzing and processing data; payment processing; and providing customer service. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL requires that these parties agree to use Personal Information in compliance with this privacy policy, and in accordance with any other appropriate confidentiality and security procedures. These parties may have access to Customer Information needed to perform their functions, but LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL will not authorize them to use it for purposes that do not conform to this privacy policy.

#### 5\. ANONYMOUS DATA COLLECTED

In addition to the information you provide when you use [www.lifeisbeautiful.com](http://www.lifeisbeautiful.com/), LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL uses technology to collect anonymous information about the use of our Web Site. For example, we use technology to track how many visitors access our Web Site, the date and time of their visit, the length of their stay, and which pages they view. We also use technology to determine which web browsers our visitors use and the address from which they accessed our sites (for example, if they connected to the Web Site by clicking on a banner ad).

This technology does not identify you personally. It simply enables us to compile statistics about our visitors and their use of the Web Site. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL and our Affiliates use this anonymous data and share it with third-parties to improve the content and functionality of our Web Site, to better understand our customers and markets, and to improve our products and services.

#### 6\. COOKIES

A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies do not damage your computer, and they cannot be used to discover the identity of a user. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. This enables you to decide if you want to accept it or not, and whether you are required to accept the cookie to view certain content. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL may use cookies to “persist” a user session — that is, to maintain connection with a user as he or she moves through an application or series of web pages.

If you receive communications from us that you do not want to receive, you may opt out of receiving those communications by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email or emailing us at info@lifeisbeautiful.com. Occasionally it is necessary to send out a service-related announcement. Generally, users may not opt out of these communications. These communications are not promotional in nature.

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or concerns about the way LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL processes your personal data, please contact us at [info@lifeisbeautiful.com](mailto:info@lifeisbeautiful.com).

You and Life is Beautiful, LLC agree that we will resolve any disputes between us through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings. All controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and Life is Beautiful, LLC relating to the Site, Contest Rules, and Terms of Use (each a “Claim”) shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA Rules”). The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs, documents, or other evidence submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies.

If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Life is Beautiful, LLC will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator’s fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.

This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and Life is Beautiful, LLC also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In addition, you and Life is Beautiful, LLC retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with these Terms of Use, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided herein.

Neither you nor Life is Beautiful, LLC may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim. Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only your and/or Life is Beautiful, LLC’s individual Claims. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. This Section will survive the termination of your relationship with Life is Beautiful, LLC.

THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, LLC WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
