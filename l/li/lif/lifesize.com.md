Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn about how we handle your personal information, and contact us at privacy@lifesize.com with any questions or concerns.

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN**

This Privacy Policy is organized in multiple sections in order to make it easier to review and understand.

Please note that Section 3 applies only to information collected through Lifesize’s Website, and Section 4 applies only to information collected through Lifesize’s Services.

The remaining sections apply to all information collected by Lifesize, whether through the Website, the Services or another source.

**_If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use this Website or the Services._**

**SECTION 1: SCOPE**

This Privacy Policy applies to information collected through www.lifesize.com and other websites maintained by Lifesize (the “Website”), as well as through the use of Lifesize’s products and services, including the Lifesize cloud-based video conferencing and collaboration services accessible through web, mobile and desktop applications, Device Software Subscriptions, support services, professional services, and any applicable software, features or functionalities of such services (collectively, the “Services”).

This Privacy Policy does not apply to your use of unaffiliated websites, services or products, nor does it apply to third parties that Lifesize does not own or control, or individuals that Lifesize does not employ or manage. For example, it does not apply to any third party websites to which Lifesize’s Website may link, or to third party distributors or resellers that support, market or sell Lifesize products and Services. Lifesize encourages you to carefully read the privacy statement of any website you visit.

**SECTION 2: HOW LIFESIZE COLLECTS INFORMATION**

  * Through the Services: Lifesize collects information through the Services as described in Section 4 of this Privacy Policy below.
  * Offline: Lifesize may collect information from you offline, such as when you attend a trade show or Lifesize event, or during a phone call or in-person meeting with a Lifesize sales representative or other employee.
  * From Other Sources: Lifesize may obtain information about you from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, social media platforms, distributors, resellers, or other third parties.



**SECTION 3: PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THE WEBSITE**

**Types of Personal Information Collected through the Website**

Personal information collected through the Website includes information that reasonably can be used to identify or describe you as an individual, such as: name, employer, business role, professional title, contact information (company, email address, telephone number, and physical business address), localization data, IP address, domain name, and demographic information.

**Why We Collect Personal Information through the Website**

Lifesize collects personal information that you voluntarily provide when you visit the Website in order to communicate with you about our Services, enter into transactions with Customers, and to ensure you have a positive experience when visiting the Website and using the Services. In addition, we use your personal information to keep you up-to-date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers, and other information we think you would like to hear about. This may occasionally include information from other companies about products and services that can add value to your Lifesize products. From time to time, we may also use your personal information to contact you online, through the mail or via telephone to participate in a market research survey so that we can gauge customer satisfaction and improve our products and services.

**Submission of Personal Information**

You may provide personal information through the Website when you access product information and updates, register for a seminar, subscribe to our newsletter, download a report or other materials, register for a free trial or demonstration equipment, place an order for products or Services, access a portal for technical service or support, or sign into a page that requires authorization. In addition, we may ask you from time to time to participate in a survey. You will know which personal information you submit in each case because you will manually enter the information. If you choose not to register and provide information, you can still use most of the Website. Unfortunately, you will not be able to access areas that require registration.

**Social Media Features**

The Website includes social network media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and widgets, including the Share button. These social media features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Website, and may set a cookie to enable such feature to function properly. The social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Website, and they allow you the ability to post information about your activities on the Website to your profile page to share with others within your social network. Your interactions with these social media features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing it.

**On-line Purchases**

Any payment information, including credit card information, that you submit through the Website is collected by our payment processor and not collected by Lifesize.

If you use this Website to apply for employment with Lifesize, we will use the personal information you provide to process your application and to monitor recruitment statistics. Unless otherwise required by law, we will not disclose your personal information to a third party (for example, in connection with verifying professional references) without informing you. We may retain personal information about unsuccessful candidates after the recruitment exercise has been completed. We may also retain de-personalized statistical information about applicants to help our recruitment activities. Employee information and recruitment data is retained at Lifesize’s corporate headquarters in Austin, Texas, and in other Lifesize locations worldwide.
