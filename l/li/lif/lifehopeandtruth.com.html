<h3>8. How we Protect Personal Information</h3>

<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We protect your personal information by maintaining physical, organizational and technological safeguards intended to help protect against unauthorized use, disclosure or access.

In such cases, as appropriate, we will provide you with a reasonable explanation of why it is not possible to grant access to your personal information.</p>

<h3>10. Changes to our Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. You will see the word “updated” followed by the date next to the Privacy Policy link near the bottom of all pages on the site. If the “updated” date has changed since you last visited, you are encouraged to review the policy to be informed of how this site is protecting your information.</p>
