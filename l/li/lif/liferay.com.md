Some features on the Liferay website are available to users only upon registration. Liferay uses Personal Information in order to allow individuals to access the Liferay community resources such as forums, wiki and the issue tracker.

Liferay also uses identifying information to track web site activity and asset downloads, as well as to target promotional emails based on the provided preferences and to associate forum comments, blog posts and wiki contributions to the specific user.

We will always tell you before we collect any Personal Information and will only use your Personal Information in the way specified when it was collected. Subsequently, we will not change the way your Personal Information is used without your consent.

You may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or you can contact us at (legal@liferay.com).

##  Collection of non-personal/anonymous information

In using our products or services, anonymous network information may be transmitted back to us to determine how users are interacting with our products, assist us with improving our products, and provide alerts regarding available software updates/upgrades. In some instances, Liferay may collect non-personal (aggregate or demographic) data through cookies, web logs, and web beacons. That information is used to improve the usability, performance, and effectiveness of the website. Please read the "Cookies" section below for more information.

##  Sharing your Personal Information

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.

We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

We will not share, sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties. We may otherwise disclose your Personal Information when 1) we have your express consent to share the information for a specified purpose; 2) we need to respond to subpoenas, court orders or other such legal process; or 3) we need to protect the personal safety of the users of our websites or exercise or defend the legal rights and property of Liferay regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, violations of Liferay's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. We may also transfer your Personal Information to Liferay U.S., to any Liferay subsidiary worldwide, or to third parties acting on our behalf for the purposes of processing or storage.

##  Facebook Connect and Open ID

You can log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.

##  Security of your Personal Information

For our users' security, Liferay utilizes a combination of industry-standard security technologies, procedures, and organizational measures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Liferay was benchmarked as among the most secure portal platforms using LogicLibrary's Logiscan suite. Personal Information data is stored in the Liferay Portal, which uses industry standard, government grade encryption technologies including advanced algorithims such as DES, MD5 and RSA. Entry into our datacenter is restricted by multiple levels of access control, including biometric palm scanners, and key card readers that limit movement within the facility to authorized areas. We authorize access to Personal Information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we recommend you to take every precaution in protecting your Personal Information when you are on the Internet.

##  Cookies

A cookie is a small, encrypted data string that a website stores on a visitor's computer which the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. A cookie cannot read personal data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites; the only Personal Information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Like many websites, Liferay's website may use both session ID cookies (which expire when you close the browser) and persistent cookies (which remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time) to help Liferay identify and track visitors, their usage of the Liferay website, and their website access preferences, and to deliver content specific to a visitor's interests. Liferay does not correlate cookies information with data about individual users. However, if you prefer not to receive cookies, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use any area of the Liferay website.

##  Third Party Cookies

The use of cookies by our service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site, in order for you to use the shopping cart and to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this Web Site.

##  Web beacons

Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.

##  Data retention

Liferay will not retain your Personal Information longer than is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by applicable laws or regulations.

##  Liferay Community

If you participate or contribute to Liferay's forums, wikis, documentation-related pages, and other pages within the Liferay site ("Community"), the information you provide there will be made broadly available to others, potentially inside or outside Liferay, who have access to the Community. Also, please recognize that certain forums may have additional rules and conditions. Each participant's opinion within a forum or chat room is his or her own and does not reflect the opinion of Liferay. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at legal@liferay.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

##  Linked websites

Our websites may provide links to other third-party websites that are outside our control and not covered by this policy. For example we use SourceForge.net for the download of our products and we also provide links to partners and clients on our website. We cannot extend the warranties under this declaration on data protection to such sites. Nor does the fact that we refer to such sites mean that we adopt their contents as our own. We encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on those and all sites you visit.

##  Your California Privacy Rights

Residents of the State of California, under a new provision of the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an Opt-out or Opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.

If you are a California resident and want to request information on how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please send a request to legal@liferay.com.

##  COPPA Requirement

Liferay complies with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the FTC's Rule interpreting COPPA (16 CFR § 512).
