# Privacy - Liferay.com

Liferay, Inc. and its affiliated companies are committed to the privacy of the users of our website. This Privacy Policy was created to inform you of our personal information handling practices for the Liferay website. Any personal information provided to us will be treated according to this policy. Please note that when you submit information via the Liferay website, you are consenting to the collection, use and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and therefore, we encourage you to read this entire Privacy Policy before submitting any information and/or using the Liferay website. 

##  Collection and use of your Personal Information 

"Personal Information" shall mean any information that can be used to identify an individual, and may include, but not limited to, name, email address, postal or other physical address, title, occupation, and other information required to provide a service, deliver a product, or carry out a transaction you have requested. 

Some features on the Liferay website are available to users only upon registration. Liferay uses Personal Information in order to allow individuals to access the Liferay community resources such as forums, wiki and the issue tracker. 

Liferay also uses identifying information to track web site activity and asset downloads, as well as to target promotional emails based on the provided preferences and to associate forum comments, blog posts and wiki contributions to the specific user. 

We will always tell you before we collect any Personal Information and will only use your Personal Information in the way specified when it was collected. Subsequently, we will not change the way your Personal Information is used without your consent. 

##  Accessing and updating your Personal Information 

In order to ensure that your Personal Information is accurate and up to date, please notify us of any changes to your Personal Information. If you are a registered user, you may update your profile online via the "My Account" area accessed through the "Settings" link in the global navigation. 

##  Collection of non-personal/anonymous information 

In using our products or services, anonymous network information may be transmitted back to us to determine how users are interacting with our products, assist us with improving our products, and provide alerts regarding available software updates/upgrades. In some instances, Liferay may collect non-personal (aggregate or demographic) data through cookies, web logs, and web beacons. That information is used to improve the usability, performance, and effectiveness of the website. Please read the "Cookies" section below for more information. 

##  Sharing your Personal Information 

We will not sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties. We may otherwise disclose your Personal Information when 1) we have your express consent to share the information for a specified purpose; 2) we need to respond to subpoenas, court orders or other such legal process; or 3) we need to protect the personal safety of the users of our websites or exercise or defend the legal rights and property of Liferay regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, violations of Liferay's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. We may also transfer your Personal Information to Liferay U.S., to any Liferay subsidiary worldwide, or to third parties acting on our behalf for the purposes of processing or storage. 

##  Security of your Personal Information 

For our users' security, Liferay utilizes a combination of industry-standard security technologies, procedures, and organizational measures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Liferay was benchmarked as among the most secure portal platforms using LogicLibrary's Logiscan suite. Personal Information data is stored in the Liferay Portal, which uses industry standard, government grade encryption technologies including advanced algorithims such as DES, MD5 and RSA. Entry into our datacenter is restricted by multiple levels of access control, including biometric palm scanners, and key card readers that limit movement within the facility to authorized areas. We authorize access to Personal Information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we recommend you to take every precaution in protecting your Personal Information when you are on the Internet. 

##  Cookies 

A cookie is a small, encrypted data string that a website stores on a visitor's computer which the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. A cookie cannot read personal data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites; the only Personal Information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Like many websites, Liferay's website may use both session ID cookies (which expire when you close the browser) and persistent cookies (which remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time) to help Liferay identify and track visitors, their usage of the Liferay website, and their website access preferences, and to deliver content specific to a visitor's interests. Liferay does not correlate cookies information with data about individual users. However, if you prefer not to receive cookies, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use any area of the Liferay website. 

##  Data retention 

Liferay will not retain your Personal Information longer than is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by applicable laws or regulations. 

##  Liferay Community 

If you participate or contribute to Liferay's forums, wikis, documentation-related pages, and other pages within the Liferay site ("Community"), the information you provide there will be made broadly available to others, potentially inside or outside Liferay, who have access to the Community. Also, please recognize that certain forums may have additional rules and conditions. Each participant's opinion within a forum or chat room is his or her own and does not reflect the opinion of Liferay. 

##  Linked websites 

Our websites may provide links to other third-party websites that are outside our control and not covered by this policy. For example we use SourceForge.net for the download of our products and we also provide links to partners and clients on our website. We cannot extend the warranties under this declaration on data protection to such sites. Nor does the fact that we refer to such sites mean that we adopt their contents as our own. We encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on those and all sites you visit. 

##  Your California Privacy Rights 

Residents of the State of California, under a new provision of the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an Opt-out or Opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. 

If you are a California resident and want to request information on how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please send a request to [legal@liferay.com](mailto:legal@liferay.com). 

##  COPPA Requirement 

Liferay complies with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the FTC's Rule interpreting COPPA (16 CFR § 512). Our websites are not directed to children and we do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age through our sites. 

##  Questions or comments? 

Should you have any privacy-related questions or comments related to this Privacy Policy, please send an email to [legal@liferay.com](mailto:legal@liferay.com).
