<p><span style=" font-family:  trebuchet ms;">Welcome to Life's Little Mysteries!</span></p>
<p><span style=" font-family:  trebuchet ms;">Life's Little Mysteries has created this Privacy Policy  in order to set forth the principles governing our information-gathering  and dissemination practices. Life's Little Mysteries has a strong  commitment to the privacy of our users. Please note that this Privacy  Policy applies only to information collected through Life's Little  Mysteries and not to information collected offline or to information you  may provide to any third-party sites to which Life's Little Mysteries  may link, except as expressly provided herein.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: trebuchet ms;">Information We  Collect</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=" font-family:  trebuchet ms;">There are two kinds of information that Life's Little  Mysteries can obtain about you: "Anonymous Information" and "Personally  Identifiable Information."</span></p>
<p><span style=" font-family:  trebuchet ms;">"Anonymous Information" consists of  non-personally-identifiable data, such as your Internet Protocol ("IP")  address or domain, or information about your usage on Life's Little  Mysteries that is used for administrative purposes only. For example, an  IP address is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your  computer by your Internet Service Provider. Web servers automatically  identify your computer by its IP address. We may collect our users' IP  addresses for such purposes as to help diagnose problems with our  servers and to report aggregate information to our advertisers,  corporate affiliates and consultants, and to third parties that perform  particular services on our behalf.</span></p>
<p><span style=" font-family:  trebuchet ms;">We may also use the information linked to IP addresses to  ban users who violate our Terms and Conditions of use.</span></p>
<p><span style=" font-family:  trebuchet ms;">"Personally Identifiable Information" is any information  that personally identifies you, such as your name, street address, email  address, or telephone number. We collect such information when, for  example, you enter a contest, subscribe to our email newsletter, and  participate in other interactive online activities.</span></p>
<p><span style=" font-family:  trebuchet ms;">When we collect Personally Identifiable Information from  you, you will have the opportunity to "opt in" to receive email or other  digital communications from us and/or our business partners.</span></p>
<p><span style=" font-family:  trebuchet ms;">If you have submitted your personal information to Life's  Little Mysteries, you may correct, amend or delete the Personally  Identifiable Information maintained on file about you if it is  incorrect.</span></p>
<p><span style=" font-family:  trebuchet ms;">In all cases, we will only use your information as  permitted by law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Privacy  Policy, however, we may disclose Personally Identifiable Information to  others if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe  that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal  process; (b) protect and defend our rights and property; (c) protect  against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site; or (d) protect the  personal safety or property of our users or the public. Please note that  we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: trebuchet ms;">Use of  "Cookies"</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=" font-family:  trebuchet ms;">Life's Little Mysteries uses "cookies" - data that is  transferred from Life's Little Mysteries to your hard drive for  record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to deliver content specific to  your interests and to save your password so you do not have to re-enter  it each time you visit Life's Little Mysteries. Some of the  advertisements appearing on Life's Little Mysteries are delivered by our  third-party ad network, DoubleClick. In the course of serving  advertisements, DoubleClick may place or recognize a unique "cookie" in  your browser's cache, and may use Anonymous Information (including  date/time of the banner ad displayed, the ad that was displayed and the  IP address of the visitor) about your visits to this and other Web sites  in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest  to you and to collect statistical information. For more information  about DoubleClick's privacy policy, </span><a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx"><span style=" font-family: trebuchet  ms;">please click here</span></a><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms;">. If you would like to "opt  out" of having a unique cookie placed on your hard drive by DoubleClick, </span><a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx"><span style="font-family: trebuchet  ms;">please click here</span></a><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms;">.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: trebuchet ms;">Disclosure of  Information through Business Transfers</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=" font-family:  trebuchet ms;">As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge  or partner with other companies or businesses, and in so doing, acquire  customer information. In such transactions, user information may be  among the transferred assets. Similarly, in the event that a portion or  all of Life's Little Mysteries's assets are sold or transferred to a  third party, customer information (including your email address) would  likely be one of the transferred business assets.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: trebuchet ms;">Third Party  Web Sites</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=" font-family:  trebuchet ms;">Life's Little Mysteries contains links to third-party Web  sites not owned or controlled by Life's Little Mysteries. Life's Little  Mysteries is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content  of such third-party Web sites. Inclusion of any linked Web site on  Life's Little Mysteries does not imply or express an approval or  endorsement of the linked Web site by us, or of any of the content,  opinions, products or services provided on these Web sites. Even if an  affiliation exists between Life's Little Mysteries and a third-party Web  site, we exercise no control over linked sites. Each of these linked  sites maintains its own independent privacy and data collection policies  and procedures. If you visit a Web site via a link from one of our  Sites, we encourage you to consult that Web site's privacy policy before  providing any personal information, and whenever interacting with any  such Web site.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: trebuchet ms;">Security</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=" font-family:  trebuchet ms;">Life's Little Mysteries has reasonable security measures  in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information  under our control. Security of information communicated by or to us over  the Internet is of utmost concern to us; however, no data transmission  over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that  your email, like most, if not all, unencrypted Internet communications,  may potentially be accessed and viewed by other Internet users, without  your knowledge and permission, while in transit to us. For that reason,  to protect your privacy, please do not use email to communicate  information to us that you consider confidential. While we strive to  protect your personal information, Life's Little Mysteries cannot ensure  or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. Once we  receive your transmission, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure its  security on our internal systems. Depending on the nature of the  inquiry, your communication may be discarded or archived.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: trebuchet ms;">Policy  Regarding Minors</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=" font-family:  trebuchet ms;">Children should always ask parents before providing any  personal information online. No information should be submitted to or  posted on Life's Little Mysteries by any minor (a person under 18 years  of age) without the consent of a parent or guardian. Unless otherwise  disclosed during collection, we do not knowingly provide any Personally  Identifiable Information about minors, regardless of its source, nor is  this information knowingly used by Life's Little Mysteries for any  marketing or promotional purposes. Minors are not eligible to  participate in contests. </span></p>
<p><span style=" font-family:  trebuchet ms;">Life's Little Mysteries abides by the Children's Online  Privacy Protection Act. In the event that we learn that we have  collected information from any child under the age of 13 without  verification of parental consent, we will delete this information from  our database as quickly as reasonably possible. If you believe that any  Site has collected any information about anyone under 13, please contact  Life's Little Mysteries's Site Administrator via postal mail or email  at one of the addresses listed below.</span></p>
