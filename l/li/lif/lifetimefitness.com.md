**_Life Time Fitness Web Privacy Policy_**  
**Updated Feb 18, 2009** _Information about Life Time Fitness and Our Web Sites_  
Life Time Fitness, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("we or Life Time") have established this Web Privacy Policy to explain how we treat information we collect from you through [www.lifetimefitness.com](http://www.lifetimefitness.com/) and [www.mylt.com](http://www.mylt.com/), including any sub-domains. This Policy does not apply to personal information collected from you in other ways, including in Life Time centers. 

We reserve the right to change this Web Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we change this Policy, we will post a revised Policy on our Sites. If you continue to use the Sites thereafter, you hereby provide your consent to the revised Policy.

If you remove persistent cookies, you may still use our Sites. _Strategic Partners_  
We sometimes permit other companies to advertise on our Sites, such as our strategic business partners who offer discounts to Life Time members. Our strategic partners may use one or more of the technologies above to measure the effectiveness or personalize the content of their advertisements by tracking user interests. We do not control the use of these technologies, and they are not covered by this Web Privacy Policy. _Children_
