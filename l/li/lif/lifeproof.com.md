Privacy:  
This privacy policy applies to the use of LifeProof.com.

We value your privacy and make this policy easily accessible throughout our site to assist you in understanding the way information is handled in the course of using this site. Your privacy is very important to us. At LifeProof we want to make your online experience enjoyable and safe. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we want you to fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the attainment and use of that information.

INFORMATION LIFEPROOF COLLECTS AND TRACKS  
LifeProof collects two types of information about users:

Optional user provided information, e.g., voluntary submissions. Voluntary submissions include requests to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums, from participation in polls, surveys, warranty validation, and the like.

Additional information gathered through tracking and aggregation of information derived mainly by collating page views throughout our site. This information allows us to better contour our content to user needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience.

Usage Tracking:

LifeProof may collect user traffic usage characteristics throughout its website. However, we do not correlate this data with individual user information. LifeProof may analyze usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from data contained in the user's browser.

LifeProof may collect and catalog search terms that users employ in our Search function, but this tracking is not associated with individual users. We may use tracking information to determine the areas of our site most important to users based on the characteristics of usage of those areas. We will not track what any particular individual users read, but rather the performance of each page. This may help us to build a better web-based experience   for you.

Log Files and Cookies

This website utilizes industry standard analytics packages that gather limited information on visitors to our website automatically, and stores this anonymous information in server log files. This information may include IP addresses, browser type, basic IP information, referring pages, operating system used and date/time stamps. This information does not identify individual users; it is used only for site administration, as well as for analysis of website usage and trends.

Additionally, LifeProof may place a "cookie" in a user's browser files. Cookies are very small text files that are stored on personal computers for reference purposes. Such "cookies" do not contain personal information. Cookies do not read data off a user's hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. This information enables LifeProof to relate usage of our site to information that has been specifically and knowingly provided.

Specifically, cookies may be used to provide easier and faster access to website features such as logins and/or repeat visits. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you have submitted while on our site. In certain instances, LifeProof advertising systems may deliver a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates.

There are two types of cookies that LifeProof may employ. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when your browser is closed. A persistent cookie may stay on a user's hard drive for an extended period. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate our site. Persistent cookies can perform such activities as storing your password for forums or blogs so you do not have to sign in every time you visit those areas and/or may be used to enable us to track and target the interests of our users so as to enhance the overall experience of using our site.

Cookies may be prevented by turning them off in the user's browser. For instance, the user's browser may be set to give a warning before cookies are accepted, at which point a user may reject them. Cookies need not be turned on to use this site. However, cookies may need to be turned on to participate actively in our blog, polling and surveys.

Registration and Use of Personal Information

Registration is not required in order to use or access this website. However, registration is required for warranty validation purposes. Registration information will only be used for internal purposes and will not be provided to any third parties.

Accordingly, if you do fill out a survey, form, or testimonial on our site, and in the process provide us with personally identifiable information, rest assured that any such information you provide will not be shared with any third-party organization except with your express consent.

LifeProof may use information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience on our website, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users. Further, in time, we may use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters or to enable users to participate in polls and surveys. We are planning to send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and may occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. Rest assured LifeProof will never share newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or partners.

As indicated, LifeProof may track various information such as usage or traffic information. LifeProof may use such tracking information to determine the performance of aspects of our site as well as to determine the users likes and dislikes, with respect to a particular webpage, based on such traffic data.

For instance, LifeProof may create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns. LifeProof may also track search terms entered in a Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But LifeProof will not track which terms any particular user enters. Specifically, LifeProof does not track what any particular individual user reads and will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.

We also provide visitors to our website the opportunity to opt-in to receive communications from us. These communications may include a periodical newsletter, product promotions and any other information that we feel may be pertinent to the visitor. You may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications by emailing us at administration@lifeproof.com, by clicking on the 'unsubscribe' link in any email we send to you, by replying to any email we send you and entering the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject line.

If you provide us with your email address and/or name for the purposes of receiving communications from us, this information will not be shared with any third-party organization except with your express consent.

By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by LifeProof. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.

Access to Personally Identifiable Information

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer wish us to possess your information, you may request correction, updating, or deletion of your information by emailing us at administration@lifeproof.com.

Therefore - as is the case with any organization - we are not in a position to guarantee the absolute security of your information.

Nevertheless, the security of your personal and financial information is extremely important to us. We insure confidentiality and security in our online shopping experience. For instance, we employ various firewalls and other security tactics to keep your information secure. We do not store your complete credit card information on our internal web server. Once you place your order, the order is sent to our main order processing system using a private system. Once your order is completed it is entirely deleted from our web records. While there is risk inherent in every Internet transaction, be assured that we are work hard to ensure that risk is minimal. We take your financial security seriously and have taken measures to ensure your online shopping on experience our website safe for all customers.

Credit Card Authorization and Capture

When you place your order LifeProof authorizes your purchase by verifying that your card has the available funds. Authorizing your card confirms you have the funds available for purchase. Your credit card provider sets aside those funds so you may not spend it on anything else. LifeProof then captures the funds for purchased items when they are pending shipment (when the items are boxed and ready to be picked up by shipping company). If an item is back ordered for 29 days or more, LifeProof will capture $0.05 (5 cents), before the 29 days are up so as to keep the authorization from expiring. If an order is expected to ship later than 90 days and earlier than 120 days, LifeProof will again capture funds before the 90 days are up.

Do not use email to send us your financial information; email is not a secure channel.

You may submit any questions you may have about our security procedures by emailing us at administration@lifeproof.com

Legal Disclaimer

As indicated we reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process served on our website.
