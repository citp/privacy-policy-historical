                <p>
                    At Life-Answers.com, one of our top priorities is making sure that the information
                    we have about you is protected and secure.

                    We value our relationship with you and work hard to preserve your privacy. We do
                    collect personal information to allow us to personalize Horoscopes, Numerology and
                    Numerology reports. We regard all personal information - including birth data -

                    Information Collection &amp; Use</p>
                <p>
                    In order to receive any free or paid reports, daily forecast or other products we
                    provide, you must first complete an order form. When ordering you will need to make
                    certain entries (such as name, birth date and email address) so we can contact you
                    about periodic updates on various matters in which you've expressed an interest,
                    like: events that may impact your life, exclusive opportunities, referrals, and
                    discounts on materials that will help you make the most out of your life.</p>

                    Life-Answers.com is the sole owner of the information collected on Life-Answers.com.</p>
                <p>
                    If you purchase a product or service from Life-Answers.com, you will need to fill
                    in certain personal information on your order form. You will need to fill in contact
                    entries (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial entries (such
                    as credit card number, expiration date.) Life-Answers.com uses these items for billing
                    purposes and to fulfill your orders. If there is any problem in processing an order,
                    Life-Answers.com will contact you.</p>

                <p>
                    The entries you fill out on your order forms are used to calculate your Numerology
                    report and/or to provide you with a daily forecast that is personally relevant to
                    you because it is specifically based on your birth information. The entries are
                    also used to identify upcoming events and subjects that may interest or affect you,
                    so we can let you know about them and any opportunities or actions you can take
                    to make the most of conditions and chances to improve your life.</p>
