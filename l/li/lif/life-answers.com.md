Information Collection & Use

In order to receive any free or paid reports, daily forecast or other products we provide, you must first complete an order form. When ordering you will need to make certain entries (such as name, birth date and email address) so we can contact you about periodic updates on various matters in which you've expressed an interest, like: events that may impact your life, exclusive opportunities, referrals, and discounts on materials that will help you make the most out of your life.

Life-Answers.com uses these items for billing purposes and to fulfill your orders. If there is any problem in processing an order, Life-Answers.com will contact you.

Use of Entries 

The entries you fill out on your order forms are used to calculate your Numerology report and/or to provide you with a daily forecast that is personally relevant to you because it is specifically based on your birth information. The entries are also used to identify upcoming events and subjects that may interest or affect you, so we can let you know about them and any opportunities or actions you can take to make the most of conditions and chances to improve your life.
