### What happens to my data?

Your data is uploaded onto servers, all of which are in data centers in the United States of America.

We process your chosen member name and password to provide secure access to LifeOUT and your profile data.

We process your profile data to provide you with a page that enables your fellow-members to get to know you.

We pass your payment data directly to our payment provider when you purchase or renew a premium membership. Our payment provider supplies us with access to transaction details which, in exceptional circumstances, we may need to access to help confirm your identity should you contact us with a problem.

We process your contact details to reply to you.

#### An overview of the security measures that we take to look after your data

We employ several security measures to help limit the loss, damage, misuse and defacement of information that we control. Information that is gathered by us is stored on our secure servers in the United States of America, which are protected by physical and electronic security.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

#### How we process your photos and images

Photos that you upload to LifeOUT must meet the standards that we set out in our [User Agreement](https://www.lifeout.com/useragreement.php). The photographs are stored in the United States of America and are not permanently stored elsewhere. Any images that do not comply with our User Agreement are deleted. You can decide whether to make an image available for other members to view, to place the image in your private gallery or to delete it if you want to, however it may be moved to your private gallery automatically depending on the classification.

#### Automated Decisions

We use proprietary algorithms to detect spammers and abuse. If you think that you have been refused an account in error, you have a right to request that we assess your eligibility manually. You can request this by contacting our [Support Team](https://www.lifeout.com/support.php). Once assessed manually, LifeOUT's decision is final. We retain a small amount of data from applications that are refused to enable these algorithms to protect our members.

### Who else can see my data?

#### Access to your data by LifeOUT's Staff

Access to your data by LifeOUT's staff is restricted to only those required to provide and maintain our services to you. Should we need to access your data for any reason, we will inform you unless prevented from doing so by law. Please note, however, that some members of staff are also genuine members of our sites and are acting in a purely personal capacity in this regard.

#### Information sharing and Third Parties

To provide the best service to you we may have to share your personal data with the third parties set out in this privacy notice.

Our payment-processing partner uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that information between yourself and their servers is encrypted; the purchasing system is secure and any information passed between your computer or mobile device and the payment-processing computer cannot be read by anyone that happens to intercept it.

We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.
