This statement details our information gathering and dissemination practices for LifeOUT.com. If you have questions, comments, or concerns regarding this policy, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/support.php). 

Cookies

LifeOUT.com sets cookies in order to gather broad demographic information, to deliver content requested by you or specific to your interests, to customize our website for you, and to save your login credentials in order to allow you to visit member-only areas of LifeOUT.com. 

A cookie is a small string of data that is stored on your computer. LifeOUT.com only saves your login credentials if you request it; your password is encrypted, stored on your computer and transferred over the Internet in encrypted form. Note that you may refuse cookies; however, doing so may prevent certain LifeOUT.com features from working. 

Registration Form

Membership to the LifeOUT.com website is completely optional. LifeOUT.com registration requires that users provide contact information, such as name and email address, and also demographic information, such as a birth date. 

Aggregate demographic information collected through the registration process may be shared with advertisers and other partners. This information is not traceable to an individual user. 

Chat, IM, Forums, Polls, Community Tools

LifeOUT.com provides many options for member interaction and community, including chat, IM, forums, online polls, and other tools. In some cases, use of such tools may reveal a username or email address and may permit users to publish certain personal information (such as webpage links) on the LifeOUT.com website. In all cases, users affirmatively choose to expose or place this information in public areas of the LifeOUT.com website, and thereby agree that such information may be viewed by or forwarded to anyone. Users who do not want this information to be publicly available should not use these optional features of the LifeOUT.com website. Aggregate results of polls may be shared on the LifeOUT.com website. 

Profiles

LifeOUT.com permits users to submit personal information for use in our profiles. This information is stored for the purposes of member self-publishing and interaction and we may also use this information to customize your LifeOUT.com experience. By registering for LifeOUT.com and submitting your user information, you understand that anyone may have access to and forward this information. As with all parts of LifeOUT.com, we will not use LifeOUT.com profiles to knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18. 

Member Feedback

LifeOUT.com stores feedback sent to us by members. This feedback is used to administer and refine the LifeOUT.com website and associated services and at time may be shared with LifeOUT.com partners either in aggregate form or individually with specific characteristics about the member (such as email address and name) removed. 

IP Addresses

LifeOUT.com may track individual IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our service, to administer our site and to gather broad demographic information. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes. User IP address information is used only for our internal purposes. 

Additional Scenarios

LifeOUT.com may also disclose personal and aggregate information when required by a legal mechanism such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, or when we deem it necessary, in our sole discretion, to protect our rights and the safety of others, or our members, employees, or properties. 

Please remember that what you write or post in a public area such as a message forum is available to all LifeOUT.com members, and in many cases other visitors to the LifeOUT.com website. Also keep in mind that LifeOUT.com is not responsible for what other users may do with private conversations you've had with them. 

Off-Site Links

LifeOUT.com provides links to sites external to the LifeOUT Systems, LLC family. LifeOUT.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or contents of these other sites. 

Change/Modify Information

LifeOUT.com provides users the option to change or modify information previously provided. Visit the appropriate section of the website to make such changes.
