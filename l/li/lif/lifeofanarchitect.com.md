# Privacy Policy | Life of an Architect

The simple act of visiting a website leaves a trail of information, a “digital footprint,” about visitors like you. Sometimes this footprint is vague and preserves your anonymity and other times it is tied specifically to you and your real life identity.

If all you do is click around and read pages, the data captured about you is vague. If you leave a comment or sign up for a newsletter, the data captured about you is sometimes very specific. Almost all web sites on the web today collect data in this fashion about visitors, and this site is no different.

 **It is our belief that you deserve to know how we handle your information.** Consequently, the Privacy Policy below is a disclosure concerning our intent with your data. It is not a legally binding contract. It is a statement of intent made in good faith.

If you are unsure what something means, please ask. Contact information is available at the bottom of the Privacy Policy.

### Usage

Data is used for the express purpose of enabling you to read, respond to, and discover published content topical to this site, and nothing else.

### Duration

Data may be kept indefinitely.

### Commerce

Data is not ever bartered or sold for commercial gain.

### Advertising

Data is _**never**_ given to advertisers.

### Law Enforcement

Data is given to law enforcement only when legal process is followed.

### Analytic

Life of an Architect collects data about your activities that does not personally or directly identify you when you visit my website. This information may include the content you view, the date and time that you view this information, or the location information associated with your IP address. We use the information we collect to for no purpose other than to see where people are coming from, what they are looking at, and how long they are on site. This site uses Google Analytics to keep track and log this information, but at no time is this information distributed to any third party sites.
