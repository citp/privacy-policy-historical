# Privacy Policy - Life Without Limbs

LIFE WITHOUT LIMBS’ PRIVACY POLICY

Revised 5.25.2018

At Life Without Limbs, we strive to develop innovative services to better serve our users. We recognize that privacy is an important issue, so we design and operate our services with the protection of your privacy in mind. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information we gather when you use Life Without Limbs services, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard it, and how to withdraw consent.

The following principles apply to the personally identifying information we ask for and that you provide. “Personally identifying information” is information that individually identifies you, such as your name, physical address or email address.

**Data collection**  
Some services do not require any personally identifying information. Some of our services require you to register for an account.  In order to create an account users are asked for personally identifying information (typically your name, email address and a password for your account) and we will use that information to provide the service. For certain services and product purchases we may request credit card or other payment information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers.

When we require personally identifying information, we will inform you about the types of information we collect and how we use it. We hope this will help you make an informed decision about sharing your personal information with us.

**Withdraw Consent**

If you don’t want us to process your data anymore, please contact us at 818-706-3300, or send an email to info@lifewithoutlimbs.org or send us mail to PO Box 2430, Agoura Hills, CA  91376.

  * If you have an account, we may share the information submitted under your account among all of our services in order to provide you with a seamless experience and to improve the quality of our services.
