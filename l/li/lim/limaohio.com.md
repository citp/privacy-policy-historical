All activities which you engage in on this Site are voluntary. You are not required to provide any personal information to us unless you choose to access features or services on the Site which require the information.

Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.

Certain features of our Site require that you provide personal information in order to access circulation tools, e-mail blasts, e-ditions, and provide user comments.

Civitas reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor the user content you post on the Site. Civitas has the right to remove any such information or material for any reason or no reason including, without limitation, if in its sole opinion, such information or material violates, or may violate, any applicable law or our Terms of Service, or to protect or defend Civitas’s rights or property or those of any third party. Civitas also reserves the right to remove information upon the request of any third party.

We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our Site and services; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP; and (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in.

_**How We Share Your Information**_

**Personally Identifiable Information:** Civitas will not rent or sell your personal information to others. We disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to those of our employees, contractors (including website operators), affiliated organizations, service providers and other third parties that provide support services to us or help us market our products and services, administer our programs and operations, fulfill your requests, administer surveys, or process any other information on our behalf to provide services available at our Site.

Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, Civitas will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our Site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Civitas, our users or others.

We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our Site or services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful, as determined in our sole discretion. Release of your personal information for security purposes, as described in this Privacy Policy to any person or entity under any circumstances shall be based on a determination made solely by us, exercising our own discretion, permission for which is expressly granted by you to us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information:** We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain services.

_**How We Protect Your Information**_

Civitas utilizes commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards in line with industry standards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Civitas or the Site and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Civitas makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. While we strive to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online.

_**User Choices About Your Information**_

When using our Site you have the choice to update certain aspects of your personal information that you provide. For example, you may be able to update personal information such as your e-mail address when you post comments to our Site. However, if you have posted or submitted a news story to our Site under a former e-mail address prior to any updates, the previous e-mail address may remain.

**Do Not Track Disclosure:** Some browsers or other tools include “Do Not Track” (DNT) features which, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. The Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups and regulators to develop a DNT browser technology standard to provide a common understanding as to how to interpret the DNT signals, but to date no standard has been adopted. Since there is no standard at this time, Civitas does not currently respond to DNT signals. Civitas will follow the progress of the W3C in developing the standard.

_**Children’s Privacy (COPPA)**_

Civitas does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 should provide any personal information to or on this Site. In the event we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information promptly. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please [contact us](http://www.www.civitasmedia.com/contact). We encourage parents and guardians of children under 18 to regularly check and monitor their children’s use of email and other activities online.

We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site or the information or content contained therein. Civitas may provide links to other websites to you solely as a convenience, and the inclusion of linked sites does not imply endorsement by Civitas of any of the linked sites. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Site to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our Site, is subject to that website’s own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding. We do not ensure the security of your personal information if you visit websites not belonging to Civitas.
