Your privacy is very important to us. In fact, we treat it like it is our own. We handle your information privately, and with care, to ensure that your experience with us is positive in every way.

### How We Handle Your Personal Information

We respect your personal information. Your name, address(es), phone numbers, credit card information, and e-mail address **will never be sold or provided to a third party** for marketing reasons. To process credit card orders, your billing information will be sent to our merchant bank account. To ship your orders, we need to provide your name and shipping address to our shipping partners (see [Shipping Policies](https://web.archive.org/store/content/ShippingPolicy)). The rest of your information stays in our hands. On occasion, we may send you information about Lima Beads contests, specials and promotions, or new products.

## Use of Cookies on LimaBeads.com

Cookies are used on Lima Beads to keep track of the items in your shopping cart, to ensure a smooth checkout process, and to personalize the site for you when you return. We have a strict policy against third party cookies on our site, and never allow them at any time.

**What are cookies?**  
Cookies are small pieces of information that some web sites store on your computer. They allow the web site to differentiate you from other customers, in order to provide things like shopping carts, personalized selections, and custom greetings. They're never harmful to you unless the merchant uses them in sneaky ways--which we promise not to do.
