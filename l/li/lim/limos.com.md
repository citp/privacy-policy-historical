LC's: We share information with our third-party LC's so that they may provide quote information, may communicate with Customers directly to provide service information (typically to answer Customer questions, describe the LC's services or reservation request) and provide the limousine service itself. When you request a quote, a reservation or ask a question of an LC, we share your "Customer Criteria" with the LC in order for the LC to provide you with the above information about their limousine service. Your "Customer Criteria" includes your name, your communication preference (email and/or phone call), any email or phone number you provided, your limousine ride type, vehicle preferences, dates/times and location of service and any special requests you submitted.

## How Secure Is Information About Me?
