# Privacy policy | Limeade

This Privacy Policy is effective as of January 1, 2015.

Limeade, Inc. (“Limeade,” “our,” “we” or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy informs users (“you” or “your”) about what information we collect about you and how we may use or disclose your information. This Privacy Policy applies to information collected through the website limeade.com (the “Site”) and information collected through third party health, fitness, productivity or other applications (including from wearable devices), and from or through your health plan and its contractors, and covers the following areas:

  * What personally identifiable information Limeade, or a third party acting on Limeade’s behalf, collects through our Site and how we use it;
  * With whom Limeade may disclose this information;
  * What choices are available to you with respect to collection, use and distribution of your information;
  * What types of security procedures are in place to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information under our control; and
  * How you can request access to, or correct inaccuracies of, your information.



By using the Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

### More detailed list of the Privacy Policy

#### Personally Identifiable Information (“Personal Information”)

Personally Identifiable Information (or “Personal Information”) is information that we collect about you that can be used to identify or contact you, as well as other personal data.

Some of the Personal Information provided by you or collected by us in this Site may be health information. Although Limeade is not a “covered entity” under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), Limeade is subject to some aspects of HIPAA when Limeade performs services on behalf of covered entities, including health plans sponsored by employers for their employees (“Corporate Customers”). Limeade will comply with applicable HIPAA requirements under those circumstances.

#### Information Collection and Use

A.    _Automatically Collected Information_

We collect information about devices you use to access the Site (such as domain name and IP address) from all visitors to the Site (“Automatically Collected Information”). We use this information internally to help us improve your experience on the Site, including to create your profile and profiles of our users generally as well as to record internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We use the profiles and records to analyze trends, administer the Site, track movements in the aggregate, and gather broad aggregate demographic information.

For example, Limeade uses “cookies” and “web beacons” to collect information about your use of our Site and emails we may send you. Cookies are small computer files that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive that allow us to know how often you visit the Site and what activities you conduct on the Site. Internet browser software generally can be set to reject all cookies, and most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies. If you reject our cookie, certain functions and conveniences we automatically provide for you on our Site may not work, but you do not have to accept our cookie to use our Site. Similarly, web beacons are tiny graphic image files embedded in a web page or email that send information from your browser back to Limeade’s, or its service provider’s, server. We use the information cookies and web beacons collect to statistically monitor how many people are using our Site or opening our emails.

We do not link Automatically Collected Information to the health and other information you voluntarily provide to us through use of the Site.

As discussed above, because we track website usage information through the use of cookies, web beacons and other tracking mechanisms, your selection of the “Do Not Track” option provided by your browser may not have any effect on our collection of cookie information. The only way to completely “opt out” of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser to delete and disable cookies and other tracking/recording tools. However, getting a “Do Not Track” signal to work as you might want is difficult. Using browsers as an example, not all tracking technologies can be controlled by browsers; unique aspects of your browser might be recognizable even if you disable a tracking technology; not all settings will necessarily last or be effective; even if a setting is effective for one purpose data still may be collected for another; and even if one website observes a “Do Not Track” signal, that website usually will not be able to control other websites.

B.    _Subscription and Account Profiles_

We require the submission of a working email address for you to register to use the Site or receive notices about the Site. In certain cases, we may ask for other Personal Information such as name and date of birth. We use the Personal Information that you provide through registration to deliver relevant content and respond to questions from you and/or inform you of material changes to this Privacy Policy. You can opt-out of receiving email newsletters at the time you register or at any other time by clicking on the Email and Privacy tab on the Settings page. You may also elect to voluntarily submit additional Personal Information, for example your address, interests or photo, in order to enhance your profile on the Site. Submission of this Personal Information is strictly voluntary.

You may also elect to voluntarily submit additional Personal Information, for example your address, interests or photo, in order to enhance your profile on the Site. Submission of this Personal Information is strictly voluntary.

C.    _Limeade Resource Tools_

You may voluntarily provide other information to Limeade, some of which may be Personal Information, when you register for and use some of the Limeade resource tools, such as wellness assessments and goal tracking, or when you respond to our surveys and questionnaires. This information may include, but is not limited to, specific information regarding medical conditions, health, lifestyle, diet, exercise habits, drug and alcohol usage, workplace matters and other relevant Personal Information relating to your wellness.

D.    _Community Forums and Activity Feeds_

As a service to our users, Limeade may provide access to activity feeds and similar forums where users can share information or where users can post questions for other community members to answer. You should be aware that any information shared in an activity feed or other community forum is public information and may be seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties that do not adhere to and are not subject to our Privacy Policy. You should think carefully before posting any Personal Information in any community forum.

#### Personal Information of Children Under 13

This Site is not directed to children and we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under 13 years of age through this Site. If you think we have collected Personal Information from a child under 13 years of age for whom you are the parent or guardian, please contact us at the notice address provided below.

#### Disclosure of Your Personal Information to Third Parties

Unless we receive your permission, Limeade will not sell, rent, or share your Personal Information to or with any third party not affiliated with or owned by Limeade, with the following exceptions:

  * **Third Party Wellness Providers:** Limeade may disclose your relevant Personal Information to third parties who have been engaged on your behalf to provide disease management, health management, behavioral coaching, or similar wellness-related services (“Third Party Wellness Providers”), subject to contractual restrictions and conditions between Limeade and the Third Party Wellness Providers that obligate them to safeguard the Personal Information.. These Third Party Wellness Providers may contact you to offer their services in support of your health management goals. These Third Party Wellness Providers are separate and distinct entities from Limeade. If you agree to accept the services offered by a Third Party Wellness Provider, such agreement is solely between you and the Third Party Wellness Provider. Limeade is not responsible for the privacy practices or services of the Third Party Wellness Providers.
  * **Provision of Services:** Limeade may disclose your Personal Information to third parties that enable us to provide you with a product or service that you have requested from us. We will disclose Personal information to these third parties as necessary to enable them to provide the product or service.
  * **Participation, Incentives and Rewards:** Limeade may disclose your Personal Information to your health plan, which may be administered by your employer, in order for your employer or health plan to provide you or your spouse/same-sex domestic partner with incentives and rewards for participation in the Limeade service.
  * **Agents, Contractors, and Other Service Providers:** In order to provide you with the services on the Site, we may disclose your Personal Information to our agents, contractors, or other service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as incentive fulfilment, web hosting, translation or data storage. These third parties may also collect Personal Information on our behalf. Limeade will ensure that any agent, contractor, or other service provider to with whom we share Personal Information agrees to safeguard it in substantially the same manner as Limeade has described in this Privacy Policy, but in any event in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. Some of our service providers may be located outside of your country of residence, including in the United States of America, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and other countries from time to time. While outside of your country or residence, Personal Information will be subject to applicable foreign laws which may permit government, national security and regulatory authorities to access your Personal Information in certain circumstances.
  * **Translation Services:** If you choose to use our translation service, your username along with certain Personal Information will be provided to the translation service in order to provide you with the requested translations. If you are using the translation service, we recommend that you choose a username that does not explicitly identify you.
  * **HIPAA Covered Entities:** Limeade may disclose your Personal Information to entities subject to HIPAA (called “covered entities”). Covered entities include, for example, health care providers such as doctors and dentists. Covered entities are also health plans, including health plans sponsored by your employer and which may be administered by other employees of your employer. In the United States, these entities are subject to HIPAA and HIPAA requires covered entities to safeguard your Personal Information in accordance with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations.
  * **Aggregate Information:** Limeade may provide to third parties, including to our corporate customers, with information about you and other users from which we have removed all identifiers and that can no longer be used to identify you (“Aggregate Information”). For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of users of our Site and the services they used while on our Site. We may not limit the third parties’ use of the Aggregate Information, except that we do require third parties to whom we disclose Aggregate Information to agree that they will not attempt to make this information personally identifiable by combining it with other databases.
  * **Business Transitions:** In the event Limeade goes (or proposes to go) through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, reorganization, or sale of a portion of its assets, your Personal Information may be shared with parties connected with the proposed transaction as part of the due diligence process, and may be part of the assets acquired by and transferred to a new party taking over the business. The information transferred or shared remains subject to the promises made in our then-current Privacy Policy, unless you agree to new terms.
  * **Disclosure of Automatically Collected Information:** Limeade may provide to third parties, including to our corporate customers, Automatically Collected Information that is combined with the Automatically Collected Information of other users or Aggregate Information.



#### Additional Uses of Your Personal Information

  * **Administrative Notices:** Limeade reserves the right to send you specific administrative notices about your registration or subscription or to contact you if required by law. You may not opt-out of these kinds of communications.
  * **Emails and Newsletters:** During program registration and at various times as you use the Site, you may have the option of receiving emails or newsletters directly from Limeade. You may elect to opt-out of these communications by placing a check mark beside a statement that expresses a preference for not receiving these communications or participating in these activities.



#### Links

This Site contains links to other sites, including links to sponsors and partners (including our corporate customers). Limeade is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these other websites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by our Site.

#### Security

Limeade maintains administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of your Personal Information. For example, the file containing your Personal Information will be maintained in secure locations at our offices or on our servers (or those maintained by our service providers) with access limited to authorized employees, representatives and agents. Our employees receive training on our security practices and obligations. While we encrypt sensitive data, such as Personal Information, using SSL or VPN when it is transmitted over the Internet, we cannot completely ensure the privacy of email communications to and from our Site because they are not encrypted.

Given the nature of the Internet and the fact that network security measures are not infallible, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information. In the event we become aware of a data security breach, we will provide you with notice as required by applicable federal, provincial and state laws. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Limeade will provide any such notice to you at the email address you provide with your registration, as updated from time to time. By using the Site, you agree to accept such notice electronically.

Compliance with our security policies is periodically audited by our Chief Technology Officer and we continually assess the adequacy of, and where appropriate improve, our security controls and procedures. Limeade employees and our third party service providers must abide by this policy and those who violate it are subject to corrective action, up to and including termination of employment or other legal action as permitted by law.

To the extent that you are accessing the Site through an employer or health plan beneficiary portal or other third party website, we strongly encourage you to review and understand the privacy policies of such organizations prior to providing information to us or them that you consider to be sensitive or personal in nature.

When registering for access to a secure area of the Site, you will need to select a username and password. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also, remember to sign out of the registered Site and close your browser window when you have finished your work to ensure that others cannot access your Personal Information and correspondence when accessing your computer. Notify us promptly if you suspect someone has obtained unauthorized access to your Personal Information

If you have any questions about the security at our Site, you can send a message to member support at [support@limeade.com](mailto:support@limeade.com)

#### Correcting, Updating, and Deleting Personal Information

Users are able to self-administer key privacy settings via the Site in order to keep their Personal Information private. You can always contact us in order to request that we change or delete your Personal Information if you believe the Personal Information on the Site is incorrect. We will review your request but may be restricted in our ability to change or delete your Personal Information. If our Site was made available to you by a corporate customer that is sponsoring your usage of the Site, your eligibility to receive Incentives and Rewards from such parties, if any such benefits are offered, may be adversely affected by your election to remove your Personal Information from our service. You must contact the corporate customer directly for further information.

CALIFORNIA SHINE THE LIGHT LAW

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed personal information (as defined under that statute) of that California resident, for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the categories of personal information that was disclosed to them. If you are a California resident and you wish to make such a request, you may contact us by using the contact information in the “Contact Information” section at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.

#### Holding and Use of Personal Information

Limeade is based in the United States of America, and the Personal Information it collects about you, described in this Privacy Policy, is stored, processed and used in the United States of America in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By providing your Personal Information, you consent to it being transferred to Limeade in the United States of America. Limeade may also transfer, store, process or use your Personal Information throughout Australia or New Zealand and to other overseas countries. This may happen if Limeade’s related entities are located in those countries, if we outsource certain activities to overseas countries, or if transactions, information, services or products have an interstate (in Australia) or overseas connection, including if you have provided your Personal Information in the course of an activity that your organisation conducts involving its personnel from different countries around the world. You consent to the collection, use, storage, and processing of your Personal Information in the United States of America, throughout Australia or New Zealand, and in other overseas countries, where it will be stored and used for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

In particular, your personal information (including your health information) may be disclosed to third parties in the United States of America, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, and such other countries in which Limeade, our third party service providers, or your organisation or their, or our, computer systems may be located from time to time, where it may be used for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, without Limeade being responsible under the Australian Privacy Act or the New Zealand Privacy Act for such use (or for any breach). In these circumstances, you consent to the collection, use, storage and processing of your Personal Information in those countries. Where such parties are located outside of Australia, you may have rights to enforce such parties’ compliance with applicable data protection laws, but you may not have recourse against those parties under the Australian Privacy Act or New Zealand Privacy Act in relation to how those parties treat your personal information.
