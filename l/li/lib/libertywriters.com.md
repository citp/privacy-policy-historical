**(B)** In all circumstances listed in (A) above, we may perform these functions directly or use a third-party vendor to perform these functions on our behalf who will be obligated to use your personal information only to perform services for us. Also, if you access our Website from a third party social platform, such as Facebook, we may share non-personal information with that platform to the extent permitted by your agreement with it and its privacy settings. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the Website.  
**(C)** If you are a job applicant or service provider to the Company, and your personal information is submitted through the Website when applying for a position or job with the Company, the information will be used solely to consider and act upon your application materials. We may retain your personal information, but only to consider your application for current or future available positions or jobs.

**VII. Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information.**  
We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:  
**(A)** Tracking Technologies and Advertising. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. To learn how you can manage your Flash cookie settings, visit the Flash player settings page on Adobe’s website. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this site may then be inaccessible or not function properly.  
**(B)** Targeted Advertising. If you do not want us to use information that we collect or that you provide to us to deliver advertisements per our advertisers’ target-audience preferences, you can opt out by sending us an email stating your request to contact@libertywriters.com.  
**(C)** Do Not Track Disclosure. Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. However, because of the uncertainty of DNT in the internet industry, and the various factors and players conforming compliance, we may not recognize nor respond to DNT signals.  
**VIII. Accessing and Correcting Your Information.**  
If you choose to close your account or terminate your relationship with the Services, including by unsubscribing from the newsletter, we will retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, enforce our Terms of Use, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our Services or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy above, retention of that information will be subject to those companies’ policies, typically found on their websites.  
**IX. Deactivation; Termination of Your Account.**  
**(A)** When your account is deactivated or terminated, for any or no reason as may be determined by the Terms of Use, we take reasonable efforts to make sure it is no longer viewable on the Website. We are not responsible for any information, pictures, comments, or other content that is deleted from our systems resulting from the deactivation of your account.  
**(B)** To prevent abuse of the Website by a user following termination or deletion of an account, we shall retain such information as we deem in our sole discretion may be necessary to ensure that the user does not open a new account or profile in violation of our Terms of Use or other restrictions, and to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations.  
**(C)** After you remove information from your profile, if you created one, or delete your account, copies of that information may still be viewable or accessed to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or copied or stored by other users or to the extent such information has been shared with search engines. We cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for this. If you have given third party applications or websites access to your personal information, they may retain such information to the extent permitted subject to their respective terms of service or privacy policies. Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies owned by the Company for up to 30 days to enable restoration or reactivation subject to successful appeal to Company, but will not be available to other users in the meantime.  
**X. Your California Privacy Rights.**  
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of our Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to contact@libertywriters.com.  
**XI. Data Security.**  
We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.
