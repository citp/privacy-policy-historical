<h3>What Information Does LibyanSpider.com Collect?</h3>
<p>We receive and store any information you enter on our Site or give us in any other way, such as via telephone, electronic mail or online form. For example, this information may be collected when you register a domain name or</p>
<p>when you contact us for customer support. Here are the types of information we gather from visitors to LibyanSpider.com:</p>
<p style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #dddddd; width: 100%;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Contact Information:</h3>
<p>We are required by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"), the organization which assumes responsibility for domain name allocation, to collect certain information about you duringthe domain name registration process.</p>
<p>This information includes your full name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and, where provided, your facsimile number. Such contact information may be used, for example, to communicate with you when necessary with respect to transactions conducted through the Site. Additionally, we may collect contact information provided to us during any correspondence relating to customer support we supply to you, as well as in connection with products and services offered on the Site.</p>
<p style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #dddddd; width: 100%;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Financial Information:</h3>
<p>We also collect and retain certain financial information from you during the domain name registration process, as well as in connection with other products and services which we offer on the Site. For example, when you apply to register a domain name or sign up for any other product or service through LibyanSpider.com, we require you to provide a credit card number and billing address before we will process that application. We will not sell, share or rent any financial information collected from you except as disclosed in this policy or as necessary to fulfill your order.</p>
<p style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #dddddd; width: 100%;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Demographic Information:</h3>
<p>We may collect and store anonymous demographic information (such as your zip code, gender and age), and use this data to tailor your experience at our Site, provide content that we think you might be interested in, and display the content according to your preferences. Such demographic information may be shared with partners, market researchers and other third parties on an aggregate, non-personally identifiable basis. No personally identifiable information will be linked to aggregated demographic information.</p>
<p style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #dddddd; width: 100%;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #dddddd; width: 100%;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Other Information:</h3>
<p>We collect and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, our servers track the type of Web browser you are using, and the page to which you link from LibyanSpider.com. We collect this information to better develop a sense of what services our customers need, but not to track your individual usage patterns, except within the Site. We may use such information for marketing purposes, and to send information to you which we believe might be of interest. In addition, such information may be shared with partners, market researchers and other third parties on an aggregate, non personally identifiable basis.

This information includes your full name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and, where provided, your facsimile number, as well as the creation and expiration dates of your domain name registration and the name server information associated with your domain name.

<p style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #dddddd; width: 100%;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Third Parties:</h3>
<p>If you have opted-in to receiving information about products and services provided by LibyanSpider.com's partners and affiliates, we will share your name, address, phone number and email address, in addition to information provided by you in response to our opt-in survey, so that the appropriate partners and affiliates may contact you regarding the products and services in which you have expressed interest. LibyanSpider.com cannot guarantee that these third parties will offer the same level of protection as LibyanSpider.com, or that their protections will be adequate.</p>
<p style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #dddddd; width: 100%;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Agents and Service Providers:</h3>
<p>We engage other companies, individuals and subsidiaries of LibyanSpider.com to perform certain functions and/or services to our customers. Examples may include processing credit card payments, providing marketing assistance and removing repetitive information from customer lists, as well as offering electronic mail services and making available digital certificates.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you register a domain name through LibyanSpider.com, we may forward certain information you provide to the appropriate registry handling the administration of your chosen top level domain. Your contact and financial information may either be collected by or shared with such third parties as necessary, and in some cases, your information may be retained or used by such third parties.</p>
<p style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #dddddd; width: 100%;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Partner Web Sites and Pages.</h3>
<p>LibyanSpider.com sometimes enters into agreements in which we jointly develop or operate Web sites with third parties ("Partner Site"). Any information collected via a Partner Site may be jointly owned by LibyanSpider.com and the applicable third party partner, or, alternatively, owned solely by us or the third party partner. It is your responsibility to check the privacy policy of such third parties before submitting any personal information to a Partner Site.</p>
<p style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #dddddd; width: 100%;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Business Transfers:</h3>
<p>As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or their assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, if LibyanSpider.com, . or all or substantially all of its assets were ever to be acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</p>
<p style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #dddddd; width: 100%;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Protection of LibyanSpider.com and Others:</h3>
<p>We may release account and other personal information when we are required to do so by law, court order or other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency, including ICANN; to enforce or apply our Services Agreement or other agreements; or when we believe in good faith that disclosing this information is necessary or advisable, including, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety of LibyanSpider.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
<p>Electronic Mail From time to time, LibyanSpider.com may use your personal information to contact you by electronic mail concerning our services.

<p style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #dddddd; width: 100%;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How Secure Is Information About Me?</h3>
<p>We work to protect the security of your financial information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") software, which encrypts the information you input on the Site. Additionally, we reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we must transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. You can further help to ensure your security by taking a few simple precautions. For instance, it is important to protect against unauthorized access to your LibyanSpider.com username and password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.</p>
<p>We will take reasonable care to protect your personal information once it is transferred to us, but it is ultimately your responsibility to prevent the disclosure of your personal information outside of LibyanSpider.com, as well as any disclosure on the LibyanSpider.com Site which is due to your error.</p>
<p style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #dddddd; width: 100%;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>LibyanSpider.com gives you the ability to access your contact information for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. Past customers may view this information by emailing their request to Customer Service. When you update your information, we may keep a copy of the prior version for our records.</p>
<p style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #dddddd; width: 100%;">&nbsp;</p>
