##    
Our security measures

Our university websites have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under our control. We utilize industry standard SSL encryption when accepting your credit card information during the online ordering process, as well as whenever we ask you to log in to any of the university's online student and faculty services.

##  Your Privacy

Liberty University does not sell, rent, or share your personal information to any outside organizations. Liberty will abide by all applicable laws governing the release of personal information.

Collective information about site users – but never individuals’ information – is used in marketing, advertising and other relationships with third parties.

##  COPPA notice

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, applies to the collection of personal information from children under 13. The Liberty University Online Academy ([www.libertyonlineacademy.com](http://www.libertyonlineacademy.com/)) offers programs for students in grades K-12. It collects personal identifying information through its inquiry and application forms. Although the forms ask for the personal information of the parent or guardian, not the child, Liberty University Online Academy realizes that children may occasionally fill out and submit these forms.

Parents may ask to have the child’s personal identifying information deleted by using the contact information below.

Our student and faculty services sites, including ASIST, provide you with the option of changing and modifying information you have previously provided to us.

##  Changes to this policy

The university reserves the right to append or otherwise modify this Privacy Policy at any time. We expect any such changes to be minor, and notification of all changes will be made on this page. Each version of the Privacy Policy will be dated at the bottom of the page.
