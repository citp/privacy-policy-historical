<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

<p>Librato, Inc. ("Librato") is committed to protecting your privacy. We have
prepared this Privacy Statement to describe to you our practices regarding the
Technical Data and Personal Data (as defined below) we collect from users of our
websites, the Librato products (the "Products"), or related services.</p>

<h2>User Consent</h2>

<p>By submitting or making available Technical Data or Personal Data through our
websites, Products, or related services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy
Statement and you consent to the processing of your Technical Data and Personal
Data in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Your Personal Data may be
processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries,
including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data
may be less stringent than the laws in your country.</p>

<h2>A Note About Children</h2>

<p>We do not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors who are under the
age of 13.</p>

<h2>Types of Data We Collect</h2>

<p>Librato collects Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you when you visit our
site, when you send us information or communications, and/or when you download
and use our Products. "Personal Data" means data that allows someone to identify
or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number,
e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is
associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. "Anonymous Data" means
data about you that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data (but
does not include Technical Data, which is covered later in this Privacy
Statement); Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual
persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.</p>

<h2>Personal Data You Provide to Us</h2>

<p>We collect Personal Data from you, such as first and last name, e-mail and
mailing addresses, telephone number, professional title, company name, and
password, when you purchase Products, register to receive information, or
register for support forums. In addition, we (or our third-party credit card or
payment processor on our behalf) will collect Personal Data including your
credit card number or account information when you purchase Products or services
on our websites. We also retain information on your behalf, such as the Personal
Data described above and any correspondence or forum postings. If you provide us
feedback or contact us via e-mail (e.g., in response to an employment
opportunity posted on our websites), we will collect your name and e-mail
address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send
you a reply, and any information that you submit to us, such as a resume. When
you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile
information. When you post messages on the message boards of our websites, the
information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other
users will be able to see it. We also collect other types of Personal Data that
you provide to us voluntarily, such as operating system and version, information
about your application and operating environment, and other requested
information if you contact us via e-mail regarding support for the Products). We
may also collect Personal Data at other points in our websites that state that
Personal Data is being collected.</p>

<h2>Personal Data Collected via Technology</h2>

<p>To make our websites, Products, and related services more useful to you, our
servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) collect Personal
Data from you, such as browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP)
address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use
the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a
date/time stamp for your visit. We may also use Cookies (as defined below) and
navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information
regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for
which you searched and which you viewed. Like most Internet services, we
automatically gather this Personal Data and store it in log files each time you
visit our websites or access your account on our network.</p>

<p>"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's
hard drive while you are viewing a web site. We may use both session Cookies
(which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which
stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more
personal and interactive experience on our websites. Persistent Cookies can be
removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to
disable Cookies, some areas of our websites may not work properly.</p>

<h2>Personal Data Collected by Third Parties</h2>

<p>We may receive Personal Data about you from other sources like telephone or fax,
from companies that provide our Products or services by way of a co-branded or
private-labeled website, companies that offer their products and/or services on
our websites, or companies that provide services (such as payment processing
services) in connection with our websites ("Partner Companies"). Our Partner
Companies may supply us with Personal Data, such as your name and e-mail and
mailing address information, in order to help us establish the account or
fulfill orders. We may add this information to the information we have already
collected from you via our websites in order to perform and improve the Products
and services we provide.</p>
