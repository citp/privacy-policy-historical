# Privacy & Security Policy | Your Security and Privacy | Liberty Travel

This Privacy and Security Policy ("Policy") explains how your personal information will be treated by FC USA Inc dba Liberty Travel or any of our affiliates ("we" "our" or "us"). We are firmly committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal information and we maintain robust physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect personal information in our care. We reserve the right to amend this Policy at any time. Your continued use of our services or those on www.libertytravel.com ("Website") following such modification will be conclusively deemed acceptance by you of any changes to this Policy. The term "Third Party" used in this Policy means any entity other than us.

**Collection of personal information from site users of our Website**  
Where practical we will collect personal information directly from you. Generally this will be collected by us when you deal with us either in person, by telephone, letter, facsimile, email or when you visit our Website. Without limitation, we may collect your personal information as follows:

A) We collect and/or track (1) the home server domain names, e-mail addresses, IP addresses, type of computer, and type of web browser of visitors to the Website, (2) the e-mail addresses of visitors that communicate with us or the Website via e-mail, (3) information knowingly provided by the visitor in online forms (including travel preferences, such as seat selection, meal requests, frequent flyer/hotel/car rental program information, and ticketing options), registration forms, surveys, and contest entries (including name, address, e-mail and other personal profile data), (4) aggregate and user-specific information regarding page views and other online activities, and (5) other information gathered through our weblogs or other interactive forums. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to utilize the Website and/or to purchase products or services; complete a traveler profile; participate in a survey, contest, or sweepstakes; or initiate other transactions on the Website. When you make travel or other arrangements for someone else through the Website, we will request personal information and travel preferences about that individual. You should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing us with their personal information and travel preferences.

B) We place "cookies" on visitors' hard drives. Cookies save data about individual visitors, such as the visitor's name, password, username, screen preferences, the pages of a site viewed by the visitor, and the advertisements viewed or clicked by the visitor. When the visitor revisits the Website, we may recognize the visitor by the cookie and customize the visitor's experience accordingly. Visitors may decline cookies, if any, by using the appropriate feature of their web client software, if available; however, this may impair certain features of the Website.

C) When a visitor performs a search within the Website, we may record information identifying the visitor or linking the visitor to the search performed. We may also record limited information associated with every search request made by the visitor and use that information to, among other things, solve technical problems with the service and to calculate overall usage statistics.

We are required by law to obtain your consent to the collection of sensitive information. We will assume that you have consented to the collection of all information which is provided to us for use in accordance with this Policy, unless you tell us otherwise.

**Use of personal information collected**  
We will only collect personal information that is relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. We may use personally identifiable information in a number of ways, such as:

A) To communicate with you about your account, or to communicate information about the Website.

B) To build higher quality, more useful services such as by analyzing usage trends, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Website.

C) To provide you with prompt and effective customer service.

D) To support the operation of the Website (such as account maintenance and record keeping), troubleshoot problems, resolve disputes, and to enforce our terms and conditions.

We may disclose personally identifiable information about you to Third Parties as follows:

We may disclose personal information even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, to the extent we feel is necessary to inform and cooperate with law enforcement agencies or other appropriate authorities.

G) Due to circumstances beyond our control. We shall take reasonable steps to protect the Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Despite the precautions we take to protect your personal information, the unfortunate fact is that there is simply no such thing as a perfect security system. Also, we have no control over the security of the internet in general. As a result, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will never gain access to your transmissions or information, or that personal information will never be disclosed in ways not covered by this Policy.

H) In connection with a transfer, reorganization or otherwise, to a successor-in-interest to our organization or its other material assets. When a Third Party acts as our agent, we will ensure that the Third Party is willing to enter into a written agreement requiring the Third Party to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant principles.

**Trans-Border data flows**  
In providing our services to you it may be necessary for us to forward personal information to relevant overseas Third Party service providers or our affiliates, licensees overseas. Please let us know if you have any objections to such transfers.

**Security of information**
