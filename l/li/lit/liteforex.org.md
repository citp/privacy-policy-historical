**ABOUT COOKIES**

Cookies are small files containing information that a Web site uses to track its visitors.

This type of technology protects you from having your information intercepted by anyone other than LiteForex while it is being transmitted to us. We work hard to ensure that our websites are secure and that they meet industry standards. We also use other safeguards such as firewalls, authentication systems (e.g., passwords and personal identification numbers) and access control mechanisms to control unauthorized access to systems and data.
