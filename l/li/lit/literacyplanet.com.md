We have implemented this Privacy Policy in order to inform you about how we will collect, store, use your personal information and under what circumstances we may disclose your personal information.

Please note that this Privacy Policy forms part of the [Intrepica Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20130519214445id_/http%3A//www.literacyplanet.com/terms.html "Intrepica Terms of Use") document, which is displayed at the bottom of the Website.

#### Information we collect from you

From time to time, we may ask you to supply personal information such as your name, gender, address, date of birth, telephone number, e-mail address, whether you have any allergies or pre-existing health conditions.

  * political, religious or philosophical beliefs or affiliations;
  * sexuality;
  * racial or ethnic origin; or
  * criminal convictions.



We may also conduct surveys or market research and may seek other information from you on a time-to-time basis. These surveys will provide us with information that allows improvement in the types and quality of service offered to you, and the manner in which those services are offered to you.

#### Personal information via the Website

Your personal information, including your e-mail address, will be used for three primary purposes:

  * to ensure the proper functioning of the Website; and
  * to assist us with our marketing, planning, product development and research requirements.



We will not use or disclose (or permit the use or disclosure of) personal information that could be used to identify an individual member in any circumstances except:

  * to communicate promotional offers and special events to you; 
  * to avoid risks to health and safety of an individual or society at large;
  * where the law requires us, or authorises us to do so; or

We will not sell, distribute, rent, licence, disclose, share or pass your personal information onto any third parties, other than those who are contracted to us to keep the information confidential whether subject to a statute or a scheme which imposes similar restrictions to the National Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) regarding the handling of personal information.

#### Terms of Use

We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that all information collected from you is accurate, up to date, complete and stored in a secure environment and accessed only by our authorised personnel.
