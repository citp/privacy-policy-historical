Before submitting your personal information to our Website, please read this Privacy Policy carefully to learn about our privacy practices.

**What We Collect From You**

We receive and store the information you enter on our Website or give us in any other way. This includes information that can identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and e-mail addresses, user name and password. We may also request information about your personal profile. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general, some information about you is required in order for you to enjoy the benefits of being a registered member. In addition, some information is also required in order for you to ask us a question or initiate other transactions on our Website.

**Cookies and Other Web Technologies**

Cookies are small data text files and can be stored on your computer’s hard drive (if your Web browser permits). Little Day Out uses cookies for the following general purposes:

(a) To help us recognise your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting our site. For example, if you register on our site, we may use cookies to remember your registration information, so you do not need to log into our site each time you visit. We also may record your password in a cookie, if you checked the box entitled "Keep me signed in on this computer unless I sign out.”

(b) To help measure and research the effectiveness of website features and offerings, advertisements, and email communications (by determining which e-mails you open and act upon).

Most browsers should allow you to choose to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, or have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable non-essential types of cookies. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to access parts of our Website.

**Email Communications**

We want to make it easy for you to take advantage of children-related opportunities on our Website.

We believe these email messages will provide you with useful information about children-related offers. Please note that you will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these email messages in any such email we send.

In addition to these communications, if you have provided an email address, we may use your personal information to send you notifications about special offers or to tell you about opportunities available from our partners. You may opt-out of any or all marketing communications from Little Day Out in any commercial e-mail we send or at any time, as well as access and update your personal information, by visiting www.littledayout.com and logging into your profile.

**How We Protect Your Data** ** **

We do not share your personal contact information (such as email addresses) with unaffiliated third parties so they can serve you with advertisements.

We may allow third parties to collect information about your online activities through cookies and other technologies. These third parties include (1) business partners, who collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our sites, and (2) advertising networks, who collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on many different Web sites on the Internet. The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements on our sites and across the Internet tailored to your interests.

We do not permit these third parties to collect personal contact information about you (such as email address) on our site, nor do we share with them any personal information about you.

Please note that we do not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy.

**With whom we share your information**

Little Day Out may share your information with the following entities:

(a) _Third-party vendors_ who provide services or functions on our behalf, including business analytics, customer service, marketing, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes programs, and fraud prevention. We may also authorise third-party vendors to collect information on our behalf, including as necessary to operate features of our website or to facilitate the delivery of online advertising tailored to your interests. Third-party vendors have access to and may collect information only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.

(b) _Business partners_ with whom we may offer products or services in conjunction. You can tell when a third party is involved in a product or service you have requested because their name will appear either with ours or separately. If you choose to access these optional services, we may share information about you, including your personal information, with those partners. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party business partners.

We also may share your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.

We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors our Web site receives. This information does not contain any personal information and is used to develop content and services we hope you will find of interest.
