  * ##### How is My Information Shared?

Personal Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your indentifiable personal Information to anyone. 

  * ##### Friends and Followers:

Friends on Little: Your friends can see, for example, your location (as described in more detail below). 

Followers and people/brands you follow on Little: Followers can see your publicly available information and you can see the publicly available information of users you follow, as described below (under "Publicly Available Information and Apps"). 

Individuals reading this information may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in comments, plans or tips or other content (location or otherwise) that you create in the Services. 

Businesses, Locations, Events and Brands: One of the key purposes of the Services is to help users learn about businesses, locations, events and brands (for example, a restaurant or a movie theater or a hotel) that are relevant to them, and for these entities to provide information about themselves, their locations and events to users, as well as to reward users when they visit their location or event through offers and specials.

We may also share or disclose aggregated and anonymous data, such as de-identified location data, to third parties, including users you may follow and users of our Service, for analytical or other purposes. 

  * ##### Determining your location.

The Services deal with location, so in order to work, the Services need to know your location. Whenever you open and use/interact with our apps on your mobile device or go to one of our Sites, we use the location information from your mobile device or browser (e.g., latitude and longitude) to tailor the Services experience to your current location (i.e., we'll show you a list of nearby locations, friends and tips). This information is NOT shared in a form that is identified with you with others unless you are using a service that they offer. Also, the Services use your mobile device's ‘background location to provide the Services, including to send you notifications of tips/friends/plans/interesting things etc. near you. If you have ‘background location turned on, the Little app will, from time to time, tell us about your device's location even if you are not directly interacting with the application. 

  * ##### Sharing Location with the Little app.

Your real-time location is not shared with anyone on the Little app in a form that identifies you.If you use a service from one of our merchants, write a tip, like or otherwise interact with a place, users may infer that you have been to that location. Some content, like tips, are time stamped and other users could use that information to infer when you were at a place even though tips can be posted when you aren't at the place you are leaving a tip about. 

Your location data is ONLY shared with others when you proactively decide to "purchase" a deal from one of the merchants on our platform. "Others" in this scenario ONLY represents the owner of the service / product that you have purchased. 

By default, location sharing is turned on and at a radius level is shared with your Little friends and is updated from time to time using your background location. You can turn off neighborhood sharing. Your location is also shared when you proactively decide to "purchase with a "check in" is the location information of that place. Additionally, when you send a message on Little, your mobile device's location is shared with all recipients of the message. 

  * ##### Your Location History

We store your location history to provide you better quality deals. This information is treated as private under any and all circumstances and is NEVER shared.
