# Privacy Policy

The Little League Privacy Policy has been written to answer questions you might have about this issue. As a youth organization we are very concerned about privacy. Therefore, we have taken measures to tailor our content and offerings to help protect an individual’s privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to information collected on Little League International authored websites such as: [www.littleleague.org](https://web.archive.org/); [www.littleleaguestore.net](http://www.littleleaguestore.net/); and our official pages on Facebook, Twitter as well as information received from other sources such as charter enrollment and player records reporting.

**Our Commitment to Security**

Little League Baseball, Incorporated has implemented physical, electronic and managerial processes to safeguard the privacy of the information it obtains. 

**Advice to Children and Parents**

We strongly advise children to get their parent(s) or guardian(s) to review any information they intend to transmit and get their permission before submitting any kind of personal data to anyone over the Internet. We urge parents to repeatedly discuss with their children the danger of giving personal information to anyone (online or in person) whom they don't personally know. We also encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children monitoring and reviewing their children’s online activity. As a policy, no person under the age of 13 is permitted to register directly to receive Little League’s electronic communications. 

**What personal information do we collect for our electronic database?**

Little League Baseball, Incorporated requires chartered Little Leagues to submit player registration data and coach/manager data to be in compliance with Regulation IV (g) as well as league officer information at the time of chartering annually. Complete data for all players, managers/coaches and league officers is required. Player registration data must include the date of birth of the player and parent or guardian contact information. The local league must verify the accuracy of such information annually. A player, manager or coach must be listed on the data submitted to Little League International in order to be covered by Little League National Accident Insurance, provided it is purchased by the league.

All data is submitted electronically through the secure “Little League Data Center” on [www.LittleLeague.org/datacenter](https://web.archive.org/datacenter) _._ This website details the acceptable formats including a downloadable spreadsheet as well as from reports available from the ACTIVE Network’s league management software ([www.ACTIVE.com](http://www.active.com/)).
