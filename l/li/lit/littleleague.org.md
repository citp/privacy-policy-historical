# Privacy Policy

The Little League Baseball Electronic Privacy Policy has been written to answer questions you might have about online privacy. As a youth organization, we are very concerned about privacy and go to extraordinary measures to safeguard any personal information we may collect about you or your children. Therefore, we have taken additional measures to tailor our content and offerings to help protect their privacy online. This policy refers only to information collected on this web site and other Little League International authored sites such as the www.littleleague.org, www.littleleaguestore.net and our official pages on Facebook and Twitter.

**Our Commitment to Security**  
Little League Baseball, Incorporated has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial processes to safeguard the information we collect and prevent unauthorized access of information.

**Advice to Children and Parents**  
We strongly advise children to get their parent's or guardian's permission before submitting any kind of personal data over the Internet. We urge parents to be very clear with their children regarding the danger of giving personal information to anyone (online or in person) they don't know. We also encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the activities offered on the sites they visit.

**What personal information do we collect?**  
At Little League International, we don't collect personal information about you or your children online (name, address, e-mail, and so on) unless you provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. At times, through our web sites, you can enter contest or participate in a promotion, express your opinion, online shop or subscribe to our online portals and newsletters. The only times we will ask for personal or contact information from you will be:  


  1. To enable us to respond to your inquiry 
  2. To register you for a contest or promotion 
  3. To take your subscription for a Little League publication or web-based portal 



If you do not want your personal information collected, even for these reasons, please do not submit it to us. You also have the opportunity to “opt-out” of any Little League controlled electronic communication at any time by clicking here.

**How do we use it?**  
Any information gathered on this website will be used for the sole purpose of furthering the mission of Little League Baseball Incorporated. Little League Baseball Incorporated does not provide information collected from you under any circumstance, unless it is to provide useful information to you regarding rule changes, bulletins, special offers, and the like. We may use the information you provide to fulfill your requests for information or products, to respond to your inquiries about our program, to provide you with information on selected partner products’ promotions or offers available only to electronic database registrants that we believe may be of interest to you. We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to update you on new rules and regulations, notify you when you have won a contest, or provide you with the latest news story being covered by Little League International.

The information you provide in connection with our online forums and communities is used to create an interactive experience. We may use this information to facilitate conversation and from time to time, offer you products, programs and services.

Should you receive information from Little League or one of our partners, this information will be clearly identified with Little League International identification marks in adherence with our trademark registration.

Please note that some information you receive may direct you to a non-Little League web site to participate in a contest or promotion. Please refer to these web sites for specific Privacy Policies and use of data as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

**Contest Submissions and Promotions**  
We sometimes offer contests, games, and promotions on behalf of Little League and our partners; or invite you to submit stories, comments, or questions to certain areas of our site. On these occasions, we may ask you to voluntarily submit your e-mail address along with your contest entry or submission so that we can notify you if you are a winner, or to respond to (or ask) questions.
