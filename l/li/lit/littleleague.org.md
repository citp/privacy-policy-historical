## Our Commitment to Security

## Advice to Children and Parents

We strongly advise children to get their parent(s) or guardian(s) to review any information they intend to transmit and get their permission before submitting any kind of personal data to anyone over the Internet. We urge parents to repeatedly discuss with their children the danger of giving personal information to anyone (online or in person) whom they don’t personally know. We also encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children monitoring and reviewing their children’s online activity. As a policy, no person under the age of 13 is permitted to register directly to receive Little League’s electronic communications or participate in Little League social media activities. Such activity, if deemed appropriate, must be conducted by the parent or guardian of such individuals.
