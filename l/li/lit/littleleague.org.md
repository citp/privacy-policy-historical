**Advice to Children and Parents**

We strongly advise children to get their parent(s) or guardian(s) to review any information they intend to transmit and get their permission before submitting any kind of personal data to anyone over the Internet. We urge parents to seriously and repeatedly discuss with their children the danger of giving personal information to anyone (online or in person) whom they don't personally know.

Rosters should be submitted through the “Little League Data Center” on [www.LittleLeague.org](https://web.archive.org/). This web site will provide a downloadable spreadsheet as well as accepting formats from licensed products and through products available from the Active Network ([www.active.com](http://www.active.com/)). This is an easy way to provide the required data on players, managers and coaches, and ensures that Little League International receives the data that is required as noted above. 

The information provided on rosters is utilized by Little League International in the following ways: 

  * To catalog and record each individual player into a yearly listing of participants in the Little League program.

  * To maintain a record of the coaches and managers involved in the Little League program and their associated team and league. This information is used to provide seasonal training materials, to send the Little League Magazine for their team’s players during the season as well as operational issues that may arise requiring contact with Little League International. 
  * Email addresses provided to Little League International through the league player record sharing process by each player’s parent(s) or guardian(s), and coach and/or manager are incorporated into Little League International’s electronic database for the current season. Individuals receive an “Opt-In” email announcement and are given the choice to opt-in to receive communications from Little League. The privacy policy below describes our process for collecting and using email addresses of our constituents.
