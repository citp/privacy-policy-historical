# Privacy Policy | Litographs

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Litographs collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Litographs’ purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Litographs’ visitors use its website. From time to time, Litographs may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Litographs’s websites choose to interact with Litographs in ways that require Litographs to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Litographs gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Those who engage in transactions with Litographs are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Litographs collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Litographs. Litographs does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

Litographs may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. However, Litographs does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Litographs discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Litographs’s behalf or to provide services available at Litographs’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Litographs’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Litographs will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Litographs discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Litographs believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Litographs, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Litographs website and have supplied your email address, Litographs may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Litographs and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. Litographs takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Litographs uses cookies to help Litographs identify and track visitors, their usage of Litographs website, and their website access preferences. Litographs visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Litographs’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Litographs’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Business Transfers

If Litographs, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Litographs goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Litographs may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Litographs may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Litographs’s sole discretion. Litographs encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
