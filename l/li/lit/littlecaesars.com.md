**1\. INFORMATION COLLECTED OUT ON SITES**

**a. Personal and Demographic Information**. We may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information including: (1) personally identifiable information, such as your name, e-mail address, birth date, credit card number, and physical address (“ **Personal Information** ”); and (2) demographic information, such as gender, zip code, or similar information (“ **Demographic Information** ”). We may collect this information through various forms and places on the Sites, including account registration forms, newsletter sign-ups, gift card order forms, franchise inquiry forms, resume submission forms, contact us forms, and when you otherwise communicate with us via the Sites. If we combine Demographic Information with Personal Information we collect, we will treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. Of course, you are free to visit our Sites without providing any Personal Information or Demographic Information but some parts of the Sites may not be available to you if choose note to provide this information. 

**b. Anonymous Information**. When you interact with our Sites, our servers may keep an activity log that does not identify you individually (“ **Anonymous Information** ”). We collect and store certain administrative and traffic information with each use of the Sites including: source IP address, time of access, date of access, web page(s), type of browser used, access times and referring websites addresses. If we associate Anonymous Information with you as a specific person, we will treat it as Personal Information 

**c. Device Identifiers**. We automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“ **Device Identifier** ”) for your Device used to access our Sites. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Sites, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or other third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access the Sites.

Web Beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a Web Beacon.
