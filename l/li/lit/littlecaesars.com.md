**The Full Detailed Privacy Policy**

**1. What Information Does the Service Collect?**

**a. Information You Provide to Us.**

**Personal Information and Demographic Information.**  On the Service, we may ask you to provide us (and/or our vendors) with the following categories of information: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you personally, including your first and last name, phone number, e-mail address, home address, credit card information (“ **Personal Information** ”); and (2) demographic information, including your zip code, frequency of visits, purchase amounts, and items purchased (“ **Demographic Information** ”). We can collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Service or when you interact with the Service. To the extent we combine Demographic Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. 

**b. Information We Collect or Store As You Access and Use the Service Generally.**

In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Service, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that store or collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Service (“ **Usage Information** ”).  This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a “ **Device** ”) whenever you visit or interact with our Service.  To the extent we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat it as Personal Information. 

**This Usage Information includes:**

  * your IP address, UDID, advertising identifier, and device identifier (“ **Device Identifier** ”).  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Service, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;
  * your Device functionality (browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);
  * the URL that referred you to our Service;
  * the areas within our Service that you visit and your activities there;
  * your Device location;
  * your Device characteristics; and
  * Device data and the time of day.



Our App may access and read accounts, data and/or content on your Device, add content to your Device, and change settings of your Device, for the following reasons (i) allowing you to access and use the Service (or certain of its features and functions); (ii) showing you the closest Little Caesars to you; (iii) saving app images and sound files and writing usage logs to the Device; (iv) sending Facebook and Twitter messages you initiate; (v) sending and receiving data needed for App operations;   (vi) to provide you notice when you are not connected to a network; and (vii) in connection with your Service usage.  You consent to these activities by installing the App or otherwise using the Service.  Your Device settings may enable you to disable, change or limit some of these activities (See **Section 6** for more information) and you can disable all of them associated with the App by uninstalling the App.

We may use various now and later developed methods and technologies to store or collect Usage Information (“ **Tracking Technologies** ”).  Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device.  The App may also receive signals from and otherwise interact with Tracking Technologies that exist in the physical world.   Tracking Technologies include:

  * **_Cookies._**  A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Service.  A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage.  Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in. 
  * **_Web Beacons._**  Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “ **1x1 GIFs** ” or “ **clear GIFs** ”) may be included in our Service’s pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons or similar technologies can be used to count visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
  * **_Embedded Scripts._** An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about the links you click on and other of your interactions with the Service.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
  * **_Browser Fingerprinting._**  Collection and analysis of information from your Device, including your operating system, plug-ins, and system fonts, for purposes of identification.
  * **_ETag, or entity tag._** A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL.  If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned.  Used in this manner, ETags are a form of Device Identifier.  ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies. 
  * **_Location-identifying Technologies._**  Additionally, the Services may use GPS (global positioning systems) software, RFID (radio frequency identification), cellular and Wi-Fi data, and other subsequent location-based technologies and methods later developed. These can use geo-fencing and iBeacons to locate you so we may verify your location, provide directions to our nearest Little Caesars, coordinate the preparation of your order based on your distance from a Little Caesars, deliver you relevant content based on your location, as well as monitor via the Service the efficiency of the services we provide to you.  Upon downloading the App, we provide location-based services to your approximate and/or exact location information.  Geo-fencing utilizes GPS and RFID signals to create a virtual boundary around a geographic area of our choosing, thereby allowing us to determine when you are in proximity to a Little Caesars.  In addition to traditional GPS location-based services, some of the retailers and others we work with may install low power Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, radio transmitters, or other devices in physical locations, which emit a signal that the App can detect to pinpoint your location or otherwise interact with the App (“ **iBeacons** ”).  Because iBeacons are more precise than GPS, we can improve the Services and send you more specific and relevant messages and offers.  In addition, we can track the efficiency of the service you receive from Little Caesars, by knowing when you enter or exit a Little Caesars or when you arrive in the parking lot for a carryout order.  You should consider the pros and cons involved in disclosing your location information to us and to other people.  Your Device settings may enable you to disable, change or limit some of these activities (See **Section 6** form more information).   



There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Service.

**Tracking Technologies Choices and Consent.**

**  
** We are giving you detailed notice of the Tracking Technologies and your limited choices regarding them so that your consent is meaningfully informed.  We may also provide you with a choice as to the level of data you share with us.  The Service may be limited and some features may not be available based on what data you elect and/or consent to share with us.   For more information on how to exercise preferences as to our features, functionality and communications, see **Section 6** , for choices regarding our service providers see **Section 3(b),** and for options regarding advertising and advertisers see **Section 6(d). **

  
Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings.  Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard.  Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies or other Tracking Technologies.  For information on disabling Flash cookies go to Adobe’s website <http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html>.  Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies some parts of our Services may not work and that when you revisit our Services your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations. 

Tracking Technologies in connection with App usage outside of a browser can only be disabled by uninstalling the App.  To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset manufacturer. 

For information on third party Tracking Technologies and browser Do Not Track signals, see the next section.

**Third Party Tracking and Do Not Track.  **

Third parties may use Tracking Technologies in connection with our Service.  They may do so to enable the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services. We may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for them.  However, you consent to potentially encountering third party Tracking Technologies in connection with use of our Service and accept that our statements under this Privacy Policy regarding our practices do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties.  For more information on our vendors, and their Tracking Technologies, **click here**

Also, various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services. Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms.  However, some of our vendors may.  For more information on their practices, **click here **

**c. Information Third Parties Provide About You.**

We may receive information about you from your friends and others that use the Service, when they submit content to us or post or interact with the Service.  Additionally, we may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Service with outside records from third parties.  To the extent we combine information we receive from those sources with your Personal Information we collect on the Service, it will be treated as Personal Information and we will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless we have disclosed otherwise.  For persons outside of Canada, in no other circumstances do our statements under this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties. 

**d. Interactions with Third-Party Services.**

The Service has functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Service and a third-party web site or application.  The use of this functionality can involve the third-party operator providing Personal Information, to us.  You may have an option to use your Facebook, Google or other account provided by a third-party site or application to interact with our Service. If we offer and you choose to use this functionality to access or use our Service, the third-party site or application may send Personal Information about you to us.  If so, we will then treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, since we are collecting it as a result of your accessing of and interaction on our Service.  In addition, we may provide third-party sites’ interfaces or links on the Service to facilitate your sending a communication from the Service. We may use third parties to facilitate emails, tweets or Facebook postings.  These third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties’ practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy.  LCE may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties.  Further, when you use third-party sites or services, you are using their services and not our services and they, not we, are responsible for their practices.  You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Service. 

**e. Information You Provide About a Third Party.**

The Service may allow you to send someone else an invitation or other communication. If so, the information you provide is used to facilitate the communication and is not used by us for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. You must have the permission of your family member or friend to provide us with their personal information. You may only provide email addresses of friends with whom you have had direct voluntary two-way communications, and with whom it is reasonable to conclude you have a personal relationship considering shared interests, experiences, opinions and other relevant factors.  You may only provide email addresses of family members with whom you are related by marriage, a common-law partnership, or parent-child relationship, and with whom you have had direct voluntary two-way communication.  Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Service, your contact information, name or user name and message may be included in the communication sent to your addressee(s), and the communication will indicate it was sent at your request and on your behalf.  Some of these tools may be third-party tools subject to third-party privacy policies as further detailed in **Section 1(d) **and **Section 5**.

**3. How and When Do We Share Information with Third Parties?**

We may share your in-App game/activity-related information, your username, and your activities and scores, with other users of the Service or the public. We may share non-Personal Information, including aggregated user statistics, with third parties. For instance, if we de-identify data about you, it is not treated as Personal Information by us, and we may share it with others freely. We may share Personal Information and non-Personal Information related to your transactions with third parties in connection with, and for purposes related to, the transactions. For example, if you use the Service to make a purchase with one of our LCE-branded franchise store locations, we may share personal information related to your purchase with that location. We may share your Device Identifiers with third parties along with other Usage Information and data related to you and your activities, for the purposes set out in this Policy.  However, we do not share your Personal Information that we have collected directly from you on our Service with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes unless we have given you the ability to choose to consent or withhold consent to such sharing at the time you provide your Personal Information, in which case we will honor your choice.  We may share your Personal Information and other information with our franchise stores and vendors in connection with a consumer service inquiry or complaint for the purpose of responding.  In addition, we may share your Personal Information, and other information we have collected about you as disclosed at the time you provide your information and as described below or otherwise to the extent not prohibited by applicable law except to the extent set forth in this Privacy Policy. Any of these transfers may be of local or cross-border nature.  Without limitation, LCE may disclose your information as follows: 

**a. When You Request Information From or Provide Information to Third Parties.**

You may be presented with an option on our Service to receive certain information and/or marketing offers directly from third parties.  If you choose to do so, your Personal Information and other information may be collected by or disclosed to such third parties and all information you disclose will be subject to the third-party privacy policies and practices of such third parties.  In addition, third parties may store, collect or otherwise have access to your information when you interact with their Tracking Technologies, content, tools apps or ads on our Service or link to them from our Service.   Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest or other third-party tools can do this and by so interacting with such third party tools you consent to such third party practices.  So can third parties that we may link to, including [www.littlecaesarsstuff.com](http://www.littlecaesarsstuff.com/), [www.littlecaesarslistens.com](http://www.littlecaesarslistens.com/), and other third parties that operate LCE branded sites under license and contract. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of such third parties and, therefore, you should review such third-party privacy policies and practices of such third parties prior to requesting information from or otherwise interacting with them. 

**b. Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf.**

We use third-party vendors to perform certain services on behalf of us or the Service, hosting the Service, designing and/or operating the Service’s features, tracking the Service’s activities and analytics, and enabling us to send you special offers or perform other administrative services.  We may provide these vendors with access to Usage Information, Personal Information and other user data, to carry out the services they are performing for you or for us.  Third-party analytics and other service providers may set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to your Personal Information and other information about you. We are not responsible for those third party technologies or activities arising out of them.  However, some may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available **here** We are not responsible for the effectiveness of or compliance with any third party. Others may also offer you certain choices regarding their practices.  One way to determine this is to add the free Ghostery plug-in to your browser (www.ghostery.com), which according to Ghostery will display for you traditional, browser-based cookies associated with the web sites (but not mobile apps) you visit and privacy and opt-out policies and options of the parties operating those cookies.  We are not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this tool. 

**c. To Protect the Rights of LCE and Our Users.**

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we may also disclose your information if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary or appropriate to: (i) protect or defend the rights, safety or property of LCE or third parties and to enforce this Policy, our Terms of Service, and other applicable agreements and policies; or (ii) comply with legal and regulatory obligations and, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, law enforcement requests.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we have complete discretion in electing to make or not make such disclosures, and to contest or not contest requests for such disclosures, all without notice to you. 

**d. Affiliates and Business Transfer.**

We may share your Device Identifiers and Personal Information, Demographic Information, Usage Information and other information with our parent, subsidiaries and affiliates (“ **Affiliates** ”), except as specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy or at the point of collection.  We also reserve the right to disclose and transfer all such information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Service or applicable database; or (ii) in connection with a merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our interests and/or assets or other corporate change, and during the course of any due diligence process. 

**e. Co-Branded Areas.**

Certain areas of the Service can be provided to you in association with third parties (“ **Co-Branded Areas** ”).  Sponsors, co-promotional partners and other third parties may require you to disclose Personal Information to them on Co-Branded Areas.

**6. Can I Exercise Preferences?**

**a. Communications.**

You may cancel or modify our e-mail and other electronic marketing communications you receive from us by following the instructions contained within our promotional e-mails or other electronic communications.  This will not affect subsequent subscriptions and if your opt-out is limited to certain types of electronic communications the opt-out will be so limited.  Subsequent or different subscriptions will be unaffected.  Please note that we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your account or use of our Service, and administrative and service announcements.  These transactional account messages will be unaffected if you choose to opt-out from receiving our marketing communications.

**b. Features and Functionality.**

All of the App’s features and functionality, and its related data collection, can be terminated by uninstalling the App and you can use the App’s, the Service’s or the Device’s settings to set and change some settings and control some functions.  Where a user of the Services requests features or functionality that uses a third party service, the user’s options for managing sharing services are provided through that third party’s services.  We are not responsible for the acts, omissions or policies of such third parties.  For more information on our service providers see **Section 3(b),** and on third party services see **Section 5**.

**c. Interest-Based Advertising.**

Certain companies may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“ **DAA** ”) AdChoices Program and may display an Advertising Option Icon for Interest-based Ads that links to an opt-out tool which allows you to exercise certain choices regarding targeting.  You can learn more about the DAA AdChoices Program at <http://www.youradchoices.com/> and its opt-out program for mobile apps at <http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices>.  In addition, certain advertising networks and exchanges may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (“ **NAI** ”). NAI has developed a tool that allows consumers to opt out of certain Interest-based Ads delivered by NAI members' ad networks. To learn more about opting out of such targeted advertising or to use the NAI tool, see <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>.  Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Ads, you will continue to receive non-targeted ads.  Further, opting out of one or more NAI or DAA members only means that those selected members should no longer under the DAA / NAI rules deliver certain targeted ads to you. This will affect services provided by the applicable DAA / NAI members, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads from non-participating parties.  Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or web browser(s), or use a non-browser-based method of access, your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.  Mobile device opt-outs will not affect browser-based Interest-based Ads even on the same device, and you must opt-out separately for each device.  LCE is not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.  However, LCE supports the ad industry’s 2009 Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (<http://www.iab.net/media/file/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf>) and expect that ad networks LCE directly engages to serve you Interest-based Ads will do so as well, though LCE cannot guaranty their compliance.
