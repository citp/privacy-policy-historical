Little Tikes' policy is to respect and protect your privacy.  This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it.<br>
<br>
<b>YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
<br>
There are cases where we may ask you for personal information such as your name, email address and age.  For example, we may request personal information when you register for the BigTikesClubÔ or for other services, contests or benefits which require registration or subscription.  If you choose not to give the personal information we request, you can still visit most of the Little Tikes web site, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers and services.  Any personal information which is provided by a guest who is 13 years of age or older may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by Little Tikes, the Newell Rubbermaid® family of companies and our affiliates or non-affiliated third party companies that we have selected, unless you have opted out as provided below.

<br>
<b>YOU MAY OPT OUT</b><br>
<br>
To help you control of your personal information and our communications with you, we allow you to opt-out at any time from the following: (1) sharing of your personal information with Little Tikes and the Newell Rubbermaid family of companies; or (2) sharing of your personal information with third-party companies that offer a product or service that we think would be of interest to you.   If you object to the use of your personal information for any reason, you may request that we stop such use by submitting an e-mail request to consumer.service@littletikes.com.  Further, in case you wish to correct or update any of your personal information (for example a new email address), you can do this by contacting our web site's customer service at consumer.service@littletikes.com.<br>
<br>
<b>COLLECTION OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
<br>
The Little Tikes web site also may detect and use your IP address or domain name for internal traffic monitoring and capacity purposes.  No personal information is used, rather the aggregate patterns of usage of our guests may be tracked and analyzed to provide you with improved service and content.  In addition, we may share statistical or aggregated non-personal information about our guests with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties.   This data is used to customize Little Tikes web site content and advertising to deliver a better experience to our guests.<br>
<br>
<b>SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES</b><br>
<br>
Despite any opt-out election, Little Tikes reserves the right to disclose guest information in special cases, when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be (either intentionally or unintentionally) causing injury to or interference with the rights or property of Little Tikes, other Little Tikes web site guests, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.  Little Tikes may disclose guest information in response to a subpoena or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.<br>
<br>
<b>OUR POLICY REGARDING CHILDREN</b><br>
<br>
We encourage parents and guardians to monitor and participate in their children's online activities.  No information should be submitted to this site by guests under 18 years of age, and guests under 18 years old are not allowed to register for our contests, clubs or activities.<br>
<br>
Little Tikes does not knowingly collect information from our guests under 13 years of age or provide any personally identifying information from such guests to any third party for any reason whatsoever.  We do not allow guests known to be under 13 years of age to receive direct marketing communications from Little Tikes or from third-parties.<br>
<br>
<b>OUR USE OF COOKIES</b>
This site may use "cookies" to store guest names and passwords to allow the web site to recognize you upon logging onto the Little Tikes web site.  Further, cookies may be used in providing additional features and benefits to you in the future.  If for any reason you may wish to not take advantage of cookies, you may have your browser not accept them, although this may disable or render unusable many of the features of our web site.<br>
<br>
<b>YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS</b><br>
<br>
By using this site, you signify your assent to the Little Tikes Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our site.  Your continued use of the Little Tikes web site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.<br>
