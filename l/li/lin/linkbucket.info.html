<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<div class="body">
<p>Link Bucket is founded on the principles of helping people to discover  new information by enabling them to share what they find interesting  with one another. Link Bucket knows that you care about how your personal  information is used and shared, and we take your privacy very seriously.  Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By  visiting the Link Bucket website, you are accepting the practices outlined in  this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers Link Bucket's treatment of personal information  that Link Bucket gathers when you are on the Link Bucket website and when you use Link Bucket  services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties  that Link Bucket does not own or control, or to individuals that Link Bucket does not  employ or manage.</p>
<h3>Information Collected by Link Bucket</h3>
<p>We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose  of our website, which is to enable users to discover and share  information with one another. This information allows us to provide you  with a customized and efficient experience. We do not process this  information in a way that is incompatible with this objective. We  collect the following types of information from our Link Bucket users:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Information You Provide to Us: </b><br> We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide  to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain  information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of  our special features.
<p>Registration: In order for you to use Link Bucket services, such as  submitting new links to the website, you must complete a registration  form. As part of this registration form, we require select personal  information (including your full name, city, state and e-mail address).</p>
<p>User Profile: To allow you to express yourself beyond just the  information collected during registration, we enable you to provide  additional information, such as a bio, favorite URLs, and instant  messaging IDs. In addition, you may choose to include photos of yourself  in your profile. As indicated below, in the section titled "Sharing  Your Information", you can control how your information is displayed and  used.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Automatic Information: </b><br> We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact  with us. Link Bucket and its authorized agents automatically receive and record  certain "traffic data" on their server logs from your browser including  your IP address, Link Bucket cookie information, and the page you requested. Link Bucket uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers,  analyze trends and administer the website.
<p>Link Bucket may collect and, on any page, display the total counts that page has been viewed. This includes User Profile pages.</p>
<p>Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites  anonymously. While Link Bucket will not be able to provide you with a  personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be  aware that these programs are available.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>E-mail Communications</h3>
<p>Link Bucket is very concerned about your privacy and we will never provide  your email address to a third party without your explicit permission, as  detailed in the "Sharing Your Information" section below. Link Bucket may send  out e-mails with Link Bucket-related news, products, offers, surveys or  promotions. You may also receive notification e-mails from Link Bucket, which  inform you of actions (e.g. friend requests) that have been performed on  the site. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, please visit  the Email Preferences section of your User Profile and/or follow the  instructions contained in the unwanted e-mail message. However, please  note that in all cases you will continue to receive all system e-mails  (e.g. those regarding forgotten user passwords) and legal notices (e.g.  updates to our policies) from us.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your  computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to  recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are  visited and by how many people. Link Bucket cookies do not collect personal  information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies  with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your  screen name or e-mail address is.</li>
<li>The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will  direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies,  how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or  how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies  activated because cookies allow you to use some of Link Bucket's coolest  features.</li>
<li>Some of our business partners, like our advertisers, may use cookies  on our website. We have no access to, or control over, these cookies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sharing Your Information</h3>
<p>Because Link Bucket enables people to discover and share information with  one another, information about the people who use Link Bucket is an integral  part of the Link Bucket experience. Rest assured that we neither rent nor sell  your personal information to anyone and that we will share your personal  information only as described below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Link Bucket Personnel: Link Bucket personnel and authorized consultants and/or  contractors may have access to user information if necessary in the  normal course of Link Bucket business.</li>
<li>Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell  assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically  one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Link Bucket, or  substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would  be one of the assets that is transferred.</li>
<li>Protection of Link Bucket and Others: We may release personal information  when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a  law; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other policies; or to  protect the rights, property, or safety of Link Bucket, our employees, our  users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other  companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk  reduction.</li>
<li>User Profile information: Information collected during registration  and subsequent visits, such as your full name and location, may be  displayed to other Link Bucket users in your User Profile. The User Profile is  the area on Link Bucket where we allow you to tell other Link Bucket users about  yourself and your interests. You may control what personal information  is displayed in your User Profile by visiting the Privacy Settings  section of your User Profile.</li>
<li>Member Directory: The e-mail address that you submit upon  registration will be searchable by other Link Bucket users who know you by your  email address, unless you choose to opt out of this feature. This is  primarily so that other users can find you to establish friendship  through Link Bucket. You may opt-out of this feature by visiting the Privacy  Settings section of your User Profile.</li>
<li>Social sharing of data: Link Bucket allows other users to browse stories  that you may find, submitted or commented on. This information is made  available publicly via your User Profile, on Link Bucket. Link Bucket may choose to post  this data on other site features.</li>
<li>Friends' Activity: Much like other online social networks, Link Bucket allows non-friends to browse your friends' activity ( <a href="http://digg.com/users/aubs/friends" mce_href="http://digg.com/users/aubs/friends" title="http://digg.com/users/aubs/friends">http://www.linkbucket.info/forum</a>).</li>
<li>API: Link Bucket will allow third parties access to all Link Bucket data this is  already publicly available through the Link Bucket website. Link Bucket will keep  private any passwords.</li>
<li>Syndication: Link Bucket allows for the RSS syndication of all of its public content within the Link Bucket website.</li>
<li>With Your Consent: Except as noted above, we will contact you when  your personal information is shared with third parties or used for a  purpose incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally  collected, and you will be able to opt out to prevent the sharing of  this information.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keeping Information Secure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your Link Bucket account information is protected by a password for your  privacy and security. Protect against unauthorized access to your  password and to your computer by logging off once you have finished  using a shared computer.</li>
<li>Only employees who need personal information to perform a specific  job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access  to it. All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and  security practices.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ways to Control Display and Use of Your Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose  information, but then you may be unable to use certain features on our  website, such as posting new links.</li>
<li>By visiting your User Profile, you can correct, amend, add or delete  personal information on our website. When you update information,  however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our  records.</li>
<li>You may request deletion of your Link Bucket account by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:&#10; &lt;script language='JavaScript' type='text/javascript'&gt;&#10; &lt;!--&#10; var prefix = 'mailto:';&#10; var suffix = '';&#10; var attribs = '';&#10; var path = 'hr' + 'ef' + '=';&#10; var addy58018 = 'mail' + '@';&#10; addy58018 = addy58018 + 'linkbucket' + '.' + 'info';&#10; document.write( '&lt;a ' + path + '\'' + prefix + addy58018 + suffix + '\'' + attribs + '&gt;' );&#10; document.write( addy58018 );&#10; document.write( '&lt;\/a&gt;' );&#10; //--&gt;&#10; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;script language='JavaScript' type='text/javascript'&gt;&#10; &lt;!--&#10; document.write( '&lt;span style=\'display: none;\'&gt;' );&#10; //--&gt;&#10; &lt;/script&gt;This e-mail address is being protected from spambots.
