Lgs. N. 196, June 30, 2003 (Personal Data Protection Code). The above mentioned legislation regulates the protection of persons and other parties with reference to personal data. Personal data are treated in accordance with the current legislation.<br><b>A.2) Nature of the bestowal</b><br>Data bestowal has a relevant nature, as it deals with information the knowledge of which is suitable for the hereafter indicated purposes. Furthermore, L’INDE informs you that failure or wrong communication of compulsory data may prevent the Holder from ensuring the congruity of the treatment and may also lead to a suspension of L’INDE responsibility with reference to the consequences of such untruthfulness. <br><b>A.3) Data treatment purposes</b><br>Personal data are collected and handled by L’INDE for purposes connected with the use and related services offered by the web-site and with the products purchase via lindelepalais.com, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>we collect personal data with reference to the subscribing process that is necessary to allow access to the reserved areas of lindelepalais.com and the forwarding of the news via e-mail, when requested.;</li>
<li>With reference to customer care, we collect personal data in order to provide all the necessary information about lindelepalais.com services and products purchasing.</li>
<li>With regard to the purchasing process at lindelepalais.com we collect data through the order form.</li>
<li>We collect data in order to provide technical assistance concerning internet navigation, browser compatibility and lindelepalais.com loading and display</li>

Furthermore, data will be forwarded to the Police or to the Judicial Authority, according to the current legislation and upon formal request (for example within anti-fraud services of lindelepalais.com).<br>L’INDE handles your data for direct marketing purposes with your express consent only. <br>In some cases L’INDE might be treating personal data of third parties involved in the purchasing process: this occurs, for instance, when the subscriber buys an item to be dispatched to a friend, that is when the paying subject differs from the product receiver. This also happens when the subscriber intends to indicate the services (or a specific offer) provided by lindelepalais.com to a friend .<br>In such cases, the customer is obliged to obtain the express consent from the person to whom data are referred and to inform him about the present Privacy Policy. The customer is the sole responsible for the disclosure of data and information of third parties without their express consent, or for illegal purposes. We inform you that the consent of such third parties is not necessary when their data are communicated to L’INDE for completing the contract with the company .<br><b>A4) Data treatment modalities</b><br>Data treatment is carried out through paper or electronic format or any other means present and future, with particular reference to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entrustment of elaboration operations to third parties</li>

Thus, L’INDE acquires the faculty of using data, also for commercial purposes and with reference to data banks in which information might be included, or for any other use.<br><b>A5) Communication</b> <br>Data are stored at the Handler’s offices, and will be communicated to the competent subjects for the implementation of the necessary operations, in order to guarantee a proper management of the business relationship and the safeguard of the user’s rights.<br>Data are handled by staff , collaborators, and by the service company of L’INDE. <br>Data might be disclosed without restrictions- especially in a exemplifying way- to third parties:</p>
