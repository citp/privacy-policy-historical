With our policy of using in-country linguists to support quality of translations and global hubs to support 24x7 delivery, we often perform data transfers outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA") when these teams access our systems hosted in Europe.

We will only conduct these data transfers where the service provision and time-zone of the language your request requires it to processed by a local third-party linguist or Lingo24 subsidiary hub.

Where we transfer personal data outside of the EEA, we ensure the party has taken such measures as are necessary to ensure the transfer is in compliance with relevant Data Protection Legislation.

### Your rights

The personal data we hold on you is your data. This means you have certain rights that you are able to exercise on our processing of it.

For marketing communications, you can ask us not to send you these at any time – just follow the unsubscribe instructions contained in the marketing communication, or raise a Consent Withdrawal Request at http://security.lingo24.com

You also have additional rights including to :

• Know what personal data we hold about you

• Request a copy of your personal data

• Ask us to restrict processing your personal data and/or delete it

You can exercise these rights at any time by raising a request at [http://security.lingo24.com](http://security.lingo24.com/).  We will review and investigate any request you make, and try to get back to you within a reasonable time frame.

This policy is subject to change without prior written notice.
