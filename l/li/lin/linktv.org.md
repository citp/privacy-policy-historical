# Link TV - Privacy and Security

**OUR PRIVACY STATEMENT**  


Link TV regards your online privacy as an important and serious matter. We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to this issue. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the LinkTV web site.

As Link TV continues to develop, we may add new features, change the type of information we gather or the method by which it is gathered. We will adjust this privacy policy to reflect any future changes, and notify users of any personal information we are requesting. Please contact us if you have any questions. 

**IP Addresses**

We will not use IP addresses when recording any feedback or polling you might offer. An IP address is a number assigned to the computer that is requesting a Web page from our site. Usually it is not your personal computer, but a computer used by your Internet service provider or company network. LinkTV uses IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, and to report aggregate information.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. The only instances when LinkTV might use cookies is in connection with our daily poll, to insure pop-up information screens display no more than once per day, to help users manage their participation in our chat rooms and to give users control over their browsing experience on the Link TV site. For the polling application, the cookie prevents multiple votes from the same system so we can gauge polls as accurately as possible. For the chat rooms, the cookie remembers the user's handle only. The cookie automatically expires within 24 hours for both the polling applications and pop-up screen control. We do not use cookies to capture personal information, ever. Some of our partners or sponsors may use cookies on their Web sites. Please check the privacy statement of each Web site you visit to determine their usage of cookies. 

**Privacy: Feedback, Surveys, Contests**

Link TV offers the opportunity for visitors to request email bulletins, partake in surveys and contests or offer feedback. Some of these forms require contact information or demographic information. Your contact information is only used as you have requested. We do not use this information to send marketing material to you nor will we pass your private information on to third parties. Any information reported to underwriters or partners is on an aggregate, not an individual, basis. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings. Please see the Choice/Opt-Out section below. 

**E-commerce, Donations and Order Forms**

Our site will use an order form when customers purchase merchandise from us or make donations. We collect customers' contact information (like their email address) and financial information (like credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to get in touch with the customer when necessary. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for the merchandise or donation. Contact information and financial information are kept private and are used for no other purpose than what is indicated above. 

Any financial information provided by users is sent via a secure server and encrypted for user protection. Link TV does not store or retain credit card numbers after a purchase has been completed. Link TV uses the industry standard SSL security protocol to encrypt all information you submit. This protocol ensures that sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, addresses, phone numbers, etc. cannot be read or intercepted in transit. Link TV encourages all users to upgrade to 128-bit encryption to ensure privacy on financial transactions. 

**Third Party Advertising and Content**

In the future, we may display some ads of our sponsors on our site. Link TV has partnerships with other companies and links to other Web sites. Link TV is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
