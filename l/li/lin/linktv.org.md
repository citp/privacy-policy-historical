# Link TV - Privacy and Security

**OUR PRIVACY STATEMENT**  


Link TV regards your online privacy as an important and serious matter. We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to this issue. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the LinkTV web site.

As Link TV continues to develop, we may add new features, change the type of information we gather or the method by which it is gathered. We will adjust this privacy policy to reflect any future changes, and notify users of any personal information we are requesting. Please contact us if you have any questions. 

**IP Addresses**

We will not use IP addresses when recording any feedback or polling you might offer. An IP address is a number assigned to the computer that is requesting a Web page from our site. Usually it is not your personal computer, but a computer used by your Internet service provider or company network. LinkTV uses IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, and to report aggregate information.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Link TV uses cookies in several instances: to log registration for viewing archived streamed episodes of _Mosaic: World News from the Middle East_ ; to record user-set streaming downloading speed preferences; to record user-set network schedule time zone preferences; and to anonymously record aggregated visitor web page usage patterns. We do not use cookies to capture personal information, ever. Some of our partners or sponsors may use cookies on their web sites. Please check the privacy statement of each site you visit to determine their usage of cookies. 

**Privacy: Feedback, Surveys, Contests**

Any financial information provided by users is sent via a secure server and encrypted for user protection. Link TV does not store or retain credit card numbers after a purchase has been completed.
