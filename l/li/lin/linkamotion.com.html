<h3>Please Fully Read The Linkamotion Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Linkamotion strives to offer its members the many advantages  of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized  experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name,  e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms  of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email  address to any unauthorized third party. Period.</p>
<h3>How we gather information from users</h3>
<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are    visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the    services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information    when you register for access to certain portions of our site or  request   certain features, such as membership or when you make a  purchase. You   may provide information when you participate in   contests and other  interactive areas of   our site. Like most Web sites, Linkamotion  also collects information   automatically and through the use of  electronic tools that may be   transparent to our visitors and members. For example,  we may log the name of your   Internet Service Provider or use cookie  technology to recognize you and   hold information from your visit.  Among other things, the cookie may   store your user name and password,  sparing you from having to re-enter   that information each time you  visit, or may control the number of times   you encounter a particular  advertisement while visiting our site.  As  we  adopt additional  technology, we may also gather information through   other means. In  certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with   information, for  example by setting your browser to refuse to accept   cookies, but if  you do you may be unable to access certain portions of   the site or may  be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we   may not be  able to customize the site’s features according to your   preferences.</p>
<h3>What we do with the information we collect</h3>
<p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your    visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We    respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify    you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine  information   about your usage patterns with similar information  obtained from other   users to help enhance our site and services (e.g.,  to learn which  pages  are visited most or what features are most  attractive).    Aggregated  Information may occasionally be shared with  our advertisers  and business  partners. Again, this information does  not include any  Personally  Identifiable Information about you or allow  anyone to  identify you  individually.</p>
<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected from your Linkamotion membership to communicate with you about your  registration  and  customization preferences; our Terms of Service and  privacy  policy;  services and products offered by Linkamotion.com and other  topics we  think you might find  of interest.</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by Linkamotion.com  may  also be used for other purposes,  including but not limited to site   administration, troubleshooting,  processing of e-commerce  transactions,  administration of sweepstakes  and contests, and other  communications  with you. Certain third parties  who provide technical  support for the  operation of our site (our Web  hosting service for  example) may access  such information. We will use  your information  only as permitted by law.  In addition, from time to  time as we  continue to develop our business,  we may sell, buy, merge or  partner  with other companies or businesses.  In such transactions, user   information may be among the transferred  assets. We may also disclose   your information in response to a court  order, at other times when we   believe we are reasonably required to do  so by law, in connection with   the collection of amounts you may owe to  us, and/or to law enforcement   authorities whenever we deem it  appropriate or necessary. Please note   we may not provide you with notice  prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
<h3>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</h3>
<p>Linkamotion expects its partners, advertisers and  affiliates  to  respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that  third  parties,  including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and  other  content  providers accessible through our site, may have their own   privacy and  data collection policies and practices. For example,   during your visit  to our site you may link to, or view as part of a   frame on another site, certain content that is actually  created or   hosted by a third party. Also, through Linkamotion.com you  may be   introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites,  features,   contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. Linkamotion.com is  not  responsible for the actions or policies of such  third parties.  You  should check the applicable privacy policies of  those third  parties when  providing information on a feature or page  operated by a  third party.</p>
<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other    third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify    some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For    example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may    include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have    seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available on   our  site may offer services operated by third parties and may use   cookies  or other technology to gather information. Linkamotion.com  does  not  control the use of this technology by third parties or the   resulting  information, and is not responsible for any actions or   policies of such  third parties.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally    Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that    information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by    third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited    messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are    beyond the control of Linkamotion.com and this policy.</p>
<h3>Children</h3>
<p>Linkamotion.com does not knowingly collect or solicit  Personally   Identifiable Information from or about children under 13  except as   permitted by law. If we discover we have received any  information from a   child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will  delete that   information immediately. If you believe Linkamotion.com has  any   information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the    address listed below.  Although this situation is very unlikely please contact us ASAP if this situation has occurred.</p>
<h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>
<p>Linkamotion.com reserves the right to change this policy at  any  time.  Please check this page periodically for changes. Your  continued  use of  our site following the posting of changes to these  terms will  mean you  accept those changes. Information collected prior  to the time  any change  is posted will be used according to the rules  and laws  that applied at  the time the information was collected.</p>
<p>Should you have any questions or comments you can contact us as support@Linkamotion.com</p>
<p>Thanks for using and visiting Linkamotion.com</p>
