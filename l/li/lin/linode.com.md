# Privacy Policy - Linode

The following Privacy Policy will apply to the use of any Linode service beginning on May 25, 2018, though you are invited to review and accept its terms at any time before such date. 

Linode LLC ("Linode," "we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the Personal Data it collects. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you of how we protect your privacy when accessing or using Linode Resources. 

This Privacy Policy applies to Linode Resources that link to, or reference, this Privacy Policy, and describes the ways Linode collects and uses your personal information and the choices you have regarding collection, use, maintenance, access and transmission of your personal information. Capitalized terms not expressly defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning found in the Customer Agreement. By utilizing a Linode Resource, including without limitation the Linode Services, Linode's website or otherwise providing your Personal Data to Linode via any other means, you or the entity you represent ("you" or "your") accept and consent to the rights, obligations and practices described in this Privacy Policy. 

  1. Who does the Privacy Policy apply to? 

This Privacy Policy applies to all Customers of, and Visitors to, any Linode Resource or Linode Service. In the case of Customers, the Account Holder shall be responsible for (i) informing their End Users, if any, of the existence of this Privacy Policy, as well as any amendments, updates or modifications made to this Privacy Policy and (ii) agreeing to this Privacy Policy, as amended, updated or modified from time to time, on behalf of his, her or its End Users. 

  2. What Personal Data is Collected by Linode? 

Linode considers any information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify you to be Personal Data, including without limitation, Personal Data that is accessed, collected, maintained, transmitted and/or used by Linode in the normal course of our business, and is subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy and applicable law. 

  3. How is Personal Data Collected by Linode? 

Linode collects and logs your IP address, the time and duration of your visit, the time and duration of the pages on Linode's website that you view (where applicable) and information about your computer system, such as your browser type and operating system, whenever a Linode Resource is accessed or used by you. In the case of Customers, we collect, maintain, transmit and/or use Personal Data provided by you in your Account, including without limitation, your full name, Linode identification number, billing data and contact information. 

Linode also collects anonymous usage information on Visitors to its website through use of [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/). Google Analytics may employ third party tracking cookies to gather anonymous browser, operating system, geographic, and website navigation information. Use of the Linode Manager interface requires the acceptance of cookies for login session management purposes. 

Linode will likely place a cookie on your hard drive during the web visit. A cookie is a unique alphanumeric identifier that Linode uses to determine the number of unique Visitors that view its website, whether or not those Visitors are repeat Visitors, and the source of the visits. Cookies cannot be executed as code or used to deliver a virus. Other servers cannot read cookies and personal information cannot be gathered from cookies. Cookies are simply an identifier shared between you and Linode to allow Linode to improve the services Linode offers to you through its website. If you do not wish cookies to be placed on your computer, then they can be disabled in your web browser. The option to do so is normally found in your browser's "security settings" section. However, please note, permanently disabling cookies in your browser may hinder your use of Linode's website as well as other website and interactive services. 

A web beacon, also known as a web bug, is a small graphic (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel), that is embedded in a web advertisement, email, or page on Linode's website, which is invisible to you. When you view a page on Linode's website, an e-mail or an advertisement, your web browser will request the web beacon from a web server, which in turn will set a cookie in your web browser containing a unique identifier. This unique identifier will be linked to log information that is used to track your usage of Linode's website in order to determine the effectiveness of content and advertising campaigns. 

Linode does not collect personal information about you as part of a web visit, but web visit information may be tied to other information (including personal information) that Linode collects from you via chat, web forms, and the other means Linode describes in this Privacy Policy.
