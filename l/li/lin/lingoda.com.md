Certain materials and functionalities of Easy Languages Site are available only through the purchase of an "Easy Languages class package" or “Easy Deutsch class package”. Pursuant to this Agreement you are responsible for any charges associated with connecting to the Site. Easy Languages reserves the right to change the class package fees in effect or institute new fees at any time, upon reasonable notice posted on the site and emailed to current customers. 

By purchasing a class package to the Easy Languages service you agree to be bound to the following terms: 

### Billing Policies

Easy Languages fees are exclusive of any applicable VAT or taxes, interest or installment fees charged by the credit card company, or other fees associated with connecting to the Internet. 

Easy Languages guarantees that every credit card transaction you make at Easy Languages is 100% secure. If at any time you wish to check on the status of your subscription, please login and visit the “My Account” page in your Login area. 

You can always find current class package prices posted in the checkout pages and occasionally in other pages of our website. Your paid class package to Easy Languages gives you access to the stated amount of classes (“class credit”). One class lasts 60 minutes. The exact contents of your paid class package and the features to which you do and do not have access is clearly set forth and accessible at all times in the logged-in section of the Site under “My account”. 

Your class package contains teacher-led classes, whether group or private, those sessions are delivered on a “class credit basis” over a period of 6 months, this means that if you haven’t used those sessions by the end of 6 months after purchasing the class package, those unused sessions are lost to you and will not be refunded. 

All class package fees are recurring and non-refundable after your purchase. This means that if you purchase a package of classes, you agree to the automatic purchase of another package of the same number of classes after you have taken all of these classes. If you do not wish to automatically purchase another package, you have to deactivate your purchase in the “My Account” page in your login area or give us written notice before your Class Credit has reached 0. Once purchased, classes cannot be refunded. 

### Free trial

The free trial is available only to first-time users. 

### Credit card payments

You can choose to purchase different options of class packages, for example packages of 4, 10, or 20 classes. If a package is not canceled in the “Account” section in the login area, you will automatically be charged for another package of the same size after your class credit is depleted. 

After initial enrollment, if your credit card expires, is cancelled, is lost, or rendered invalid, your subscription is in danger of termination. You will be contacted and given the opportunity to change your registration data. If your credit card is not successfully recharged and you are not renewed successfully, your subscription will be terminated. 

###### 11\. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Easy Languages and its affiliates, partners, suppliers, and employees from any and all liability, claims, costs, or damages arising from your use of the Site or your breach of this Agreement and any of the Terms set out herein. 

###### 12\. Miscellaneous

If any portion of this Agreement is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, this Agreement as a whole shall not be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, but only that portion of this Agreement that is unlawful, void or unenforceable shall be stricken from this Agreement. 

You agree that if Easy Languages does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Agreement (or which Easy Languages has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Easy Languages’ rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Easy Languages. 

All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made in this Agreement shall survive your acceptance of this Agreement and the termination of this Agreement. 

This Agreement represents the entire understanding and agreement between you and Easy Languages regarding the subject matter of the same, and supersedes all other previous agreements.

The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

If you ever discover a fraudulent charge from Easy Languages on your billing statement, please contact us and you must report it immediately to your credit card provider, in accordance with their standard procedures. 

This site makes use of forums, bulletin boards and chat rooms. Please remember that any information you disclose in these areas becomes public. You should always be cautious about the amount of personal information you give to anyone in this context.

The only information we share with other companies within the Easy Languages group of companies is your name, age group, email address, and country.

  * to any other third party with your prior consent to do so. 



###### 9\. Cookies

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that we store on your computer's browser or hard drive. We and our partners use cookies to remember personal information when you visit our website. For example, if you choose the view our site in French we will store that information in your cookie so we can show you our site in French the next time you visit. We also use them to store your login ID to make it easier for you to login to our site. Most browsers allow you the option of preventing cookies from being stored on your computer, though doing so will cause you to lose many of the benefits of Easy Languages. 

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. 

We use the service of a third party tracking utility company to track the behavior of visitors to our site. However, we do not have access to or control over their cookies. The information we collect through our third party tracking utility company is completely anonymous and is used to improve our services and marketing efforts. 

As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. 

###### 10\. Web Beacons

We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. 

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. 

In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Easy Languages website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages. 

###### 11\. Quizes and Contests

We may provide you the opportunity to participate in quizzes or contests on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these quizzes and contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and email address), and demographic information (such as zip code). 

We may use this information to personalize our communications to you and to suggest more relevant products and services. 

###### 12\. Public Forums

Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums.You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. 

###### 13\. Links to other websites

This site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Easy Languages is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of any website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by the Easy Languages website. 

###### 14\. Testimonials

We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information. We do obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. If you wish to request to have your testimonial removed you contact our Customer Service. 

###### 15\. Refer a friend

If you decide to refer a friend to our site as part of Easy Languages contests or other promotions, we ask you for the friend's email address and give you the option of sending them a personal message. Easy Languages will then send a one-time, automatically generated email message inviting your friend to visit our site. Easy Languages stores the email address in your personal file solely for the purpose of crediting you if your friend becomes a member. Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database. 

We also utilize an import contacts feature to help you keep in touch with your contacts and other members. We make it easy for you to invite people from your email address books to join you on our Site. At your request we will search your email address book to help you import your contacts to our site. When we do this, we do not store any of your contacts' information our our servers. We may send an email on your behalf to your contacts, but we do not keep their email address or any other information until they register for our site themselves. 

The Easy Languages privacy policy is subject to change. If we decide to change the way we collect, use or share information, we will take commercially reasonable steps to notify members by way of an email that explains the changes and gives them the choice as to whether or not we may use their information in the new manner. If you have any questions about this policy statement, or about any of Easy Language's other policies and practices, please contact us.
