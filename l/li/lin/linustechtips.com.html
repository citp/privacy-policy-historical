</h2>

<p dir="ltr">
	This Privacy Policy covers how Linus Media Group Inc (“we” or “us”) collects information when you interact with websites, apps or other products (collectively, the “services”) that we operate, except those Services which provide a separate Privacy Policy.

		<strong>Information provided to create your account</strong>, including your email address and username, is required to be able to provide you with the services associated with an account. For example, we require an email address so that we can send password reset emails.<br>
		This information may be shared with third parties when you register your account to check it against a database of known spammers; if your account later posts spam we may share this with the third party so that they can update their database.<br>
		If you give us consent to do so, we may also use your email address to send marketing emails, such as notifying you of a new service or YouTube channel.<br class="kix-line-break">
		You can update your username and email address in your <a href="https://linustechtips.com/main/settings/" rel="">account settings</a>.

			<strong>Information that you submit while using the services</strong>, such as forum posts, profile information, attachments and personal messages are displayed on the site. All information that you submit, except personal messages or where explicitly stated, may be publicly displayed on the site, and will be associated with your username. As the information is displayed publicly, we cannot control what third parties do with the information. In particular, you must only submit personal information if you accept that it may become permanently shared with the public.<br>
			Personal messages are visible to the participants of the conversation. They may also be accessed by a Staff Member if they have a reason to do so, such as if the post is reported by one of the participants.<br>
			You can edit content that you have submitted by clicking the edit button associated with that content. We would prefer that content is not deleted, so that it can help other people in future, but if you would like your own content deleted you can request it by clicking the report button associated with that content.
