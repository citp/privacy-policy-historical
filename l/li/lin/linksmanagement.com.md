# Privacy Policy - LinksManagement

_Revised: May 2018_

On 25 May 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaces the existing 1995 EU Data Protection Directive (European Directive 95/46/EC).

LinksManagement is committed to GDPR compliance across the company, and we have already implemented and evaluated the latest requirements and limitations enforced by the GDPR. We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected in an orderly manner. Thereupon we’ve carefully reviewed the way we collect, use, keep and dispose of your data with the aim of provision of online advertising, SEO or any other provided by us services.

In circumstances where we ask you to provide any kind of personal information in order to use any of our websites or services, all such information will only be used in accordance with this privacy policy.

Accepting this privacy policy, you confirm your personal data actuality and accuracy, and give consent to disclosing your personal data so we can provide services, close sales, run marketing campaign, and enable LinksManagement platform operation.

Modifications shall become effective immediately upon being posted at https://www.linksmanagement.com website. Your continued use of the service after amendments are posted constitutes an acknowledgement and acceptance of the terms, so please revise the Terms of Service, Acceptable Use Policy, and Privacy Policy periodically to follow the updates.
