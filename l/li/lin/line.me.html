Also, please note that, an advertising identifier may be associated with our internal identifier.</div><div><br></div><div><b>b.What Other Information Might LINE Collect?</b></div><div>To improve your experience when using the Service, we provide additional functionalities, including the ability to access your LINE account from multiple devices, help you find your friends, or help you enjoy the Service more. &nbsp;If you choose to use such functionalities or your LINE account on multiple devices, we may ask you to provide following types of information:</div><div><b>i.Email Address [OPTIONAL]</b></div><div>You may want to access your LINE account from multiple devices (“Multiple Device Login”) or to transfer your LINE account from one device to another (“Account Transfer”). &nbsp;If you wish to enable the Multiple Devices Login or to transfer your LINE account to a different device, you will need to provide your email address and a password and/or PIN code, so that we may associate these devices with your LINE account. We may use your registered e-mail address to provide you important information about the Service.</div><div>Please note that, if you change your mind later and decide you no longer wish to provide your email address, you can at any time remove it in “Settings” &gt; “Accounts” menu in the LINE App.</div><div><br></div><div><b>ii.LINE ID [OPTIONAL]</b></div><div>You may want to make it easier for your LINE friends to find you. &nbsp;If you so choose, you can assign a LINE ID to your LINE account, and allow your friends to find you through your LINE ID. &nbsp;Alternatively, you may choose not to allow other LINE users to contact you using your LINE ID. &nbsp;Please note that, your LINE ID is not visible to other LINE users, and it may be a pseudonym.</div><div><br></div><div><b>iii.Contact Telephone Numbers in Your Address Book [OPTIONAL]</b></div><div>You may wish to make it easier for you to find your friends so that you can communicate using LINE App. &nbsp;If you wish to ask us to help you find your friends, you may want to consider enabling “Auto Add Friends” feature. If you choose to enable “Auto Add Friends” feature, we will collect the telephone numbers (and e-mail addresses if issued by Japanese telecom companies) in your mobile device’s address book, and enable you add friends in the LINE App who have consented to being found by their telephone number or e-mail address (“Account Matching Service”). &nbsp;Once you have added a friend in the LINE App, you can call them or send them messages over the LINE App. &nbsp;We will collect information from only the telephone number (and e-mail addresses if issued by Japanese telecom companies) fields in your mobile device’s address book; we do not collect contact names or any information from other data fields. &nbsp;You can at any time change your mind and disable Account Matching Service by turning off this feature under “Settings” -&gt; “Friends” &nbsp;If you do so, the information you provided by this feature will be deleted.<br><br></div><div>If you would like to invite individual friends or contacts to connect with you on the LINE App, you may send them invitations directly via SMS or e-mail directly from your mobile device using the address book in your mobile phone. &nbsp;When you use the invitation function in the LINE App (“Tell a Friend Service”), we will access your address book to identify your friends. &nbsp;After your friend(s) have been identified, you can send invitations directly to individual friends and contact via SMS or e-mail on your mobile device telephone. &nbsp;LINE does not send invitations as part of the Tell a Friend Service.</div><div><br></div><div><b>iv.Location Information [OPTIONAL]</b></div><div>To use LINE App, you are not required to provide your location information (“geolocation”). &nbsp;However, we provide features that utilize geolocation for your convenience and to improve your user experience:</div><div>If you wish to add nearby LINE user(s), you may want to use the “Shake It!” feature, which allows you to add nearby user(s) by shaking your smartphone. &nbsp;You can start the process by choosing the feature under “Add Friends” menu, and start shaking your smartphone along with your nearby friends. &nbsp;Once the process is initiated, we will ask you to access your geolocation so that we can match you with the nearby LINE user(s). &nbsp;Please note that, you can only find users who also initiated the process. &nbsp;Users who do not initiate the “Shake It!” process cannot be found as we do not access their geolocation.</div><div>You may wish to receive information about nearby shops provided by “Official Account” in the LINE App. &nbsp;If you choose to receive information from an “Official Account” by pressing the button, we will obtain geolocation via your mobile phone so that we can provide information about shops nearby you.</div><div>In both cases, collection and use of your geolocation is one-time-only (ad hoc), meaning we delete the geolocation after we use and do not retain. Also, we do not aggregate your geolocation to create geolocation history.</div><div>In other cases where we collect or use your geolocation data in an additional separate service, we will make sure that we provide notice and/or obtain your consent.</div><div><br></div><div><b>v.Contact Information for Customer Support [OPTIONAL]</b></div><div>There may be occasions where you wish to contact us to seek customer support service. &nbsp;If you contact us via our Contact Form or by other means, we may obtain and maintain any information you choose to provide, including your name, contact info such as your email address, phone number, as well as information about your mobile device or personal commuter such as device type, and OS type. &nbsp;We will use this information to address and investigate the issues you have forwarded to us, to provide you support, and to improve our customer support service.</div><div><br></div><div><b>vi.Contact Information for Promotional Events and Customer Surveys [OPTIONAL]</b></div><div>If you choose to participate in promotional events or surveys that LINE offers from time to time, we might ask your contact details (e.g., name, mailing address, phone number, email address, gender and date of birth) to administer the event, such as to confirm participation eligibility for the event, to enable you to fill out a questionnaire, to conduct to deliver the prizes to you.</div><div><br></div><div><b>vii.Payment Information [OPTIONAL]</b></div><div>If you choose to purchase or use a fee-based service and pay for such service by means other than in-app purchases via iTunes or Google Play, we may collect your credit card information. &nbsp;We will use your credit card information only to process your purchase or use our fee-based service. &nbsp;Please note that, we will not retain your credit card information because your credit-card settlement will be handled by appropriate payment agencies.</div><div><br></div><div><div><b>viii.Information from websites and applications that have integrated our Service plugins [OPTIONAL]&nbsp;</b></div><div>Our websites/applications and/or third-party websites/applications may integrate our plugins such as "LINE it!" &nbsp;We may record your LINE login activity through the use of such plugins, or obtain the URL of the website that includes our plugins which you visit while you are logged into our Service via your browser. &nbsp;Please note that no information will be obtained from websites or applications with our plugins if you are logged out of the Service.</div></div><div><br></div><div><b>c.What About Information I Create About Myself and Share With Others?</b></div><div><b>i.User-Generated Content [OPTIONAL]</b></div><div>In addition to the information describe above, you may choose to create “user-generated content,” such as your profile information (i.e., “display name,” profile picture, and the phrase you choose to show under your “WHAT’S UP?” status), text and audio messages, photos, videos, geolocation information, or the contact information of your LINE friends, and share your user-generated content with other users. &nbsp;You may choose how much or little of your user-generated content you would like to share and with whom you share it when you create messages by selecting the recipients of your user-generated contents and/or by the settings in the LINE App.</div><div>Please remember that the user-generated content you share with others can be copied, stored, or disseminated by the recipients and accessed by unintended recipients due to the nature of digital data. &nbsp;We encourage you to pay close attention when you generate and share your information or contents.</div><div><br></div><div><b>4.How We Use and Handle Your Information</b></div><div><b>a.How Does LINE Use My Information?</b></div><div>To provide the Service, LINE, as a data controller or joint data controller, uses your information for the following purposes:</div><div>•to provide you the Service via your mobile phone or personal computer and to allow you to transmit your user-generated content to other LINE users;</div><div>•to verify your identity;</div><div>•to allow you to use your LINE account on multiple devices and transfer your LINE account to another device;</div><div>•to help you find people you know that already are LINE users so that you can connect using LINE;
