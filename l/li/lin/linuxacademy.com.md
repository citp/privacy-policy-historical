# Privacy Policy | Linux Academy

#### **Summary**

Linux Academy respects each individual's right to personal privacy.

#### **Security**

Linux Academy has implemented processes intended to protect user information and maintain security of data. Each account holder is assigned a password, which is required to access their account. It is your responsibility to protect the security of this login information. We have attempted to protect Linux Academy's servers by locating them in areas with security procedures, use of firewalls and implementing other generally available security technologies. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of data, but no guarantee can be made that your information and data will be secure from intrusions and unauthorized release to 3rd parties.

#### **Application Data**

As part of the Linux Academy services, we store the data you provide. We respect the privacy of all users, and consider all data that is collected to be private. Your information is used strictly for internal purposes, and Linux Academy will not distribute or sell your information to a 3rd party, except as disclosed in this statement. When you submit information, you are transferring such information into the United States and you hereby consent to such transfer.

#### **Account Information**

We collect email addresses from those who contact us via email, and ask for information such as your email address and name when you sign up for an account with Linux Academy. The information we collect is not distributed or sold to a 3rd party. It will only be used to communicate with you about your Linux Academy account, and where needed as part of certain Linux Academy features. You may update your account information at any time.

#### **Web Server Logs**

For statistical purposes, Linux Academy will gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. These log files contain standard information collected by web servers, such as client IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), operating system, etc. This information is only used internally, and is not distributed or sold to a 3rd party. Linux Academy uses this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Linux Academy website and app and to gather demographic information about its user base as a whole. Linux Academy does not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information.

However, any information collected by Linux Academy may be shared if it is necessary to investigate, prevent or prosecute illegal activities, suspected fraud, violations to the Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law or a valid government request (including, but not limited to, search warrants, subpoenas or court orders). Linux Academy may also share information if it is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Linux Academy will notify you before information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
