While children under the age of 13 can create/save tracks, and view Line Rider movies, they are not permitted to post in the forums. We ask for an email address during the registration process to guard against malicious computer programs which may try to sign up automatically. The email is deleted from our records immediately following the verification process. We will not use the email address to contact you or share with any third parties.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

inXile Entertainment does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 

We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with inXile Entertainment under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help inXile Entertainment communicate with you about offers from Line Rider and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. 

We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. 

We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of inXile Entertainment 's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 

We transfer information about you if inXile Entertainment is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, inXile Entertainment will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 

Line Rider displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. 

inXile Entertainment does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the advertisement.

inXile Entertainment lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer.

This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by inXile Entertainment.

**Third Party Advertising**

Advertisements that appear on Line Rider are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to users by third party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. inXile Entertainment does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on Line Rider unless you choose to share it with them.

This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by inXile Entertainment and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.

**Changing or Removing Information**

Access and control over most personal information on Line Rider is readily available through the profile editing tools. Line Rider users may modify or delete any of their profile information at any time by logging into their account. Information will be updated immediately. Individuals who wish to deactivate their Facebook account may do so by contacting us via email at [info@linerider.com](mailto:info@linerider.com)  . Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally available to members of Line Rider.

Where you make use of the communication features of the service to share information with other individuals on Line Rider, however, (e.g., sending a personal message to another Line Rider user) you generally cannot remove such communications.
