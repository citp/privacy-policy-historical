                            No other data or time commitment is required as a Member's resume is automatically converted into a LinkMe profile,
                            however we recommend that Members check the quality of the profile created.
                            If the Member does not have a resume the Member will need to manually submit information about their skills, education and employment history.

                            We may provide the name, email address, and professional profile of Members to Recruiters to allow Recruiters to assess the suitability of Members for employment opportunities.
                            We value user choice and therefore allow Members to change their preferences about what parts of their personal information can be accessed when Recruiters are doing searches in their account settings.

                            Your personal information may be provided to other users, including Members and Recruiters, who have accepted your invitation to communicate with them directly using the Site's communication facilities.
                            Many emails you initiate through the Site, for example an invitation sent to a non-user, will list your name in the subject line of the message.
                            Emails you initiate may also provide aggregate information about your network of contacts (for instance how many people are in your network), but will never list the names of the people to whom you are directly connected.
                            Other communications that you initiate through the Site, like a request for a contact, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal contact information.
                            Your contact information will only be shared with another user if you choose to disclose that information.

                            If you use one of the Site's public communication facilities, such as blogs or chat rooms, you should be aware that any information you submit there can be read, collected or used by other users and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.
                            We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these public forums.
