Privacy Policy
<br><br>
Linknami takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. The federal government and technology industry have developed practical tips to help you guard against Internet fraud, secure your computer and protect your personal information.
<br><br>
Linknami strives to keep all of our terms, including our privacy policy, to be as simple as possible. Linknami collects information to customize the content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you and for other reasons.

In order to sign up for a Linknami account and use the service, we require some simple information like a name, email address and/or account authorization via Facebook, Twitter, Google+, etc. When you enter this information, Linknami stores it so your account may persist, and to help us keep a record of your activites on the service.
<br><br>
Additionally, Linknami may request and collect financial information including tax ID or other information necessary to receive or render payment for advertising services or other services.
<br><br>
Information Provided From the Use of Our Service
<br><br>
Occasionally Linknami will collect certain kinds of information about how/when you use the service, like when you visit a link generated by the Linknami service, or post an ad to a social media account. This information includes:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Log Information - This can include details of how you used the service/arrived at the service, your IP address, and cookies which may uniquely identify your account or browser.</li>
<li>Device Information - In order to better serve our customers, Linknami occasionally collects data about the types of devices which access our service, including hardware models, operating system versions, unique device identification and mobile network information, including phone numbers.</li>

<br><br>
Linknami does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or when we respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. If Linknami becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
<br><br>
