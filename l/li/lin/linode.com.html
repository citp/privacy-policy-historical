				The following Privacy Policy will apply to the use of any Linode service
				beginning on May 25, 2018, though you are invited to review and accept its
				terms at any time before such date.
				</p>
				<p>
				Linode LLC ("Linode," "we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy and is
				committed to protecting the Personal Data it collects. The purpose of this
				Privacy Policy is to inform you of how we protect your privacy when accessing or
				using Linode Resources.
				</p>

				<p>
				This Privacy Policy applies to Linode Resources that link to, or reference, this
				Privacy Policy, and describes the ways Linode collects and uses your personal
				information and the choices you have regarding collection, use, maintenance,
				access and transmission of your personal information. Capitalized terms not
				expressly defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning found in the
				Customer Agreement. By utilizing a Linode Resource, including without limitation
				the Linode Services, Linode's website or otherwise providing your Personal Data
				to Linode via any other means, you or the entity you represent ("you" or "your")
				accept and consent to the rights, obligations and practices described in this
				Privacy Policy.
				</p>

				<ol class="legal">

				<li>Who does the Privacy Policy apply to?
				<p>
				This Privacy Policy applies to all Customers of, and Visitors to, any Linode
				Resource or Linode Service. In the case of Customers, the Account Holder shall
				be responsible for (i) informing their End Users, if any, of the existence of
				this Privacy Policy, as well as any amendments, updates or modifications made to
				this Privacy Policy and (ii)  agreeing to this Privacy Policy, as amended,
				updated or modified from time to time, on behalf of his, her or its End Users.
				</p>
				</li>

				<li>What Personal Data is Collected by Linode?
				<p>
				Linode considers any information that can be used to directly or indirectly
				identify you to be Personal Data, including without limitation, Personal Data that is
				accessed, collected, maintained, transmitted and/or used by Linode in the normal
				course of our business, and is subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy
				and applicable law.
				</p>
				</li>

				<li>How is Personal Data Collected by Linode?
				<p>
				Linode collects and logs your IP address, the time and duration of your visit,
				the time and duration of the pages on Linode's website that you view (where
				applicable) and information about your computer system, such as your browser
				type and operating system, whenever a Linode Resource is accessed or used by
				you. In the case of Customers, we collect, maintain, transmit and/or use
				Personal Data provided by you in your Account, including without limitation,
				your full name, Linode identification number, billing data and contact
				information.
				</p>
				<p>
				Linode also collects anonymous usage information on Visitors to its website
				through use of <a href="https://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics</a>.
				Google Analytics may employ third party tracking cookies to gather anonymous
				browser, operating system, geographic, and website navigation information. Use
				of the Linode Manager interface requires the acceptance of cookies for login
				session management purposes.
				</p>
				<p>
				Linode will likely place a cookie on your hard drive during the web visit. A
				cookie is a unique alphanumeric identifier that Linode uses to determine the
				number of unique Visitors that view its website, whether or not those Visitors
				are repeat Visitors, and the source of the visits. Cookies cannot be executed as
				code or used to deliver a virus. Other servers cannot read cookies and personal
				information cannot be gathered from cookies. Cookies are simply an identifier
				shared between you and Linode to allow Linode to improve the services Linode
				offers to you through its website. If you do not wish cookies to be placed on
				your computer, then they can be disabled in your web browser. The option to do
				so is normally found in your browser's "security settings" section. However,
				please note, permanently disabling cookies in your browser may hinder your use
				of Linode's website as well as other website and interactive services.
				</p>
				<p>
				A web beacon, also known as a web bug, is a small graphic (usually 1 pixel x 1
				pixel), that is embedded in a web advertisement, email, or page on Linode's
				website, which is invisible to you. When you view a page on Linode's website, an
				e-mail or an advertisement, your web browser will request the web beacon from a
				web server, which in turn will set a cookie in your web browser containing a
				unique identifier. This unique identifier will be linked to log information that
				is used to track your usage of Linode's website in order to determine the
				effectiveness of content and advertising campaigns.
				</p>
				<p>
				Linode does not collect personal information about you as part of a web visit,
				but web visit information may be tied to other information (including personal
				information) that Linode collects from you via chat, web forms, and the other
				means Linode describes in this Privacy Policy.

				</li>
