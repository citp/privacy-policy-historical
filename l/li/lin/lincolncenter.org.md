Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Inc. ("LCPA" or “we”) knows you care about your personal information.  This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”), which is part of our overall Terms and Conditions of Use, is designed to provide you with information about how we collect, use, and share the personal information that we may collect from you when you visit our websites, use our other online services, purchase our products, or otherwise interact with LCPA.  

## **How We Collect Information**

We collect personal information from you when you visit our websites, register with us, use our other online services or otherwise interact with LCPA.  For example, we collect personal information from you when you sign up for a newsletter or make an online purchase.  In those instances, we will ask you for information such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, certain demographic information and (if needed) credit card information.  As discussed below, we use this information to register you as a unique user, let you access personalized services, purchase tickets to shows or other events, and for other purposes.

## **How We Use Cookies**

A "cookie" is a text file, invoked by standard browser software, that we place on your hard drive when you visit our websites.  We use cookies and other similar technologies to enable our systems to, among other things, recognize your browser, track transactions, and allow you to navigate our websites and other online services without having to re-enter information.

We may receive and store certain other types of information through the use of cookies and similar technologies, such as the pages you link to from our websites.  This information helps us to understand how visitors use our websites and other online services, and helps to ensure that our websites, online services, and communications with you stay relevant and useful.

_We do not share personal information that we gather through cookies and similar technologies with third parties, except as set forth in this Policy._

Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you turn off the ability to use cookies and similar technologies, you may find that certain functionalities built into our websites and other online services do not work properly, or at all, and your overall user experience may be harmed.  For more information about cookies and similar technologies, including how to set your browser to reject cookies, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

## **How We Use Personal Information**

We use personal information for a number of different activities.  For example, we may use personal information to communicate with you, to register you as a user, to allow you to make purchases, to ship tickets and other merchandise to you, to allow you to manage your subscriptions and memberships, to help you participate in special promotions and fundraising opportunities, to help you navigate our websites and other online services without re-entering information, to administer our websites and other online services, to comply with applicable laws, and as otherwise provided in this Policy.

Some of our programs use personal information to send updates and notices to registered users via e-mail. If you provide your mailing address or telephone number, we may also use that personal information to contact you when we have special offers, fundraising opportunities, or new services or events that we think may be of interest to you, or to provide you with updated information about us or our websites and online services.

In each of the cases described in this Policy, we process or share personal information only if: (a) we have your consent for doing so, (b) we believe we have a legitimate interest in doing so, (c) we need to process or share your data in order to perform or deliver the service you have requested, or (d) we are processing or sharing the data in compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject.

## **When We Share Your Personal Information**

We may engage third-parties in order to help us manage our websites and other online services, and to allow us to better serve our visitors and customers.  These may include third-party vendors engaged to analyze personal information for marketing purposes, so that we can provide you with more relevant and useful information, such as information about special offers, fundraising opportunities, or new services or events that may be of interest to you.  We make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parties only use personal information we provide to perform services for us and to protect such personal information in a commercially reasonable manner.

We may occasionally make personal information available to select other organizations that may be of interest to you, including but not limited to non-profit arts organizations, affiliated organizations, companies or organizations with whom we have a contractual or sponsor relationship, or in connection with an asset transfer.  We may also provide aggregated data to these and other organizations for marketing and fundraising purposes.  Although we may make reasonable inquiries to determine that such other organizations maintain commercially reasonable privacy policies, we are not responsible for the handling of data or information of any such organization.

Our websites and online services may contain links to third-party websites and online services.  This privacy policy will not apply to any third-party websites or other online services.

## **Administration Of Our Website / Compliance With Law**

We may disclose personal information when we have reason to believe that disclosing it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms and Conditions of Use or to protect the safety, property or other rights of our users or the public. In addition, we may disclose or access personal information for administrative and other purposes that we believe are necessary to develop, maintain, and improve our products and services. We also may disclose personal information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process.

## **How You Can Review And Change Your Personal Information**

We encourage users to update and edit their personal information and keep it current by notifying us of any changes.  You can contact us at [customerservice@lincolncenter.org](mailto:customerservice@lincolncenter.orga) or by writing to us at:

In certain jurisdictions, such as the European Union, you may have a right to access, correct, port, or erase the data we have about you, or to object to certain processing or sharing activities.  To make such a request or objection, contact us at [customerservice@lincolncenter.org](mailto:customerservice@lincolncenter.org). 

## **How We Protect Personal Information**

We take commercially reasonable steps to maintain the security of customer information, including personal information, via a variety of access controls, including password protection, electronic firewalls, and data encryption. However, no mode of transmission or method of storage can be completely secure, so we cannot guarantee the security of such information.

We will retain your personal information only for as long as we reasonably need it for legal or business purposes.  When we no longer need your personal information, we will securely delete or destroy it.

## **Other Organizations Featured On Our Website**

We may provide links to other websites and online services, but we are not responsible for the privacy policies, terms and conditions of use, or content of any such websites or online services. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and terms and conditions of use of linked websites and online services. If you provide information – personal or otherwise – to such websites or online services, that information will be subject to their privacy policies.

## **Cross-Border Data Transfer**

We are located in the United States.  If you visit our websites or use our other online services, set up an account with us, purchase our products, or otherwise interact with LCPA, your personal information may be processed in the United States, where the laws regarding the treatment and use of personal information may be different from those in your country.  If you are located in the European Union, we process your data only to the extent needed to provide you the services or products you have purchased, including by administering your account with us and keeping you updated about our events and news.

## **Children Under Thirteen Years of Age**

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under thirteen (13) years of age.
