<b>What personally identifiable information does LinkGrinder collect?</b>

</a></p><p><a name="what">
LinkGrinder collects information in several ways from different parts of our
network of services. 

</a></p><p><a name="what">
Some personal information is gathered when you register. During
registration, LinkGrinder asks for your name, address and email address.
The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better
we are able to customize your experience. Once you register you are no longer
anonymous to LinkGrinder - you are given a LinkGrinder ID and are able to take
full advantage of LinkGrinder's many offerings.

</a><a name="cookies">
<b>What are cookies and how does LinkGrinder use them?</b>

</a></p><p><a name="cookies">
As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services,
LinkGrinder uses </a><a href="http://www.zdwebopedia.com/cookie.htm" target="_top">cookies</a> to store and sometimes track information about
you.  A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from
a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive.  All sites on
LinkGrinder where you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable require
that you accept cookies. 

</p><p>
Generally, we use cookies to:

</p><p>
(1) Remind us of who you are and to access your account information
(stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more
personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or "Sign In"
and is modified when you "Sign Out" of our services.

</p><p>
(2) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing LinkGrinder is given a
unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage,
usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to help
target advertisements based on user interests and behavior.  

</p><p>
(3) Track your progress and number of entries in some of our services.
When a LinkGrinder-hosted promotion uses cookies, the
information written to the cookie indicates the player's progress through
the promotion, and may be used to track entries, submissions, and any other
useful information related to that service. 

</p><p>
(4) Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of LinkGrinder's network of
web sites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate.
We use this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or
different from one another so that we can make each new experience on
LinkGrinder a better one. We may use this information to better personalize the
content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our
sites.  

</p><p>
Advertising networks that serve ads onto LinkGrinder may also use their own cookies.

<a name="how">
<b>How does LinkGrinder use my information?</b>

</a></p><p><a name="how">
LinkGrinder's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide
you, the user, with a customized experience on our network of sites. By knowing
a little about you, LinkGrinder is able to deliver more relevant advertisements
and content, and hence better service, to you. 

</a></p><p><a name="how">
In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, LinkGrinder plays the
middleman. Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of
audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old). LinkGrinder
takes the advertisement and displays it to users meeting that criteria. In
this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account
information. Only LinkGrinder has access to individuals' accounts.  This kind
of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads and email advertisements.  

</a></p><p><a name="how">
LinkGrinder does research on our users' demographics, interests, and
behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, during
a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better
understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an
aggregated basis. LinkGrinder may share this aggregated data with advertisers
or business partners.

</a></p><p><a name="how">
LinkGrinder WILL send advertisements to you!  DO NOT use this service is you do NOT want advertisements.

</a><a name="who">
<b>Who is collecting information</b>

</a></p><p><a name="who">
When you are on a LinkGrinder site and are asked for personal information, you
are sharing that information with LinkGrinder alone, unless it is specifically
stated otherwise. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company
other than LinkGrinder, you will be notified prior to the time of the data
collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can
choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service. 

</a></p><p><a name="who">
Promotions that run on LinkGrinder may be sponsored by companies other than
LinkGrinder or may be cosponsored by LinkGrinder and another company. Some or all
data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data
will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection
or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you
don't want your data to be shared.

</a></p><p><a name="who">
Please be aware that LinkGrinder advertisers or web sites that have links on
our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The
information practices of those web sites linked to LinkGrinder are not covered
by this privacy statement.

</a><a name="share">
<b>With whom does LinkGrinder share my information?</b>

</a></p><p><a name="share">
As a general rule, LinkGrinder will not disclose any of your personally
identifiable information except when we have your permission or under
special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law
requires it or under the circumstances described below.  Please see the
Terms of Service or Use Agreements for each of our products and services
for more detailed information about how your personal information may be
shared.  The following describes some of the ways that your information
may be disclosed. 

</a></p><p><a name="share">
<u>Business Partners &amp; Sponsors</u>: LinkGrinder may disclose your personal
information to business partners or sponsors, but this is specifically
described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the
data. Details of shared use can be found in specific Terms of Service or
Use Agreements, and sweepstakes and promotions rules.  Some or all data
collected during a LinkGrinder promotion may be shared with a sponsor. If
personally identifying data about you will be shared, we will tell you
before we collect or transfer the data. 

</a></p><p><a name="share">
Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from
sponsors. By requesting more information, you give LinkGrinder permission to
transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your
request. In many instances, only your email address will be shared.  If
more information will be shared with the sponsor, you will be notified
prior to the transfer.

</a></p><p><a name="share">
From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or
special offers from third parties.  If you opt-in to receive information from
these third parties, LinkGrinder will (with your permission) share your name
and email address with them.

</a></p><p><a name="share">
<u>Third Party Data &amp; Data in the Aggregate</u>: Under confidentiality
agreements, LinkGrinder may match user information with third party data. Also,
LinkGrinder discloses aggregated user statistics (for example, 45% of our users
are female) in order to describe our services to prospective partners,
advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. 

</a></p><p><a name="share">
<u>Other:</u> LinkGrinder may also disclose account information in special
cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is
necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who
may be violating LinkGrinder's Terms of Service or may be causing injury to or
interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) LinkGrinder's
rights or property, other LinkGrinder users, or anyone else that could be
harmed by such activities. LinkGrinder may disclose or access account
information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for
administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain,
service, and improve our products and services.

<b>What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?</b>

</a></p><p><a name="choice">
LinkGrinder may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and
services.  In addition, we may occasionally send you direct mail about products and
services that we feel may be of interest to you.  Only LinkGrinder (or agents
working on behalf of LinkGrinder and under confidentiality agreements) will
send you these direct mailings and only if you indicated that you do not
object to these offers. If you do not want to receive such mailings,
THEN DO NOT USE OUR SERVICE.

</a></p><p><a name="choice">
You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser
preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified
when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject
all cookies you will be unable to use those LinkGrinder services that require
registration in order to participate.

You may edit your LinkGrinder Account Information at any time by using your LinkGrinder ID
and password. If you have forgotten your password, please
</a><a href="/ForgotPassword.cfm">click here</a> to request a new password. 

</p><p>
Your LinkGrinder account can be deleted or deactivated, but doing so will
result in not being able to access any members-only area of the LinkGrinder
network. If you saved the confirmation email you received when you first
created your LinkGrinder account, you can use the URL provided in that message
to delete your account at any time.

<a name="financial">
<b>How does LinkGrinder protect my personal financial information?</b>

<p>
Keeping your personal financial information private is
vitally important to us.  LinkGrinder will never rent
or sell your personal financial information.

</p><p>
Knowing that you use certain services or features may help us to offer you
better and more relevant content and advertisements.  Any user statistics that we may
provide to prospective advertisers or partners regarding financial product
or service usage on LinkGrinder are provided in the aggregate only and do not
include any personally identifiable information about any individual user.

</p><p>
Please note that there are several places on the LinkGrinder network of Web
sites where you can transmit credit card information in order to complete
a purchase transaction or for verification purposes.  Any time we ask for
a credit card number we transmit that credit card number in an encrypted
format. We use industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.

</a><p><a name="financial">
</a><a name="security">
<b>What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?</b>

</a></p><p><a name="security">
Your LinkGrinder Account Information password-protected so that you and only
you have access to this personal information. You may edit your LinkGrinder
Account Information by using your LinkGrinder ID and password.

</a></p><p><a name="security">
We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.  LinkGrinder will
never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an
unsolicited email.  Also remember to sign out of your LinkGrinder account and
close your browser window when you have finished your work.  This is to
ensure that others cannot access your personal information and
correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a
computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.


</a></p><p><a name="security">
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to
be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal
information, LinkGrinder cannot ensure or warrant the security of any
information you transmit to us or from our online products or services,
and you do so at your own risk.  Once we receive your transmission, we
make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

<b>What else should I know about my privacy?</b>

</a></p><p><a name="else">
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal
information online - for example on message boards, through email, or in
chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In
short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the
public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

</a></p><p><a name="else">
Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your
passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and
responsible whenever you're online.
