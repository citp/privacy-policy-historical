• 1) The user’s mobile phone number (for smart-phone users), or mobile-phone email address (for feature-phone users) will be acquired in order to find other users of the Service who the user knows or may know and register or recommend them as friends, as well as to confirm the identity of the user and prevent any unauthorized use of the Service. 

• 2) The phone-book stored on the device will be used to find other users of the Service who the user knows or may know and register or recommend them as friends, as well as to prevent any unauthorized use of the Service. (Only the phone numbers and mobile email addresses stored in the users’ phone-book will be used.

• 3) In order to carry-over an existing Service account onto another device, or to use the features which allow users to access the same Service account on multiple devices (hereinafter referred to as ‘Multi-device function’), the users will need to register an email address (for feature phone users, this will be the email address mentioned in step one, above) and to configure a password. Email addresses and passwords registered for the purpose of using the Multi-device function will be used for identification purposes as well as to prevent any unauthorized use of the Service.

 **Measurement of Advertising Effectiveness**  
Since the Company shall pay expenses to advertising agencies for Service advertisements published in other media, the Company may install third-party modules within the smartphone versions of the Service application in order to measure the effectiveness of the advertising. Details regarding which applications the third-party modules will be installed on etc., can be viewed [here](http://terms.line.me/line_rules_extmod?lang=en).

 **User Rights**  
Users may, at any time, confirm or correct their registered personal information such as email address and/or password on the Service. Users can also delete their accounts.  
Users may, through the procedures determined by the Company, send the Company a request for the disclosure of personal information which the users cannot confirm/access via the Service. The Company, in turn shall disclose such information except under the following conditions:

• when the disclosure is likely to harm the life, body, property or other rights or interests of the user or any other third party  
• when the disclosure is likely to severely interfere with the Company's proper operation  
• when disclosure itself would constitute a violation of laws and/or regulations  
• when the Company is unable to verify the user’s ownership of the personal information requested for disclosure. 

After the disclosure, users may, through the procedures determined by the Company, send the Company a request to correct, add or delete the user’s personal information, if the users find personal information registered with the Company to be incorrect. Under such circumstances, the Company shall swiftly investigate the request to achieve the desired user intention and correct, add or delete the personal information on the basis of the Company's findings.  
 When users request the disclosure by the Company of their personal information that is unable to be confirmed/accessed though the Service, the Company may charge the users a certain fee for the disclosure procedures. The users can choose freely whether or not they will provide the Company with their personal information, however the users may be unable to use a part of the Service until they have provided the Company with the necessary information.
