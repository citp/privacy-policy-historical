					<p><strong>Link  Market Services Limited (‘Link’) [ABN 54 083 214 537] understands that privacy  is important to you.</strong> <br><br>
Link  is subject to the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) ('Privacy Act')  including the National Privacy Principles, which govern, among other things,  how we handle your personal information.<br>
Our  Privacy Policy is designed to answer the following questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><a href="#1">What personal information does Link collect?</a></li>
                      <li><a href="#2">How is personal information collected and stored?</a></li>
                      <li><a href="#3">How is personal information used?</a></li>
                      <li><a href="#4">Will personal information be given to anyone else?</a></li>
                      <li><a href="#5">How can you access and correct your personal information?</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 id="1">1.  What personal information does Link collect?</h3>
                    <p>Personal  information means information or an opinion from which an individual's identity  may be ascertained.<br>
                      Link,  a provider of registry and registry related services to listed and unlisted  organisations (‘Issuers’) and the holders of their securities (‘you’), may  obtain personal information in order to administer your security holding or to  provide you with other services. If part or all of the information is not  provided, then Link may not be able to supply its services to the Issuers and  you. <br><br>
  <strong><u>Corporations  Act 2001</u></strong><br>
                      In  accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (‘Corporations Act’), Link  collects personal information about you (including name, address and details of  security held) on behalf of the Issuer. This information is included in the  public register of the Issuer in which you hold securities. <br><br>
                      You  may also be asked to provide contact information (including telephone and  facsimile numbers and email address). Other examples of details we may require  from you are your tax file number and financial institution account details. <br>
                      Under  the Corporations Act, your personal information must continue to be included in  the public register of the Issuer for 7 years after you cease to be a security  holder.<br><br>
  <strong><u>Anti  Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing Act 2006</u></strong><br>
                      In  accordance with the Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing Act 2006  (AML/CTF Act), Link may collect personal information about you including but  not limited to, your legal name and other names you may be known by, your  residential street address and your date of birth. Link may also ask you for  identity documents in order to verify your identity. <br><br>
                      This  information is collected on behalf of the Issuer, and, in regards to our ‘Share  Sale Centre’, on behalf of Link/Pacific Custodians Pty Ltd. The AML/CTF Act  requires a designated reporting entity to collect this information where a  ‘customer’ (the investor) is requesting one of the designated services covered  by the AML/CTF Act. <br><br>
                      This  information is generally <strong><u>not</u></strong> included in the public register.  Access to information collected under the AML/CTF Act is restricted to  authorised Link employees, the Issuer for which we collected the information,  the AML/CTF Regulator – AUSTRAC and law enforcement agencies. Your personal  information must be retained for a period of 7 years after the provision of a  designated service. </p>
                      
                      
                      
                    <h3 id="2">2.  How is personal information collected and stored?</h3>
                    <p>This  will depend on how you interact with us or the services you require.<br><br>
                      We may  collect personal information about you from an application form or a  registration form or verbally if you call our call centre or speak directly  with our staff.<br><br>
                      In  addition, if you access your information on-line through our Internet site  [www.linkmarketservices.com.au] (‘our website’) we may collect personal  information relating to your holding during your visit to the website. The  personal information is maintained on our servers, and a reference to this  information is sent to the application you are using to access the Internet, in  the form of a non-persistent "cookie". A "cookie" is a  method employed to maintain a link between the application you are using and  the website you are visiting. It is also used for security purposes.  Non-persistent cookies exist only in the application's memory and are destroyed  when the application is shut down. This behaviour is different to persistent  cookies, which are stored on your computer and which may remain there for an  extended period of time. Link specifically and exclusively uses a  non-persistent (or session) cookie, which means once you exit your application  the cookie and the reference to the data it contains is destroyed.<br><br>
                      For  on-line access to information about your security holding, you will need to  authenticate your identity through a ‘knowledge’ process. This means that you  must identify all of the following three fields adequately to gain and protect  your access on-line:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Holder  Identifier (e.g. your Security Reference Number or Holding Identification  Number)</li>
                      <li>Surname/Company Name  </li>
                      <li>Postcode/Country  Name </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Link  takes reasonable steps to ensure the security of personal information held by  it from such risks as loss or unauthorised access, destruction, use,  modification or disclosure.</p>
                    



                    <h3 id="3">3.  How is personal information used?</h3>
                    <p>Link’s  policy is to use personal information for the purpose for which it was  collected and to offer and provide related services that are connected to that  initial purpose.<br>
                      For  example, the personal information collected from you by Link may be used to: </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Provide  the relevant Issuers and you with registry and registry related services, or  with other information you have requested; and/or </li>
                      <li>Notify  you about other Issuer or Link services relating to the purpose for which your  personal information was collected. If at any time you no longer wish to be  notified about other Issuer or Link services, please let us know. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Please  note that the personal information collected about you may be disclosed to  related companies of the Issuer or Link, but only if this relates to the  purpose for which your personal information was collected.<br><br>
                      Please  note that under the Corporations Act Chapter 2C certain information about you  as a securityholder (including your name, address and details of the securities  you hold) must be included in the public register of the entity in which you  hold securities and, therefore, this information will be disclosed and is in  the public domain. <br><br>
                      Link  will not use or disclose your personal information for any other purpose  without first obtaining your express or implied consent</p>
                      
                      
                    <h3 id="4">4.  Will personal information be given to anyone else?</h3>
                    <p>Our  policy is designed to maintain the confidentiality of all personal information.  We will take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information from  misuse and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.<br><br>
                      Link  does not sell, rent or trade personal information to or with third parties.<br><br>
                      In  some circumstances however, personal information may be disclosed outside Link.<br><br>
                      For  example:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Disclosures  may be required or authorised by or under law (for example, in accordance with  the Corporations Act, where a person requests a copy of an Issuer's register of  security holders). </li>
                      <li>Disclosures  may be required or authorised in accordance with the AML/CTF Act, where the  AML/CTF Regulator – AUSTRAC or a law enforcement agency requests a copy of the  information.</li>
                      <li>Personal  information collected by Link may be disclosed to third parties to which Link  contracts out specialised functions (including mailing houses and printing  companies). If so, we take reasonable steps to ensure that those contractors  comply with the Privacy Act, and are authorised only to use personal  information in order to perform the functions required by Link. </li>
                      <li>Personal  information may be disclosed to third parties in accordance with the Issuer’s  direction where this is related to the Issuer’s administration of security  holdings. </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    
                    <h3 id="5">5.  How can you access and correct your personal information?</h3>
                    <p>Under  the Privacy Act, you have a right to seek access to information that we hold  about you, although there are some exceptions to this (please see Principle 6  of the National Privacy Principles (Extracted from the Privacy Amendment  (Private Sector) Act 2000). You also have the right to ask us to correct information  about you which is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date. Link’s policy is to  consider any requests for access or correction in a timely way and to take  reasonable steps to correct the information so that it is accurate, complete  and up-to-date.<br><br>
                      To provide  you with access to your personal information, Link would ordinarily provide you  with a print-out of the relevant personal information from our current  databases, or with photocopies of records which are held only on current paper  files.<br><br>
                      To  provide you with access to personal information we collected under the AML/CTF  Act, the Issuer and Link/Pacific Custodians will only provide you with a copy  of, or confirmation of, the relevant personal information that we actually  collected from you. The AML/CTF Act prevents the issuer and Link/Pacific  Custodians from revealing certain information.<br><br>
                      To  access and/or correct such information, you may write to or call Link on the  following:</p>
