		<h1>PRIVACY POLICY / YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h1>
		<h3>Last updated: November 5, 2013</h3>
		<p>
			This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and share information when you use our Services.
			The terms "we," "us," or "our" mean LinkOffers.com, and its legal subsidiaries and affiliates.
			The term "Services," means, collectively, various websites, applications, widgets, email
			notifications and other mediums, or portions of such mediums, through which you have
			accessed this Privacy Policy.  By accessing or using our Services, you consent to the
			collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of Your
			Information (collectively, "Use of Your Information") as described in this Privacy Policy.
		</p>

		<p>
			For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Your Information" means information about you,
			which may be of a confidential nature and may include personally identifying information,
			medical and health history information, and/or financial information.
		</p>

		<p>
			This Privacy Policy applies to our Use of Your Information as a result of you using our
			Services, and does not apply to the following:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Information collected through mediums other than our Services;</li>
			<li>Information collected through our Services where a separate privacy policy applies,
				such as a sweepstakes entry (you should refer to the official rules and privacy
				policy for each individual sweepstakes for our specific policies regarding
				information sharing and disclosure pursuant to sweepstakes entry); or
			</li>
			<li>Information collected by any person or entity other than us, even if related to our
				Services (such as a third-party website, application, widget or lead form).
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			In addition to this Privacy Policy, our Services are also governed by our
			<a href="/terms-of-use.aspx" target="_self" class="link_style">Terms of Use</a> and any other documents referred to in
			this Privacy Policy and our	<a href="/terms-of-use.aspx" target="_self" class="link_style">Terms of Use</a>. These
			documents describe information that we collect from you or that you provide on or to the
			Services and how Your Information may be used and disclosed by us. They also describe the
			choices available to you regarding our Use of Your Information and how you can access
			and update Your Information. Please read this Privacy Policy and the
			<a href="/terms-of-use.aspx" target="_self" class="link_style">Terms of Use</a> carefully.
		</p>

		<h2>Information We Collect and Receive About You </h2>

		<p>
			We might receive or collect several types of information about you, such as the
			information described below.
		</p>


		<p><u>Information You Provide</u></p>

		<p>The following are situations in which you may provide Your Information to us:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>When you fill out forms or fields through our Services;</li>
			<li>When you sign up for any newsletters or other materials through our Services;</li>
			<li>When you provide information to us through a third-party application, service or website;</li>
			<li>When you communicate with us or request information about us or our Services, whether via email or other means;</li>
			<li>When you participate in online surveys;</li>
			<li>When you participate in any of our marketing initiatives, including, contests, events, or promotions; and</li>
			<li>When you participate in forums or provide user generated content or submissions.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><u>Information Third Parties Provide</u></p>

		<p>
			We may collect information about you from sources other than you, such as from social
			media websites (i.e., Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or others), blogs, other users and our
			business partners.
		</p>

		<p><u>General Use and Preference Information</u></p>

		<p>
			We may collect, receive and store information regarding your general use of our Services
			(such as details of how and when you used our Services, interactions with our Services,
			log in information, resources that you access, your Internet protocol address, your
			browser type, and your device type), as well as your preferences.
		</p>

		<p><u>Device Information</u></p>

		<p>
			When you use our Services through your computer, mobile phone or other device, we may
			collect information regarding and related to your device, such as hardware models and
			IDs, device type, operating system version, the request type, the content of your
			request and basic usage information about your use of our Services, such as date and
			time. In addition, we may collect information regarding application-level events and
			associate that with your account to provide customer service.  We may also collect and
			store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage
			and application data caches.
		</p>

		<p><u>Location Information</u></p>

		<p>
			If you enable the collection of location information on your device, then we may
			collect information about your actual location, such as your mobile device’s GPS
			coordinates.  We may also use other technologies to determine your location
			(such as through the location of nearby Wi-Fi access points or cell towers), or obtain
			your location information from third parties.
		</p>

		<p><u>Phone Numbers</u></p>

		<p>
			We may collect your phone number in several ways.  For example, we may collect your
			phone number: (i) if you submit your phone number to us through our Services; (ii)
			by capturing your phone number if you call us; or (iii) if a third party provides
			your phone number to us.
		</p>

		<p><u>Cookies and Anonymous Identifiers</u></p>

		<p>
			We and third parties use various technologies to collect and store information when
			you use our Services, including sending cookies, pixel tags or other anonymous
			identifiers to your device. "Cookies" are pieces of data stored on your computer,
			mobile phone or other device.  A "pixel tag" is a type of technology placed within a
			website or email for the purpose of tracking activity, which is often used in
			combination with cookies.  Other "anonymous identifiers" are random strings of
			characters used for the same purposes as cookies, such as with mobile devices where
			cookie technology is not available.  These technologies help us know that you are
			logged on, provide you with features based on your preferences, understand when you are
			interacting with our Services, and compile other information regarding use of our Services.
		</p>

		<p>
			The information collected through these technologies, standing alone, cannot be used to
			determine your identity.  Such information may, however, be combined in a way that makes
			it become personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can identify you).
			If this happens, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information.
		</p>

		<p>
			Please note that, in most cases, you can remove or block cookies (such as by using the
			settings in your browser), but doing so may affect your ability to use our Services.
		</p>

		<p>
			The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other
			third party assets (such as social media) on the Services is not covered by our Privacy
			Policy.  These third parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help
			them better manage their content on our Services.   We do not have access or control
			over these technologies.

		<h2>How We Disclose Information </h2>

		<p><u>General Disclosure of Your Information</u></p>

		<p>We may disclose Your Information:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				To any person who, in our reasonable judgment, is authorized to receive Your Information
				as your agent, including as a result of your business dealings with that person
				(for example, your attorney);
			</li>

			<li>
				To our third-party vendors so that they may provide support for our internal and
				business operations, including for the handling of data processing, data verification,
				data storage, surveys, research, internal marketing, delivery of promotional, marketing
				and transaction materials, and our Services’ maintenance and security. These companies
				are authorized to Use Your Information only as necessary to provide these services to
				us and are contractually obligated to keep Your Information confidential;
			</li>

			<li>
				To third parties such as insurance providers when you use our Services to request a
				quote, services, or information from one or more of those third parties
				("Requested Service Providers"), such as by clicking "get your quotes" or other similar
				buttons at the end of a form;
			</li>

			<li>
				To third parties when you engage in certain activities through our Services that are
				sponsored by them, such as purchasing products or services offered by a third party,
				electing to receive information or communications from a third party, or electing to
				participate in contests, sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored, in whole or
				in part, by a third party.  When we disclose Your Information to these third parties,
				Your Information will become subject to the information use and sharing practices of
				the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with
				respect to its use and further sharing of Your Information;
			</li>

			<li>
				To third parties that are interested in contacting you or providing offers to you that
				may be related to our Services or about products or services you may find of interest;
			</li>

			<li>As required by law or ordered by a court, regulatory, or administrative agency;</li>

			<li>
				As we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, if we believe that you are violating any
				applicable law, rule or regulation, or are otherwise interfering with another’s rights
				or property, including, without limitation, our rights or property;
			</li>

			<li>
				If requested by authorities in the event of any act of terrorism or instance of local,
				regional or national emergency;
			</li>

			<li>To enforce our <a href="/terms-of-use.aspx" target="_self" class="link_style">Terms of Use</a>, this Privacy Policy, and any other applicable agreements and policies;</li>

			<li>To enforce or protect our rights;</li>

			<li>In connection with a Business Transfer, as defined below (see <a href="#businessTransfers" class="link_style">Business Transfers</a> below); and</li>

			<li>To our affiliated companies (i.e., companies under common control or management with us).</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>If you do not want Your Information shared as described above, then you should not provide us with Your Information.</strong></p>

		<p><u>Requests for Quotes and Services from Requested Service Providers</u></p>

		<p>
			As noted above, we may share Your Information with Requested Service Providers when you
			use our Services to request a quote, services or information from one or more third
			parties (a "Request"). <strong>IF YOU SUBMIT A REQUEST, REQUESTED SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY CONTACT
			YOU DIRECTLY WITH QUOTES VIA MAIL, TELEPHONE, TEXT MESSAGE, FAX, EMAIL AND OTHER MEANS
			OF COMMUNICATION.  YOU MAY RECEIVE TELEMARKETING CALLS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUBMITTING
			A REQUEST THROUGH OUR SERVICES, EVEN IF YOU ARE ON THE NATIONAL DO NOT CALL REGISTRY
			OR ANY OTHER DO NOT CALL REGISTRY.</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			If you are matched with Requested Service Providers, you expressly consent to the
			Requested Service Providers conducting any research necessary to provide you with quotes
			for your Request.  Requested Service Providers may need to share Your Information to
			conduct such research.  As an example, if you request insurance quotes, consumer reports
			may be ordered in connection with your insurance application.  Such reports may provide
			information that may assist in determining eligibility for insurance and the price you
			may be charged for insurance.  Consumer reports may also be used for updates, renewal or
			extensions of this insurance.  In addition, insurance companies may use third parties in
			connection with the development of a “insurance score” for you.  <strong>If you do not want
			Requested Service Providers to conduct necessary research to provide you with a quote
			for your Request, then you should not submit a Request.</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Please note that if you submit a Request through our Services and we share Your
			Information as described above in connection with your Request, you will not have the
			opportunity to opt out of the disclosure of Your Information in connection with that Request.</strong>
		</p>

		<p><u>Aggregation and De-Personalization</u></p>

		<p>
			We may take Your Information and de-indentify it either by combining it with information
			about other individuals (aggregating Your Information with information about other
			individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information
			personally identifiable to you (de-identifying Your Information).  We reserve the right
			to share, loan, rent, sell, or otherwise disclose such information to third parties at
			any time, for any lawful purpose, without notice or compensation to you.
		</p>

		<p><u>Sharing with Friends</u></p>

		<p>
			If the Services contains any functionality allowing you to send content to a friend,
			then please be aware that: (a) we may display your email address to your friend; and
			(b) we may use information you provide about your friend to facilitate the communication
			and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.
		</p>

		<p><u>Sweepstakes</u></p>

		<p>
			If you are submitting information to us pursuant to a sweepstakes entry, we reserve the
			right to share, loan, rent, sell or otherwise disclose the information that you submit
			with third parties at any time, for any lawful purpose without notice or compensation to
			you.  Participation in these sweepstakes is completely voluntary and you therefore have
			a choice whether or not to disclose Your Information. Please refer to the official rules
			and privacy policy for each individual sweepstakes for our specific policies regarding
			information sharing and disclosure pursuant to that sweepstakes entry.
		</p>

		<p><u>Circumvention of Security Measures</u></p>

		<p>
			We cannot ensure that Your Information will only be disclosed as described in this
			Privacy Policy. No method of transmission or method of electronic storage, is 100%
			secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. Additionally, by way of example
			(without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose Your Information to the
			government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully
			intercept or access transmissions or private communications.  Therefore, notwithstanding
			anything to the contrary within this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use or any other
			applicable agreement or policy, you use our Services at your own risk and we do not
			promise or guarantee, and you should not expect, that Your Information will always
			remain private.  In the event that an unauthorized third party compromises our security
			measures, we will not be responsible for any damages directly or indirectly caused by
			an unauthorized third party’s ability to view, use or disseminate Your information.
		</p>

		<p><u><a name="businessTransfers">Business Transfers</a></u></p>

		<p>
			We specifically and expressly reserve the right to disclose, lease, sell, assign or
			transfer Your Information collected through our Services, and any of our databases,
			together with any personally identifiable information contained in such databases,
			to third parties in connection with a Business Transfer.  A "Business Transfer" means
			a share or asset sale, acquisition, merger, consolidation, reorganization, spin-off,
			bankruptcy or other corporate change involving us and/or our affiliates, even if the
			Business Transfer is only being contemplated and regardless of whether the Business
			Transfer relates to a part or a whole of our business.  Nothing in this Privacy Policy
			is intended to interfere with our ability to transfer all or part of our business,
			equity, and/or assets (including our Services) to an affiliate or independent third
			party at any time, for any lawful purpose, without compensation to you.
		</p>


		<h2>Children’s Information </h2>
		<p>
			You must be at least 13 years of age to register with or use certain portions of the
			Services.  The Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age.  No one
			under 13 years of age may provide any personal information to or on the Services.
			We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.  If you believe

		</p>

		<h2>Network Advertising</h2>

		<p>
			From time to time, we may participate in or use advertising networks, such as
			third-party advertising servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors and research
			firms.  We may use these third-party advertising networks for marketing, advertising
			and promotional purposes, as well as to serve advertisements to you.  Advertising
			networks often gather data about consumers who view advertisements to make inferences
			about a consumer’s interests and preferences, which enables their computers to deliver
			advertisements directly targeted to the consumer’s specific interests.  This practice
			is often referred to as “online behavioral advertising.”  For example, a third-party
			advertising network might collect the type of Internet browser you use, the type of
			computer operating system you use, the domain name of a website you visit, whether or
			not you visit specific pages of a website, the location of your Internet service
			provider’s presence, the date and time of a visit to a website and other interactions
			between you and a website.  Please see the “Online Behavioral Advertising” subsection
			of <a href="#useYourInfo" class="link_style">Choices About How We Use and Collect Your Information</a> below to read about how you
			can prevent certain third-party advertising networks from collecting information about you.
		</p>

		<p>
			Some comment areas are managed by a third party application that may require you to
			register to post a comment.  We do not have access or control of the information posted
			to the blog.  You will need to contact or login into the third party application if you
			want the personal information that was posted to the comments section removed.  To learn
			how the third party application uses your information, please review their privacy policy.
