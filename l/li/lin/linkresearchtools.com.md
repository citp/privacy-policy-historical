stored on your device via a web server. Cookies cannot import viruses or run programs on
your device. One of the main reasons for using cookies is to improve your website usage by
helping you save time. Cookies will tell the web server that you have returned to a specific
page. This will retrieve the information previously provided, allowing you to use any
customized features again. You can chose to reject cookies. Most browsers accept cookies by
default, but you may change your browser settings to refuse cookies. If you do so, you may
not be able to use the full functionality of our website(s).
