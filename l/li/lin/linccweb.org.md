# College Center for Library Automation - Privacy Statement

Your privacy is very important to us. Our policy is to collect no personal information about you when you visit this site, unless you affirmatively choose to make such information available to us.

When you visit FLVC websites, the web server automatically recognizes only the Internet domain and IP address from which you accessed the site. This information does not result in the identification of your personal email address or other personal information.

In addition, information is gathered regarding the volume and timing of access to the site by collecting information on the date, time, and pages you visited while at the site. This is done so that the content of the site can be improved. This information is not shared with other organizations. Again, only aggregate information is collected, and your personal information is not identified.

If you choose to share personal information, such as sending a message or filling out an electronic form with personal information, the information will only be used for the purposes you authorized. Some of this information may be saved for a designated period of time in order to comply with Florida's archiving policies. However, information will not be disclosed to third parties or other government agencies, unless required by state or federal law. If information is required by law to be disclosed about you, then every effort will be taken to notify you about the disclosure in advance.

You are advised that any information provided to FLVC may be subject to public disclosure as required by Public Records laws as set forth in Chapter 119, Florida Statutes; FLVC cannot guarantee absolute privacy of electronic communication.

It is your obligation to determine and satisfy copyright or other usage restrictions when copying, printing, publishing, or otherwise distributing material found using FLVC’s websites.

If you have other questions about our privacy and use policy, or have suggestions on how this policy can be improved, please feel free to email us at [help@flvc.org](http://www.linccweb.org/cmn/contactus.asp?mailto=webmaster).
