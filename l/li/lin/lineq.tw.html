Please note that, you can only find users who are also using the “Shake It!” feature.&nbsp; The successful operation of the “Shake It!” feature will result in the sharing of your LINE profile information with other nearby users of the “Shake It!” feature, and their LINE profile information will be shared with you.&nbsp;
