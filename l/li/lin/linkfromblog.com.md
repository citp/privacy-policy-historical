However, LinkFromBlog may display targeted content based on personally non-identifiable information (such as browser type and IP address) and/or personal selection.

LinkFromBlog may use your personal information where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction, to operate or improve LinkFromBlog and related products and services, to do something that you have asked us to do, or tell you of products and services that we think may be of interest.

LinkFromBlog may use your email address to contact you with required email messages about the Service.

Where you are contacted with an offer or service based on information you have shared with LinkFromBlog, we will do our best to provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of receiving such further communications at the time you are contacted. 

LinkFromBlog does or may share personally identifiable information about you under the following circumstances:

In the course of operating our business, it may be necessary or appropriate for us to provide access to your personal information to others such as our service providers, contractors and select vendors so that we can operate the Service and our business. Where practical, we seek to obtain confidentiality agreements that are consistent with this policy and that limit others' use or disclosure of the information you have shared.

We may transfer personal information to certain advertising partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply.

We may share your personal information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, if in our judgment, disclosure is required or appropriate in such circumstances.

We may share your personal information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of LinkFromBlog terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

As we continue to develop our business, we might also sell all or part of our business. In such transactions, personally identifiable information you have shared with us is generally one of the business assets that may be transferred. The transferred personally identifiable information will remain subject to the promises made in this privacy policy or subsequent policies to which you have consented.  


If there is ever a change to how LinkFromBlog uses or intends to use personal information, we will post that change to this policy and, if the new policy is materially less restrictive than this policy, we will seek your consent.
