THERE IS NOTHING ELSE EVEN CLOSE TO WHAT DUNCAN HAS DELIVERED…”</h3>			<div class="textwidget"><p>"As someone who launched one of the first SEO companies back in the mid 90's, I can state without hesitation that I've seen almost every SEO book, document, video, and everything else that has come along related to SEO in the past 15 years. I want to tell you about a new SEO guide from Duncan Carver that I consider to be the definitive SEO guide of the modern SEO Era.</p>
<p>It's called The Ultimate Link Building Dossier, and it's simply one of the best SEO guides I have ever seen. Period. If SEO or getting ranked in the search engines play any part in your business, and you ignore Duncan's two hundred page gem, well, let's just say you're making the biggest mistake of your online marketing career.</p>
<p>I've shown the dossier to a couple of my SEO friends and each has had the same response. And that response is "wow"! I don't care if you've been in the SEO game since day one, or just getting started, this is the one guide you absolutely MUST have. I'll stake my reputation on this one. There is nothing else even close to what Duncan has delivered."</p>

And you're always at the top of my list of experts. When you released "The Ultimate Link Building Dossier" I couldn't believe my good fortune...</p>
<p>After I begun going through everything it soon became clear to me that you weren't holding back. There is no doubt in my mind that the training you're giving away would normally only be found in a $700 home study course. I've already started implementing some of your superb strategies. My favorite being "XXX XXXXX XXXXXXXXX". It's the best and for me the easiest linking idea I've discovered in a very long time.</p>
<p>My next step is to build a team of outsourced workers to put even more of what you teach into action. There's so much you reveal in The Ultimate Link Building Dossier I could never do it all myself. After reading through your work there's one thing I'm absolutely certain of... anyone who gets their hands on this will never be short of traffic ever again. I give "The Ultimate Link Building Dossier" my highest possible commendation. All the best!"</p>

So when I picked up your manual, the last thing I expected was to learn anything new about article marketing.</p>
<p>Well, it was quickly obvious that I have overlooked some powerful writing strategies. I'm starting right away to work them into my own link building routine. Specifically, I'm going to change how I write around my keywords, because I had one of those 'light bulb moments' when I saw how you link your keywords to a writing program. Excellent stuff, Duncan. </p>
<p>And thanks also for that Action Plan in the final section of the Dossier. I've been employing writers in Asia for the last year, and I am now going to use that Plan to widen out the type of work they do for me. A great resource, brim full of practical, audacious link building strategies and tactics. Thoroughly recommended"</p>

You were talking about XXX XXXXX XXXXXXXXXX being the key to a link's value, which is a new idea to me, and how this can be taken advantage of deliberately in a number of ways... including, astonishingly directory links. To be honest, to me that alone is worth the price of the book.</p>
<p>This changes my understanding of SEO, which hasn't happened in a long time. I've *seen* this concept in action but never understood what was happening: things like an inner page of a client's site being picked to rank over the home page I'm actually linking to (using the inner page's keyword in anchor text pointing to the home page). Multiple pages of the same site being picked to rank top 3... I've used it in my link building to a limited extent with good success.</p>
<p>I'll have to re-read it several times to embed and grasp the implications. The book is well written and clear. You give lots of examples which is how I understand information practically. I'm a happy buyer."</p>

Sometimes we can get set in our ways and not "see the forest for the trees" - In the first chapter, some lights went on... i checked one of my sites (which is at number 1 for its main keyword), and the factors you specified were exactly right.</p>
<p>As for the rest, its no BS, no fluff, stuff you can really use right now, rather than over hyped sales material. Thank you for saving me $100s in looking at other products, which I don't need!"</p>
<p>Paul Easton, Auckland, New Zealand</p>
<p>PS: One of the products you recommended I have been using for 2 months, and its resulted in increased ranking in amounts from 100 - 500 places in Google!</p>

I've been working online for several years so I am aware of the many different backlink creation strategies. The problem is that I had all the information jumbled up in my mind. I would jump from one approach to another without having any kind of overall strategy.</p>
<p>While reading your ebook it began to fall into place. I now have a plan with a solid understanding of precisely what actions I need to take and which ones are more important than others. Thank you!"</p>

		</div></li><li id="text-10" class="widget_text widget fix"><div class="widget-pad"><h3 class="widget-title">“The wide variety of link building techniques in the book is literally mind boggling…”</h3>			<div class="textwidget"><p>"I’m a relative newbie, particularly in the minefield that is link building and I wasn’t sure whether I should buy this book or not. Well, the answer is I’m glad I did because it has really opened my eyes to the possibilities and rewards that are available if you go down the right path. And this book does just that.</p>
<p>The wide variety of link building techniques in the book is literally mind boggling and I can guarantee that there are some you haven’t used before or, if you have, probably not to the their full extent.</p>
<p>Not only does it lay out lots of link building options for consideration but it is written in a very easy conversational manner which was a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>Finally, I can honestly say that this is the first time I have really understood the ins and outs of link building and the way to go about it to get the highest rewards – which you will if you read it. It's now printed out into a binder and will be my link building reference from now on." ~ Joe Watson</p>

Last year my site was pulling in about 21 people per day. Now I am averaging 91 in the last month of Google Analytics data.</p>
<p>So far, the clarity of the issue as you have presented is the best of all of the books so far. I may have a few questions as I go. Thanks again for the follow-up. Regards,"</p>
