Company shall take reasonable steps to accurately record the personal information that you provide to us and any subsequent updates. You are encouraged to review, update, and correct any personal information that we maintain about you, and you may request that we delete personal information about you that is inaccurate, incomplete, or irrelevant for legitimate purposes, or is processed in a manner that violates any applicable legal requirements for the handling of personal information, by contacting us as provided herein. You may request to review, edit, correct, or delete your personal information at any time by contacting our support team. Your right to review, update, correct, and delete your personal information may be limited, subject to the law or your jurisdiction: (i) where the rights or safety of another person or persons would be encroached upon, (ii) if the information or material you request relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings between you and us, or providing access to you would prejudice negotiations between us or an investigation of possible unlawful activity, or (iii) if your requests are abusive and/or unreasonably excessive. Your right to review, update, correct and delete your information is subject to our records retention policies and applicable federal and state data retention laws.

**RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Requests that we delete your personal information can be sent to our customer support team.

**LEGAL BASIS FOR DATA PROCESSING**  
Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal information is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the information subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal information is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal information may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal information. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).

**CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**  
BY USING THIS WEBSITE AND/OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE THAT YOU AS THE DATA SUBJECT CONSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. YOU AGREE THAT LINUXJOURNAL MAY MAKE CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY AT ANY TIME WITHOUT ANY GIVEN NOTICE AT ITS DISCRETION.
