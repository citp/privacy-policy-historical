<p>Last modified May 1, 2013</p>
<p>Aztec media inc. ("Linkey Project") takes your privacy very seriously. Please read the following to learn more about Linkey Project's Privacy Policy ("Policy"). This Policy details how Linkey Project receives, collects and uses information in connection with its website located at www.linkeyproject.com ("Site").</p>
<p class="sub_title">Collection and Use of Information</p>
<p class="sub_title">Information You Provide:</p>
<p>You can use the Site and access software without providing any Personal Information (defined below). However, in connection with other activities through the Site, you may be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information, which may include your name, email address, age, gender, address, telephone number(s), areas of interest, login name, login password and other self-identifying information (all "Personal Information"). It is entirely optional for you to engage in these activities. Linkey Project collects this Personal Information primarily for the following purposes: (i) to maintain a record of registered users; (ii) to manage the login process and maintain users' personal preferences; (iii) to email registered users with news and updates; and (iv) to email promotional offers. In addition, Linkey Project may also collect information about you in surveys or for sweepstakes and contests on the Site and information about the searches you perform, promotional offers you choose and the pages you visit on the Site.

For example, Linkey Project may use "cookies," "web beacons" and similar devices to track your activities on the Site. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. A web-beacon is a small transparent gif image that is embedded in an HTML page or email used to track when the page or email has been viewed. Cookies make web-surfing easier by saving preferences and browsing patterns while you are at Linkey Project's Site. Cookies may be used to analyze Site usage, improve content, customize the Site's content and layout and for other customer service purposes.

If you access another website or promotion and/or service through a website operated by any entity other than Linkey Project, that site is referred to as a "Third Party Site".

As such, Linkey Project is not responsible for, or have control over, the content or the privacy policies of these Third Party Sites. You must read the privacy policies of each and every website that you visit when linking from the Site. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Linkey Project.</p>
<p class="sub_title">Children's Privacy</p>
<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. We operate our website in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The Site is intended solely for users who are of adult age in their jurisdiction, and any registration by, use of, or access to the Site or services by anyone under the age of majority is unauthorized, unlicensed, and in violation of this Privacy Policy. By using the Site, you represent and warrant you are of adult age in your jurisdiction and that you agree to abide by all of the terms and conditions herein. Linkey Project may terminate your account, project, and any content or information that you have posted on the Site and/or prohibit you from using or accessing the Site for any reason, at any time in its sole discretion, with or without notice, including without limitation if Linkey Project believes that you have misrepresented your age. Linkey Project never knowingly collects or maintains information at or on our Site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of the Site is directed at or structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>
<p class="sub_title">Security</p>
<p>Linkey Project takes reasonable precaution to protect Personal Information from misuse, loss and unauthorized access. Although Linkey Project cannot guarantee that Personal Information will not be subject to unauthorized access, Linkey Project has physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the Personal Information. Personal Information is protected by secured networks and access is limited to a few authorized employees and personnel. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.</p>
<p>If you contact Linkey Project by e-mail or a "contact us" or similar feature on the Site, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that Linkey Project believes that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, Linkey Project may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, Linkey Project will endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent Linkey Project has your e-mail address, it may notify you by e-mail. <b>You consent to use of e-mail as a means of such notification.</b></p>
<p>If you prefer to use another method to notify you in this situation, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@linkeyproject.com">info@linkeyproject.com</a> with the alternative contact information you wish to be used.</p>
<p>With identity theft a continuing problem, it has become increasingly common for unauthorized individuals to send e-mail messages to consumers, purporting to represent a legitimate company such as a bank or on-line merchant, requesting that the consumer provide personal, often sensitive information. Sometimes, the domain name of the e-mail address from which the e-mail appears to have been sent, and the domain name of the web site requesting such information, appears to be the domain name of a legitimate, trusted company. In reality, such sensitive information is received by an unauthorized individual to be used for purposes of identity theft. This illegal activity has come to be known as "phishing." If you receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that you provide any sensitive information (including your password or credit card information) via e-mail or to a web site that does not seem to be affiliated with this Site, or that otherwise seems suspicious to you, please do not provide such information, and report such request to <a href="mailto:info@linkeyproject.com">info@linkeyproject.com</a>.</p>
<p>IF YOU ARE A USER ACCESSING THE SITE FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, ASIA, OR ANY OTHER REGION WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING PERSONAL DATA COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE THAT DIFFER FROM UNITED STATES LAWS, PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THROUGH YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICES, WHICH ARE GOVERNED BY UNITED STATES LAW, THIS PRIVACY POLICY, AND LINKEY PROJECT' TERMS OF USE, YOU ARE TRANSFERRING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES AND YOU CONSENT TO THAT TRANSFER. ADDITIONALLY, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE TRANSFERRED TO AND PROCESSED IN COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN IN YOUR COUNTRY.</p>
<p class="sub_title">Data Retention</p>
<p>Linkey Project will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that Linkey Project no longer uses your information to provide you services, you may delete your account by notification to<a href="mailto:info@linkeyproject.com">info@linkeyproject.com</a>. Linkey Project may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with its legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Consistent with these requirements, Linkey Project will try to delete your information quickly and upon request. Please note, however, that there may be latency in deleting information from the Linkey Project servers and backed-up versions might exist after deletion. In addition, Linkey Project will not delete from its servers files that you may have in common with other users.</p>
<p class="sub_title">Business Transitions</p>
<p>In the event that Linkey Project goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. Linkey Project will post a notice on this Site of any such change in ownership or control of the Personal Information Linkey Project may have prior to such transfer.</p>
<p class="sub_title">Changes to Policy</p>
<p>From time to time, Linkey Project may revise this Policy. Linkey Project will post the revised Policy on the Site, so that users can always be aware of what information Linkey Project collects, how the information is used and under what circumstances such information may be disclosed. If Linkey Project makes a change in its data collection policy that would result in a materially more permissive use of your personally identifiable data, Linkey Project will obtain your prior affirmative consent before implementing the change with respect to your data. You should also visit this page periodically to review any changes to the Privacy Notice.</p>
<p class="sub_title">Change or Removal of Information</p>
