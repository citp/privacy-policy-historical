1\. "What information do you gather about me when I'm at your site and what do you do with it?"   
  
The information we gather about you really depends upon what you do while you're at our site. Below are common activities and what we will ask of you.

**Catalog Requests.** We need a name and an address to send the catalog to. Plus a contact, either phone or e-mail, in case the address is wrong. To be removed from our mailing list at any time, call 800-466-8447.

**Register to Win.** We simply need an e-mail address and your home state. 

**Purchases.** Your complete name, address, phone number, e-mail, and credit card information are necessary for purchase and delivery. Because most of our customers like to know that we received their order, we use your e-mail address to send you an order confirmation. We also use your e-mail address to let you know when we ship your order.

Because you have shown an interest in our products by registering, requesting a catalog or making a purchase, you may receive communications from us in the form of telephone contact, printed catalogs or e-mails with questions or information regarding orders you have placed and information about new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive any or all of these communications, please let us know. You can [ contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20101229065013id_/http%3A//www.linensource.com/default.aspx?page=contactus) by e-mail, phone, fax or in writing. Please provide us with your **exact** name, address, e-mail and phone number and let us know which communications you would like halted.

From time to time, we exchange names, and other personal information with other companies whose products, and services might interest you, but only with your consent. If you do not want to have your name or other personal information shared with other companies, you can contact us by e-mail, phone, fax or in writing.  
  
2\. "Do you keep track of me as I move through the **linen _source_** site?"   
  
For each visitor to our web site, our web server automatically recognizes only the visitor’s domain name. We collect domain names and aggregate information on what pages visitors access or view. Essentially, our web site is an online store. As such, in order to better serve our customers, we need to know which pages they view and how they get there.  
  
3\. "Does linen _source_ use cookies?"   
  
Like any business, we need to know the effectiveness of various marketing efforts. We use cookies to identify how a person came to our site. This cookie contains absolutely no personal information about you. Cookies can be set with an expiration period. At linen _source_ , our cookies are set to expire after 90 days.  
  
4\. Communicating with linen _source_ via e-mail.   
  
We read every message that comes to us. We also try to respond back within 24 hours of receipt. We save messages and/or e-mail addresses only for a few specific reasons. We save messages if we think we'll need to refer to them later when we communicate with the customer. We do not use e-mail addresses that we receive through our Customer Service form, or from e-mails that we receive in correspondence directly from you, for the purpose of promotion, unless authorized to do so.  
  
5\. "How can I review the information you have for me?"  
  
If you created an online account, you may click on the 'Login' or 'My Account' link at the top of the page. There you will see the information you have supplied to us to place orders on our web site.  
  
6\. "How does linen _source_ notify customers of changes to its privacy Policy?"   
  
The current version of the linens _ource_ privacy policy will always be posted here.  
Questions regarding this statement should be directed to [Customer Service](https://web.archive.org/web/20101229065013id_/http%3A//www.linensource.com/default.aspx?page=email).
