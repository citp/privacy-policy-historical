We do not collect Sensitive Personal Data on EU / UK individuals. However, if you are a UK or EU individual or resident in the EU or UK before ever collecting and/or using any Sensitive Personal Data we will establish a lawful exemption which will allow us to use that information.

We will make sure that we only use your personal information for the purposes set out above and in Appendix 2 where we are satisfied that: 

  * you have provided your consent to us using the data in that way; or 
  * our use of your personal information is necessary to perform the Services under the Terms and Conditions which you have executed with us or in order to take steps at your request prior to your entering into those [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/transparency/terms) with us; or 
  * our use of your personal information is necessary to comply with a relevant legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to; or 
  * our use of your personal information is necessary to support the 'legitimate interests' that we have as a business, provided it is conducted at all times in a way that is proportionate, and that respects your privacy rights. In all such cases, we will look after your information at all times in a way that is proportionate and respects your privacy rights and you have a right to object to this processing as explained further in Appendix 2. 



If you would like to find out more about the legal basis for which we process personal information, please contact us. 

###  Direct marketing 

We may use your personal information to send you direct marketing communications about the Services or our related services. This may be in the form of email, post, SMS, telephone or targeted online advertisements This may also include email communications, including information that we think may be of interest to you, and information on upcoming changes or improvements. 

In most cases our processing of your personal information for marketing purposes is based on our legitimate interests, although in some cases (such as where required by applicable laws or where we use or process any of your Sensitive Personal information or Sensitive Data) it may be based on your explicit consent. You can find out more on how we process your Sensitive Personal Data and Sensitive Information above. 

You have a right to prevent direct marketing of any form at any time - this can be exercised by following the opt-out links in electronic communications, or contact us. When you receive any permitted electronic marketing communications from us, you may opt out of receiving further marketing communications by following the opt-out instructions provided in the communication. Please specify whether you would like us to stop all forms of marketing or just a particular type (e.g. email). 

You can also change the way your browser manages cookies, which may be used to deliver online advertising, by following the settings on your browser. See further our Cookies section above and our [Cookies Policy](https://web.archive.org/transparency/cookie). 

####  For EU/UK individuals: When and how we carry out profiling and automated decision making 

We do not conduct any automated decision-making on your personal information. We may use limited profiling or other forms of automated processing for: 

  * security purposes only to assess if your account may be fraudulent, a spam account or suspect in any way; 
  * the purposes of marketing, and where this is completed we undertake to do this to pursue our legitimate interests of ensuring our marketing communications are relevant to you, its audience and persons to whom it is targeted. 



As profiling uses automated processing, it is sometimes connected with automated decision making. Not all profiling results in automated decision making, but it can do. 

Please note, you have certain rights (including a right to object) in respect of automated decision making, where that decision has significant effects on you, including where it produces a legal effect on you. See below for more information about your rights. 

###  Accessing, correcting and updating your personal information 

To request access to personal information we hold about you, please contact us. If that information is incorrect, out of date or incomplete, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When requesting access or changes to your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we act on your request. 

There are some circumstances in which we are not required to give you access to your personal information. We may reject requests that are unlawful, frivolous, vexatious, unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing existing practices), that we believe risk the privacy, health or safety of others, or would be otherwise be extremely impractical (for example requests concerning information on our backup systems or unique ID data on Users). 

Where we provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where in our opinion it would require a disproportionate effort or cost for us to do so. We may require you to meet our reasonable costs in providing you with access including for photocopying and postage. 

Where you correct, update or otherwise provide personal information, you represent to us that the information you provide to us is, having regard to the circumstances, accurate, up to date and complete, having regard to the purposes of the disclosure, and not misleading or deceptive.

---|---  
Access |  You can ask us to: 

  * confirm whether we are processing your personal information; 
  * give you a copy of that data; 
  * provide you with other information about your personal information such as what data we have, what we use it for, who we disclose it to, whether we transfer it abroad and how we protect it, how long we keep it for, what rights you have, how you can make a complaint, where we got your data from, to the extent that information has not already been provided to you in this Privacy Policy.

  * it has been processed unlawfully; or 
  * to comply with a legal obligation to which LiveHire is subject. 



We are not required to comply with your request to erase your personal information if the processing of your personal information is necessary: 

  * for compliance with a legal obligation; or 
  * for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. 

  
Restriction  |  You can ask us to restrict (i.e. keep but not use) your personal information, but only where: 

  * its accuracy is contested (see Rectification), to allow us to verify its accuracy; or 
  * the processing is unlawful, but you do not want it erased; or 
  * it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected, but we still need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or

Objection  |  You can object to any processing of your personal information which has our 'legitimate interests' as its legal basis, if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests.

If you wish to access any of the above mentioned rights, we may ask you for additional information to confirm your identity and for security purposes, in particular before disclosing personal information to you. We reserve the right to charge a fee where permitted by law, for instance if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.

This may be for a seven (7) year period unless the applicable law prescribes otherwise. If you would like more information on how we retain your data, please contact us. 

###  Security 

We recognise our responsibility to protect the personal information that you entrust to us. We take security very seriously and work together with you, developers and external security experts to design security into our products from the ground up (including through implementing privacy by design and security by design measures. 

We store most information about you in computer systems and databases operated by either us or our external cloud Service Providers. Some information about you may be recorded in paper files that we store securely. Our information storage is on secure computers in locked information centres and data is encrypted, wherever possible. However, as the transmission of information across the internet is not completely secure we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our website and issues can arise. 

We will also take reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify personal information once we no longer require it for the purposes for which it was collected or for any secondary purpose permitted under the Australian Privacy laws and/or other applicable data privacy laws. 

We recommend that you create a secure password, do not disclose your password and account details to anyone, and that you change your password each month. As the security of information depends in part on the security of the computer or device you use to communicate with us and the security you use to protect your user IDs and passwords, we encourage you to please take appropriate measures to protect this information. 

Our Platform is operated using security measures, including SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption, to protect your personal data. SSL is an industry standard encryption protocol, and this ensure that the information is reasonably protected against unauthorised interception. 

We also implement and maintain processes and security measures to protect personal information which we hold from misuse, interference or loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. These processes and measures may include: 

  * requiring all employees to comply with internal information security policies and keep information secure; 
  * requiring all employees to complete training about information security; and 
  * monitoring and regularly reviewing our practices against our own policies and against industry best practice
