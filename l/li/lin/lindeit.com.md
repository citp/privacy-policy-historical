8.5 If the customer decides to use the courier named by the Vendor, they will not have to pay the costs for returns. Payment of costs to return purchased products will be made by the Vendor on the customer’s behalf, which therefore frees the customer from any obligation to make direct payment to the courier.

8.9 Refunds will be paid to the customer according to the methods and within the time stated in art. 9.2, and in any case, no later than fourteen (14) days from the date on which the Vendor was informed of the intention to use the right of withdrawal.

If this is not the case, the Vendor may keep the items, as well the sums paid for their purchase.

**9\. Refund time and method**

9.1 After the product has been returned, the Vendor will make the necessary checks of the conformity of the items under the conditions and terms stated in section 8. In case the checks are positive, the Vendor will commence the process to make the refund to the customer. In case the checks are not positive, the Vendor will inform the customer, by email, of the reduction in the value of the returned items, due to failure by the customer to comply with the conditions in section 8.7. At the same time, the Vendor will inform the customer that the amount will be deducted from the purchase price paid by the customer for the returned items and will make a partial refund, without prejudice to the alternative, which is to accept, at their own expense, the items in the same condition as returned to the Vendor and according to that stated in the above section 8.10.

9.2 Whatever method of payment used by the customer, the refund, whether full or partial, will be processed by the Vendor in the smallest possible amount of time, according to art 56, subsection III of the Consumer Code, and in any case, within fourteen (14) days from the date on which the Vendor was informed of the customer’s intention to exercise the right of withdrawal and the check of returned items. 

9.3 The Vendor will make the refund in euro, using the same method of payment as used by the customer to make the purchase. When there is no correspondence between the recipient of the item stated on the order form and the person who paid for the purchase, the sum will be refunded by the Vendor, in case of exercise of the right of withdrawal, to the person who made the purchase.

9.4 The Vendor will state the courier to use to return items (UPS, DHL, etc.). Using a courier service, stating the authorisation number for the return, as provided by the Vendor, the customer may return items to the Vendor without paying the additional costs directly. According to the methods and terms set out for exercise of the right of withdrawal, this method will allow Vendors to make direct payment, on the customer’s behalf, of the costs for returning the purchased items, freeing them of all obligation to make direct payment to the courier.
