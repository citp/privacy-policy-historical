In an effort to reduce the amount of data we gather and to no longer store email addresses and passwords, we offer single sign-on solutions for account login on some of our websites. As a result, third-parties including Github, Facebook and Google may receive information when you elect to use them. When Linux Mint shares your personal information and other collected information with third party service providers, we require that they use your information only for the purpose of providing services to us and that their terms are consistent with this privacy policy.
