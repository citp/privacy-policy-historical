<p>
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its rules (collectively, "COPPA") require us to inform you, as parents and legal guardians (as used in this section, "parents") about our practices for collecting, using, and disclosing Personal Information from children under the age of 13 ("children"). It also requires us to obtain verifiable consent from a child's parent for certain collection, use, and disclosure of the child's Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
This section notifies parents of:
</p>
<p>
The types of information we may collect from children.<br>
How we use the information we collect.<br>
Our practices for disclosing that information.<br>
Our practices for notifying and obtaining parents' consent when we collect Personal Information from children, including how a parent may revoke consent.
</p>
<p>
All operators that collect or maintain information from children through our website.
This section only applies to children under the age of 13 and supplements our general privacy policy. Only the other provisions of this Privacy Policy applies to teens and adults.
</p>
<p>
<b>Information We Collect from Children.</b> Children can access some parts of our website and its content and use some of its features without providing us with Personal Information. However, most content and features of the Services are available only to Students of the registered accounts and require us to collect certain information, including Personal Information, from them. In addition, we use certain technologies, such as cookies, to automatically collect information from our users (including children) when they visit or use the website.
</p>
<p>
We only collect as much information about a child as is reasonably necessary for the child to participate in the educational activity in our Services, and we do not condition his or her participation on the disclosure of more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary.
</p>
<p>
<b>Automatic Information Collection and Tracking.</b> We use technology to automatically collect information from our users, including children, when they access and navigate through the website and use certain features. The information we collect through these technologies may include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    One or more persistent identifiers that can be used to recognize a user over time and across different websites and online services
  </li>
  <li>
    Information that identifies a device's location (city and country).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
We may combine non-personal information we collect through these technologies with Personal Information about you or your child that we collect online.
</p>
<p>
For information about our automatic information collection practices, including how you can opt out of certain information collection, see the Cookies, Automatic Data Collection, and Related Technologies section in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
<b>How We Use Your Child's Information.</b> We use the Personal Information we collect from your child to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    register with and log in to our website
  </li>
  <li>
    We use the information we collect automatically through technology and other non-personal information we collect to improve our website and to deliver a better and more personalized experience by enabling us to:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Estimate our customer size and usage patterns.
      </li>
      <li>
        Store information about the child's preferences, allowing us to customize the content according to individual interests.
      </li>
      <li>
        Speed up your searches.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Our Practices for Disclosing Children's Information.</b> We do not share, sell, rent, or transfer children's Personal Information other than as described in this section:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
We may disclose aggregated information about many of our users, and information that does not identify any individual. In addition, we may disclose children's Personal Information:
</li>
<li>
To third parties we use to support the internal operations of our website or Services and who are bound by contractual or other obligations to use the information only for such purpose and to keep the information confidential.
</li>
<li>
  To law enforcement agencies or for an investigation related to public safety.
</li>
<li>
  If we are required to do so by law or legal process, such as to comply with any court order or subpoena or to respond to any government or regulatory request.
</li>
<li>
  If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Company, our customers or others, including to: protect the safety of a child; protect the safety and security of the website or Services; or enable us to take precautions against liability.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Accessing and Correcting Your Child's Personal Information.</b> At any time, you may review the child's Personal Information maintained by us, require us to correct or delete the Personal Information, and/or refuse to permit us from further collecting or using the child's Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
You can review, change, or delete your child's Personal Information by sending us an email to hello@lingokids.com. To protect your privacy and security, we may require you to take certain steps or provide additional information to verify your identity before we provide any information or make corrections.

<p>
  When we change or delete any Personal Information at your request, we will make good faith efforts to make the changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable. Changing setting options may not result in immediate changes to the settings, which are subject to our operations and maintenance schedules.
