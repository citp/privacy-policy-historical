          <h2>Linkatopia.com Online Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p class="p2">
          This document sets forth the Design215 Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") for this 
          Web site, www.Linkatopia.com (the "Site"). If you have objections to the Privacy Policy, 
          you should not access or use this Site. This Privacy Policy does not govern privacy 
          practices associated with offline activities or other Design215 web sites.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Collection of personal information</b><br>
          Personal information on this Site is collected by Design215 Incorporated. Design215's 
          address is 3015 North Ocean Boulevard, Suite C-115A, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33308 and its 
          telephone number is +1 954 630.3695.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Design215 will not send you any email regarding other products, services, or special 
          offers, although we may communicate with you regarding your use of the services on this 
          Site. Design215 will not provide your personal information to other companies or 
          organizations without your consent.</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>How personal information is used</b><br>
          Design215 collects your information in order to record and support your participation in 
          the activities you select. If you subscribe to a service, the information is used to 
          register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made 
          available to registered users.<br>
          <br>
          Design215 may collect information about the use of the Site, such as the types of 
          services used and how many users we receive daily. This information is collected without 
          identifying any user individually. Design215 may use this non-identifying statistical 
          data for statistical analysis, marketing, or similar promotional purposes.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Service announcements</b><br>
          On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement.  
          For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send 
          all registered users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications,
          but they are not promotional in nature.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Legal Responsibility</b><br>
          Design215 may provide your personal information if necessary, in Design215's good faith 
          judgement, to comply with laws or regulations of a governmental or regulatory body or 
          in response to a valid subpoena, warrant, or order or to protect the rights of Design215 
          or others.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Protection of your personal information</b><br>
          The personal information that you provide in connection with registering yourself as a 
          user of Design215 products or services is classified as Registration Information. 
          Registration Information is protected in several ways. Access by you to your 
          Registration Information is available through a password and unique customer ID 
          selected by you. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.<br>
          <br>
          Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online,
          for example in a chat room, that information can be collected and used by others. In 
          short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may 
          receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Links to other sites</b><br>
          This Site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Design215 is not 
          responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to 
          be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and 
          every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy 
          statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Use of cookies</b><br>
          When you visit this Site, you can browse the Site and access important information 
          without revealing your identity. In order to improve our Site, we may use "cookies" to 
          track your visit. A cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser 
          by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as 
          your identification card, and enables Design215 to record your passwords, purchases, and 
          preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.<br>
          <br>
          Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify 
          you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. 
          (For some Web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users 
          choosing not to accept cookies will probably not be able to access those pages.)<br>
          <br>
          <b>Log files</b><br>
          In addition to standard server log files, this site generates its own log 
          files. These log files provide usernames, date/time stamp, internet protocol (IP) 
          addresses, browser type, platform type, and other statistical information. None of the 
          information in Linkatopia log files is linked to personally identifiable information.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Changes in privacy policy</b><br>
          All "personal information" ("personal information" is defined as any information that 
          identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such 
          information pertains) that we collect and maintain will be subject to the version of the 
          Privacy Policy in effect at the time of such collection. Design215 reserves the right to 
          change the Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion, and will provide 
          notice of material changes on the homepage of the Site for thirty (30) days.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Business transitions</b><br>
          In the event Design215 is acquired by, or merged with, another entity, Design215 may 
          provide to such entity customer information that is related to that part of the 
          business that was sold to or merged with the other entity without your consent.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Inquiries and complaints</b><br>
