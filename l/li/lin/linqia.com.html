</ul>
<p>This log file will be stored by Linqia in the standardized combined log file format for the web server. Linqia uses the data from this log file in anonymous form without reference to User’s persona for statistical purposes.

<h5>Choices for personal information</h5>
<p>When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.</p>
<p>If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service privacy notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary service privacy notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent.</p>
<h5>Editing or deleting User’s account information / Exercising User’s rights</h5>
<p>With regard to any of User’s Personal Data provided to Linqia, User shall have the rights of access, correction, deletion and objection regarding its personal data.

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to Linqia services only.
