PERSONAL INFORMATION  
Your transaction history and the information you provide to us voluntarily on our site is stored in our customer database along with the customer information received from other sources. Some of the information we solicit, such as e-mail address, is voluntary, while much of it is required in order to fulfill your order properly.

E-MAIL POLICY  
We collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail and those who voluntarily include their e-mail addresses when ordering online. We may also collect your e-mail address if you provide it in the process of completing survey information or registering for online contests or sweepstakes. We cannot obtain your e-mail address unless you voluntarily provide it to us, or we obtain it from a service company that has confirmed your willingness to distribute it. Our Web server recognizes the computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, but not the e-mail address, for each visitor to our home page.  
Contest registrations may involve sharing your e-mail address with our promotional co-sponsors -- please see the specific contest rules & regulations for details. Additionally, if you submit your e-mail address to LC as part of a transaction originating with one of the companies we do business, the e-mail address may be shared by both LC, and the company we do business with; so therefore please see the specific privacy policy, accessible from the other company’s site, for details.
