Further information and advice about your rights can be obtained from the data protection regulator in your country of residence within the EU. You can exercise any of these rights by writing to us on the email address below in the contact us section below:

**The right to erasure**. This is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’ and, in simple terms, enables you to request the deletion or removal of your information where there is no compelling reason for us to keep using it. This is not a general right to erasure; there are exceptions.

**The right to restrict processing**. You have rights to ‘block’ or suppress further use of your information. When processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but may not use it further.

We usually act on requests and provide information free of charge but may charge a reasonable fee to cover our administrative costs of providing the information for baseless or excessive/repeated requests, or further copies of the same information.
