Our third party advertising companies may employ the use of a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons), that help them better manage content on their site by informing what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are NOT tied to users' personally identifiable information.
