		Liquidation.com, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our
		firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and
		dissemination practices for this web site: Liquidation.com.<p>

		We log your IP address, browser type, access times, and referring site to help 
		diagnose potential problems with our server, and to administer
		our Web Site. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information.</p><p>

		Our site uses cookies to keep track of your user account. We use cookies to deliver
		content specific to your interests, to save your username so you don't have to
		re-enter it each time you visit our site, and for other purposes.  
		For our site to function properly, you need to have cookies enabled.</p><p>

		Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their
		name and email address), unique identifiers (like their social security number or
		employee identification number), and business information (such as business type, expected volume and transactions).
		We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user
		information about our company and selected promotional material from some of our
		partners. Users can Opt-in to these mailings (for current deals, site updates and auction alerts). 
		Users who no longer wish to receive these emails may Opt-out of receiving future mailings; 
		see the choice/opt-out section below. 

		The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when
		necessary (for instance to verify registration information, or collect payment for transactions). 
		Business information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications
		for registration.  Unique identifiers (such as social security numbers or employee 
		identification numbers) are collected to
		verify the user's identity. Third parties may be used to verify the identity of the user.
		Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use
		this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that
		we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their
		preferences.</p><p>

		This site contains links to other sites. <b>Liquidation.com</b> is not responsible
		for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.</p><p>

		As a service to the user, the site offers a feature that allows a user to send auction details to a person via e-mail.
		The e-mail address of the recipient is used to send the auction details only and is not used again by the site.
		</p><p>

		As a service to the user, the site offers a feature that allow the user to send 
		us feedback.  This information is used to respond directly to your questions 
		or comments.  We may also file your comments to improve the site, 
		or review and discard your comments.  Your personal information is only shared 
		with explicit permission.
		</p><p>
		
		Auction information collected during the posting process is considered public information, 
		with the exception of reserve price; see "Public Forums" below.  
		The site also offers a Question and Answer message board.  
		Any information collected in this message board is considered public 
		information; see "Public Forums" below.  Although the site facilitates 
		communications between buyer and seller, 
		no information about either user is exchanged with the other.
		</p><p>
		During the transaction process, financial information (credit card or bank information) 
		is collected from the buyer to pay for the transaction.  
		The site uses a third party (Signio) to verify and process credit cards.  All information 
		exchanged with the credit card processor is encrypted.
		In addition the site will collect address information from the buyer 
		to facilitate shipping of the goods.  This address information may be 
		exchanged with our third party shipping company (Ilink Global).  
		The user may Opt-out of using Ilink Global as a shipper.
		
		</p><p>
		
		<b>Public Forums</b><br>
		This site makes message boards available to its users in connection with specific
		auctions. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas
		becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose
		your personal information.</p><p>
		
		<b>Security</b><br>
		This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of
		the information under our control. Our site uses the standard SSL (secure sockets
		layer) encryption for all sensitive data that is transmitted over the Internet. This
		includes customers adding data to the web site, and employees transmitting data off
		the web site. No information, including the passwords that would give access to
		sensitive information ever flows over the Internet un-encrypted.</p><p>

		<b>Choice/Opt-Out/Deletion</b><br>

		us or our partners at the point where we request information about the visitor, and at
		any time the user may contact us and request to have their information removed from
