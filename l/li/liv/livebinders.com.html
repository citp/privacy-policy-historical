<font size="-1">

<p>January 01, 2010</p>
<h2>LiveBinders Privacy Policy Highlights</h2>

<p>This privacy policy describes LiveBinders information gathering and
dissemination practices with respect to information we collect through our
website. This privacy policy does not govern our use of any information you
provide to us when you call us, write to us, or communicate with us in any
manner other than through our website. Because the Internet is global,
information about you that we collect or that you submit may be transferred to,
processed in, and held in countries (including the United States) other than
the one in which you reside. By using our website, you explicitly consent to
such use of your information and agree to the terms of this privacy policy.</p>
<h2>Information You Choose to Submit</h2>
<p>You can visit our website without telling us who you are or revealing any
personal information (which we will refer to in this privacy policy as
"Personal Data") about yourself. To obtain access to certain areas of
our website, however, or to receive certain services we provide (e.g., creating
a livebinder), you may be required to register with us and, in connection with such
registration, to provide certain Personal Data (e.g., your email address). We
use such information to provide the service you requested, to monitor internally
usage of our website, and to contact you from time to time about us, our website,
and our products and services. In addition, if you wish to make a purchase from
our website, you are required to register with us and, in connection with such
registration, to provide certain Personal Data (e.g., your full name, email
address, and billing information). We use such information to fulfill your order
and to contact you from time to time about us, our website, and our products and
services.</p>

<h2>Your Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
<p>LiveBinders does not claim any ownership in any of the content, including any
text, data, information, images, photographs, music, sound, video, or other
material, that you upload, transmit or store in your LiveBinders account.</p>
<h2>Information We Automatically Collect</h2>
<p>We automatically collect certain information to help us understand how
visitors use our website (which we will refer to in this privacy policy as
"Usage Data"). For example, each time you visit our website we
automatically collect your IP address, browser and computer type, access time,
the webpage from which you came, and webpage(s) that you access during your
visit. We also use cookies (which are small amounts of data sent from a web
server to your browser that are stored on your computer's hard drive) to keep
track of your use of our website, to validate your identity, to remember your
password and preferences, to tailor our website to meet your personal interests,
and to improve the quality of our website. In addition, third parties who place
advertisements on our website may also collect information through cookies to
ensure that their advertising systems and technologies work properly and to
allow them to track responses to their advertisements. Cookies set by these
third parties are governed by the privacy policies of those third parties.
Generally, you can set your browser not to accept cookies or to notify you if
you are sent a cookie, giving you the opportunity to choose whether or not to
accept the cookie. Please note that if you do set your browser not to accept
cookies, certain areas of our website may not function properly.</p>
<h2>Our Information Sharing Practices</h2>
<p>Generally, except as otherwise described in this section of our privacy
policy, we will not share your Personal Data or Usage Data with any third party
without your permission.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregated Data.</strong> From time to time, we may share aggregated
Personal Data (excluding any credit card information) and Usage Data with third
parties. We will not share any aggregated data, however, in a manner that would
enable the recipient to personally identify you. In addition, we may combine
Usage Data with Personal Data in a manner that enables us to trace Usage Data to
an individual user. We do so, however, only for our own internal business
purposes and will not share such combined data with third parties without your
permission.</p>

<p><strong>Service Providers.</strong> From time to time, we may enter into
relationships with third parties who provide services to us (e.g., credit card
processing services, shipping services, or data management and storage services).
In those circumstances, we disclose information about you that is necessary for
such service providers to perform those services, but only if such service
providers agree not to disclose your information except as necessary to perform
such services.</p>
<p><strong>Other Disclosure Scenarios.</strong> Notwithstanding anything in this
privacy policy to the contrary, we reserve the right, unless limited by
applicable law, to share any information we have collected about you or that you
have submitted: (1) in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or
to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal
claims; (2) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or
take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving
potential threats to the safety of any person or property; (3) if we believe it
is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding situations that
involve significant abuse of our website infrastructure or the Internet in
general (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to
compromise the security of information); (4) to our parent company, subsidiaries,
joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us (in which case
we will require such entities to honor this privacy policy); and (5) if we are
acquired by or merged with another entity.</p>
<h2>Public Areas</h2>
<p>Your use of areas of our website that are intended for interaction with other
users (e.g., message boards, discussion rooms, and other online forums) may
allow you to post Personal Data. By choosing to use these areas, you understand
and agree that anyone may access, use, and disclose any Personal Data that you
post to those areas.</p>
<h2>Choice/Opt-Out</h2>
<p>We offer you the opportunity to choose not to receive communications from us.
If you would like to take advantage of this opportunity, please let us know by
by accessing and updating your profile on our site or sending us an email
to privacy (at) LiveBinders (D0T) com (please send your
request from the email address associated with your account). Please note that
sometimes these requests may take up to ten business days to process and that we
are not responsible for removing information about you from the database of any
third party with which we shared your Personal Data prior to processing your
request. Even if you do take advantage of this opportunity, we reserve the right
to send you administrative messages relating to our website (e.g., about changes
to this privacy policy), to contact you regarding orders you have placed (e.g.,
order confirmations), and to share your information with our service providers
as necessary to provide service.</p>
<h2>Accessing, Correcting, and Deleting Your Personal Data</h2>

<p>If you would like to modify or delete from our database any Personal Data you
previously submitted to us, please let us know by accessing and updating your
profile on our site or by sending us an email to privacy (at) LiveBinders (D0T)
com. (please send your request from the email address associated with your
account and clearly state what Personal Data you would like modified or deleted).
Please note that sometimes these requests may take up to ten business days to
process, that any Personal Data that we have copied may remain in back-up storage
for some period of time after your request, and that if you delete certain
information (e.g., your billing address or credit card number) you may not be
able to purchase products in the future without re-submitting such information.
Also, please note that we will maintain information about you in our database
whenever we are required to do so by law.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We have implemented reasonable measures to help protect your Personal Data
from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access or disclosure. Unfortunately, however,
no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As
a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee
its security.</p>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>Our website may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for
the privacy practices of any such other website (whether accessed through an
advertisement, service, or content link) and urge you to review such practices
prior to submitting any personal information to such websites.</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If under any such update
we make any material change to the way in which we treat your Personal Data or
Usage Data, we will inform you of such change via email or by posting a notice
on relevant areas of our website. Any updated version of this privacy policy will
be effective as of the date set forth therein.</p>
