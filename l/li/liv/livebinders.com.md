May 25, 2018

## LiveBinders Privacy Policy

The following Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy” or “privacy policy”) governs our storage and use of the information you provide to us during your use of the LiveBinders (DOT) com website, and all content, services and/or products available thereon (collectively, the "Services.").

This privacy policy describes LiveBinders’ information gathering and dissemination practices with respect to information we collect through our Services. Because the Internet is global, information about you that we collect or that you submit may be transferred to, processed in, and held in countries (including the United States) other than the one in which you reside. By using our Services, you explicitly consent to such use of your information and agree to the terms of this privacy policy.

## Information You Choose to Submit

You can use our Services without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information (which we will refer to in this privacy policy as "Personal Data") about yourself. To obtain access to certain areas of our Services, however, or to receive certain services we provide (e.g., creating a livebinder, installing an application, upgrading to a premium service), you may be required to register with us and, in connection with such registration, to provide certain Personal Data (e.g., your full name, email address, billing information). We use such information to provide you with the services and features you requested or registered for, and to monitor internally the usage of our Services. We also use such information to fulfill your order and to contact you from time to time about us, about your support questions, about our website, and about our products and services. 

  * **Registration:** If you desire to have access to restricted sections of our Services, you may be required to become a registered user, and to submit any of the following: email, username, password, district, school, company name, city. Note: We encrypt your passwords.
  * **Customer Support:** We may collect information through your communications with our customer support team or other communications that you may send us and their contents.
  * **Temporary Passwords:** You may request a temporary password to be sent to the email on your account. It is your responsibility to change your password once you log in. We delete temporary passwords.
  * **Email Notifications:** You must opt-in to receive email notifications regarding marketing communications about products, services, offers, programs and promotions of LiveBinders and affiliated companies. To change your opt-in status please go to the Email Notifications box from your My Profile page. Even if you do opt-out of email notifications, we reserve the right to send you administrative messages relating to our Services (e.g., about changes to this privacy policy, maintenance issues), to contact you regarding orders you have placed (e.g., order confirmations), and to share your information with our service providers as necessary to provide you with the Services.
  * **Purchase or Upgrade:** When you make payments through the Service, you will need to provide Personal Data such as a credit card number and billing address. We use a 3rd party service to process your payments and do not store your credit card information. We require these third parties to maintain the privacy and security of the Personal Data they process on our behalf.
  * **Social Media Posts:** We offer you the ability to post your LiveBinder links directly to your social media account. In order to allow you to post to your social media platforms, we may direct you to their log in page to provide username, account IDs, social handle and email address. We refer you to their Privacy policies for handling your login credentials.
  * **Access to Connected Storage Sites:** We give you the opportunity to connect content from other third party media storage sites. Please refer to **_"Information We Get From Connected Social Media Partners"_** section below.

We also take measures to delete your Personal Data or keep it in a form that does not permit identifying you when this information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we process it, unless we are required by law to keep this information for a longer period. When determining the retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of product and services requested by or provided to you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, possible re-enrollment with our products or services, the impact on the services we provide to you if we delete some information from or about you, mandatory retention periods provided by law and the statute of limitations.

We employ administrative and electronic measures designed to appropriately protect your Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Data in our possession. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot ensure or warrant that information about you will not be accessed, viewed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our administrative, physical and electronic safeguards, subject to requirements under applicable law to guarantee information.

We will make any legally-required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted, electronically stored Personal Data to you via email or conspicuous posting on our website in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system, and any other discloures that may be required under applicable law.

If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has a registered account for the Services or that we have received any Personal Data of that child without your consent, then you may alert us through your school administrator and have them contact us at info (at) livebinders (DOT) com and request that we delete that child’s Personal Data and/or account from our systems.
