LiveAquaria.com is very sensitive to the issues of online privacy and electronic security. As we establish and maintain an online relationship with you, we want you to know we will always do whatever possible to ensure a secure and private environment to maintain your unquestioned trust.

**Privacy Policy**  
At LiveAquaria.com, we are committed to honoring and respecting your individual privacy. The following paragraphs describe our privacy policies regarding the personal information you provide us as well as information we collect about how our visitors use our site. 

**Personal Information**  
When placing your first order on LiveAquaria.com, you will be asked to provide billing and shipping information which will be stored securely and used to process your order. Your information will then be pre-filled for your convenience on future orders. If you choose, we can also pre-fill your credit card information on subsequent orders. 

The information you supply is protected by your personal Password, along with your User ID, so that only you have access to your account information. You are free to review or change your account information at any time by clicking on the My Account link at the top of each page. 

**E-mail**  
We believe that your email address is private information and you have our assurance that we do not rent or sell your email address to anyone. We use your email address to send you order-related emails, like shipping confirmations, as well as informational/sale newsletters. 

_We will always try to contact you by phone if we have a question about an order you placed. If we are unable to reach you by phone, we may also try to contact you by email._

You may opt out at any time from any or ALL email newsletters, either online or by using the links provided in every newsletter issue.

**Secure Shopping**  
[](https://www.scanalert.com/RatingVerify?ref=liveaquaria.com) All orders on our site are encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology - one of the most prevalent and secure systems available online. SSL is an extremely complex form of cryptography that makes it virtually impossible for a third party to decrypt any personal information you provide. You can rest assured that your personal and credit card information is protected when transmitted online. You can find detailed information about SSL technology and how it works online using any of the search engines. A good place to start is by visiting [Webopedia's discussion on SSL](http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/S/SSL.html). 

**Cookies**  
We use computer "cookies" only to assist us in identifying our valued returning customers and tracking items placed in their shopping carts. We store an identification number in your cookie that is only significant to LiveAquaria.com. No personal information is stored in your cookie. If you attempt to shop and have cookies disabled, we will not be able to remember items you have placed in your shopping cart. 

**JavaScript**  
We use JavaScript for many useful features such as instantly displaying backordered items, recalculating your order total when selecting a different shipping method and for displaying pop-up information for products and assistance throughout our site. Having JavaScript enabled isn't a requirement for using our site. However, these features are designed to enhance your online shopping experience and to make shopping online more convenient for you.
