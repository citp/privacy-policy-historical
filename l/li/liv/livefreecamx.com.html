<h1>Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy</h1>
<p>This Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy (the "Policy") dated May 22, 2018 replaces all previous policies.
Please take the time to review before you continue to use our products and services.</p>

this Policy, you must not use our products and services and not otherwise provide us with your information.</p>
<h2>About us</h2>

and developing our business.</p>
<h3>Payment Processing</h3>
<p>Please note that we contract with various third parties to carry out payment processing in connection with any
purchases you may make through the Site. The processing and storage of any and all information you may provide to
any such third-party payment processor, including information they may collect from you, is not governed by this
Policy. You will need to review the Privacy and Cookie Policy for such third party on their website.</p>
<h3>Two Factor Authentication</h3>
<p>When you enable two factor authentication to protect your account, you may provide your phone number directly to
a third party called Twilio. Their use of this information is outside of this Policy; however they do not receive
any information regarding your account beyond the phone number you provide directly to them.</p>
<h3>Fraud Prevention Services</h3>
<p>We use third party services in connection with preventing fraud and other damage to our system. As such we may
provide to such services with your IP and device data should your account be terminated for fraud or behavior

<h2>Certain Information Use Out of Our Control</h2>
<p>Should you determine to stream or upload any content to our Site, you understand that we cannot control the use
of such content by any user/observer of our Site. Furthermore, we cannot control the use of any personal

discussing your location, name, account information, and other identifying information. For privacy, we recommend
using a unique username not in any way tied to any of your social media accounts or real name.</p>
<h2>How we may share your information</h2>
<p>Your username will be associated with all activities you undertake on the Site including, without limitation,
messages sent, content shared, and streamed content. Your gender information will be used to categorize your account
and the content that you share so it is easier for site users to find. Your IP addresses, device data, and other use
information is used by us in order to optimize our site for use. Your usage history may also be used to help our
internal algorithm to recommend other Site users to you. Your "pay to" information, if provided to us, will be
shared with third parties (such as, by way of example only, our bank) only as necessary to process payments to you
using the "pay to" information you have provided to us. Your government identification, if provided to us, will be
shared as required to comply with applicable law and as may be requested by you in writing. Notwithstanding the
forgoing, we reserve the right to share any and all account information with law enforcement or agencies authorized
by applicable governmental authorities either in response to their written request or should we believe, in our sole
discretion, that you or your account may be involved with illegal activity, or if we determine in our sole discretion
that such disclosure is necessary to protect the rights or property of Chaturbate, our users, or third parties.</p>
<h2>Safeguards and security for your information</h2>

as by using encryption technology.</p>
<h2>Information Deletion</h2>
<p>Should you request your personal data be deleted, it will be deleted in compliance with our data retention policy and
applicable law and rules. In order to avoid abuse of our system, we will retain device and IP data relating to your
account for a period of time to prevent you from creating a new account.</p>
<p>You can request permanent deletion using our deletion tool <a href="/security/privacy/delete/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Cookies Policy</h2>
<p>You should be aware that when you use the Site we may collect information using cookies or similar technologies.</p>
<h3>What are cookies and how do they work?</h3>
<p>Cookies are small files that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Your browser
sends these cookies back to the website every time you visit the site again, so it can recognize you. This allows
websites to tailor what you see on the screen.</p>
<h3>Do we use other technologies which are similar to cookies?</h3>
<p>Our websites, apps and emails often contain small invisible images known as 'web beacons' or 'tracking pixels'. These
are used in a way similar to cookies, to understand when a particular part of a webpage is viewed. Our apps often use
device identifiers in the same way as cookies. A device identifier is a unique number on your device which allow us
to remember your device.</p>
<h3>What do we use cookies for?</h3>
<p>Cookies make using websites much smoother and affect lots of the useful features of websites. There are many
different uses for cookies, but they fall into four main groups:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Cookies that are needed to provide the service you have asked for. Some cookies are essential so you can move
around the website and use its features. Without these cookies, services you've asked for can't be provided.
These cookies gather information about you that can be used for remembering your browsing history or allowing
you to stay logged in during your visit.</li>
<li>Cookies used to improve your browsing experience. These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make,
such as your language or region and they provide improved features such as content provider recommendations and
limiting the number of times a particular advertisement is shown to you.</li>
<li>Cookies used to understand how people use our products and services. This allows us to keep track of what
pages are popular to help other users find such pages.</li>
<li>Cookies used to show advertising that is relevant to you based upon your viewing history.</li>
</ol>
<p>We also use cookies in order to know how many advertisements we serve, how many times these are clicked or hovered
over with a mouse cursor, how many advertisements we show to a given user and how many customer actions these
generate.</p>
<p>We may also use cookies on the Site and advertisers' sites to understand which customers reach a sale or other
action page on an advertiser's site. This allows us to monitor how effective our advertising is.</p>
<p>Some of our web pages will contain promotional links to other companies' sites. If you follow one of these links and
then register with or buy something from that other site, a cookie is sometimes used to tell that other site that you
came from one of our sites. That other site may then pay us a small amount for the successful referral. You will
need to review the privacy policy of any website whose advertisement you click on as this Policy only applies to
pages on our domain.</p>
<h2>Contacting us and accessing your personal information</h2>
<p>If you have any queries or comments about this Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy please contact us at:<br>
<a href="mailto:support@chaturbate.com">support@chaturbate.com</a></p>
<p>If you wish to review or receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you, we offer a self-serve tool <a href="/security/privacy/data_export/" style="text-decoration: underline">here</a>, else please write to us at:</p>

<p>We reserve the right to charge an administration fee in relation to fulfilling a request for access to personal
information which fee shall not exceed the maximum fee allowed by law.</p>
<h3>Changes to this Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy</h3>

will become effective as of the updated effective date. Your continued use of our website or platform will signify
