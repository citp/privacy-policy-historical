* ### Marketing Communications

When you sign up to receive any of our newsletters or marketing communications we will use the information you provide us, usually just your name and email address, to enable us to send you our newsletters, restaurant deals or any other communications you’ve requested. We will process your personal information for email marketing purposes based on your consent. Marketing communications are received directly from your local Bookatable company and that local Bookatable company acts as the Data Controller for marketing purposes. Bookatable local companies do not share your personal information for marketing purposes with any other company within the Bookatable Group.

Don’t’ worry, if you decide at any point that you no longer want to receive these emails, you can unsubscribe at any time. There are a number of ways you can do this: (i) there is always an unsubscribe option at the bottom of each marketing communication we send to you; and (ii) you can also contact us by email or letter using any of the contact details set out in this notice.

We will generally send you marketing communications until you choose to unsubscribe from receiving them. However, if we have not heard from you for a while or notice that you have not opened our emails in a period of 24 months, we will remove your details from our database. There’s nothing stopping you from subscribing again at any time.

If you have signed up to any of our services or booked a restaurant through us, you will still receive emails relating to those services and bookings (e.g. confirmation emails, reminder emails). If you decide not receive marketing emails from us, it will not affect service emails which are integral to the services provide to you by us and the Restaurants.

From time to time we may also use your Usage and Device Data to make online suggestions and recommendations to you about goods or services that may be of interest to you. This is necessary for the legitimate interest of our business in developing our products and services and growing our business.

#### Marketing from Restaurants and Partner Networks

* ### Our relationship with Restaurants

While we generally act as a data controller when you use our services directly, when you use our websites or mobile apps, we provide our booking services to the third parties for example, restaurants. When we provide our services to restaurants, for example, where a restaurant uses our booking platform on their own website, the restaurants engage us as a service provider. This means that we are not the data controller and we act as a data processor on behalf of the restaurants. We are not in control of any information where a restaurant acts as a data controller and you should ensure that you review each restaurant’s privacy policy where applicable.

* ### Where we store your personal information

All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers within UK or EEA. Unless you are told otherwise in any specific privacy notices provided by us, we do not transfer any personal information outside the EEA.

While we are committed to keeping your personal information secure, the transmission of information online via the internet is not completely secure. We, together with our service providers will do our best to protect your personal information but information provided is at your sole risk.

We only share your personal data with people who have a need to know such information to perform their responsibilities.  
We may share your personal information with the following:

  * **Restaurants** \- we share Booking Data, reviews, where applicable Payment Data and other relevant information you provide us with the Restaurants that you request services from. This information is provided to the Restaurants to enable them to continue to process and manage your booking. Once we pass your information to the Restaurant, the Restaurant takes the role of Data Controller and we become the Data Processor.
  * **Partner Networks** – where you book a Restaurant through one of our Partner Networks, for example a third party restaurant reservation website, we share Booking Data, reviews and other relevant information you provide us with that Partner Network. We will never share Payment Data with Partner Networks. Once we pass your information to the Partner Network, the Partner Network takes the role of Data Controller for that data.
  * **Payment and billing providers** – to make a reservation at some restaurants, you are required to make a deposit or provide your credit or debit card information to secure your reservation. In order to process this information we share this Payment Data with third party payment and billing service providers.
  * **Within the Bookatable Group** \- we may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries to the extent necessary for the same purposes of the initial processing set out in this policy. 

For example, we will share your Booking Data with your local Bookatable company (e.g. the company in which you reside and make the booking from), we also may share your Booking Data with one of our group companies in a different country if you make a booking through our UK website for a Restaurant based in that other country.

    * If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Bookatable Group, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
    * In order to manage risks and legal disputes and obtaining professional legal advice. This disclosure will be on a confidential basis and only to our professional advisors who are under a duty of confidentiality.


* ### How long will personal information be kept by us

As a rule, we will not hold your personal information for any purpose or purposes for longer than is necessary to fulfil the purposes we collect it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. For more specific retention periods, please see section 5 above. While we do everything we can to comply with these retention periods, if there is a legal, accounting or tax reason why the information is to be held for longer, we will only retain the information for as long as necessary to satisfy that legal, accounting or tax reason.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
