Livemercial Network reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes to our Privacy Policy will be posted on this website and the effective date of the policy will be modified to reflect the effective date of the most recent version.

Livemercial Network will utilize service providers who assist us with our marketing efforts, but those service providers will not use any PII collected by third-party marketing partners and managed by Livemercial Network for their own marketing purposes and are prohibited by contract from sharing that PII with any party other than Livemercial Network. These businesses may include, but are not limited to: providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation services.

For PII collected from consumers inside the European Union, Livemercial Network will not manage that consumer data unless that consumer first requested, pursuant to clear and conspicuous notice, to receive such types of marketing communications. Moreover, the EU recipient must be given clear and conspicuous notice that the data is going to be shared with third parties for marketing purposes, and that notice must be given prior to receipt of the recipient's permission.

**Choice**  
Livemercial Network manages e-mail lists through its List Management Arrangements. Consumers may wish to remove themselves from specific Livemercial Network marketing lists. As such, users may remove themselves from a specific mailing list by utilizing the list-unsubscribe option that is present and available at the end of each e-mail that Livemercial Network sends.

Moreover, consumers may elect not to receive advertisements from a specific advertiser at any time. In every e-mail communication we send, there is also an unsubscribe hyperlink that allows the recipient to unsubscribe from receiving commercial emails from that specific advertiser by clicking the hyperlink provided and following the instructions provided. We process all unsubscribe requests in a prompt fashion.

Unsubscribe requests are either processed on an advertiser-specific basis or on a list-specific basis, depending on the selection the consumer makes. Unsubscribing from one list managed by Livemercial Network will not remove the consumer from all Livemercial Network marketing lists. Similarly, unsubscribing from one advertiser will not prevent the consumer from receiving all advertisers' emails.

Our web beacons do not collect PII. Users wishing to disable our web beacons should do so by turning images “off” in their email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express). Please see your email client for more information.
