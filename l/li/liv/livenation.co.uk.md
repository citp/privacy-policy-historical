### Privacy Policy 

This Policy explains what personal information [Live Nation and its group](http://www.livenation.co.uk/about) (known in this Policy as “ **we** ” or “ **Live Nation** ”) collect both online (including through apps) and offline and how we use it. Please read it carefully. 

Generally, we collect information about you if you create an account, from your purchase of tickets, when you email or call us, or from box office purchases operated or administered by us, and when you use our websites, apps and social media or any services we may provide during our events such as cashless payment wristband. We use that and other information to provide better services, marketing and support to you and our other customers (including by analysing your information to provide you with a personalised experience). 

When you, for example, create an account, purchase tickets, download one of our apps or contact us on the phone, we may ask your consent to use your information for certain purposes. Your choices about how we use information are described here. 

Live Nation works together with various organisations to bring you the events you love. We call these organisations our Event Partners and these range from, for example, the authorised ticket agents who sell tickets on our behalf, the venues in which our events are held or the artists who we promote. The ticket agents or venues may share your information with us, for the purposes described in this privacy policy. For more detail about how we collect your information click here.
