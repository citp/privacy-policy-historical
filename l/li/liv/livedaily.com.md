* **Business partners.   **When you participate in a promotion, we may share your personal information with the merchants offering the products, services, promotions, contests and/or sweepstakes. We won’t share your personal information with these businesses unless you choose to participate in their offer or program.  When you choose to engage in a particular offer or program, we will ask you to authorize us to share your email address and other information with the relevant merchant.

  * **Other Situations.** We also may disclose your information: 
    * In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law.  In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. 
    * When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies. 
    * In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. 



We may share your non-personal information in any of the above circumstances. Also, we may share aggregated non-personal information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for general business analysis purposes. For example, we may provide our advertisers with the number of visitors to our website and the most popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any personal information. It may be used to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our website and on websites of third parties.

**Third-party websites** ****

**Third parties have their own privacy policies that govern their use of your information.    **There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites that don’t operate under this Privacy Policy.  For example, if you click on an advertisement on our website, you may be taken to a website that we don’t control.  These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you.  Importantly, these third parties will have their own privacy policies describing how they use and disclose your personal information. Those policies will govern the use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once you or we have shared it with those third parties. If you want to learn more about other entities’ privacy practices, please review the websites of those third parties.  Privacy policies are typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.

If you have any questions about how a third party handles personal information, please contact that third party directly. 

**How you can access your information**

If you have a _LiveDaily_ account, you can quickly and easily review and update your personal information online by [logging into your account](http://www.ticketmaster.com/member). You can also review and update your personal information by contacting us by regular mail or email at: 

Privacy Officer  
c/o Ticketmaster Legal  
8800 W. Sunset Blvd.  
West Hollywood, CA 90069  
[legal@ticketmaster.com](mailto:legal@ticketmaster.com)

Please note that if we have already provided information about you to third parties, or if you’ve given information to a third party (for example, by clicking on a website link taking you to a third party’s website, and you provided your contact information to that third party), retention of that information will be subject to those third parties’ policies.  If you receive an unwanted email from a third party, you’ll have to opt-out from receiving further emails from that party itself.   


**Your choices about your personal information**   
You can choose not to provide us with certain information.  However, that may result in your not being able to use certain features of our website because such information may be required in order to use those features.  For example, in order to participate in a contest, promotion or sweepstakes, your personal information will be required.  
At any time, you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails from us by signing in to your _LiveDaily_ account.  Also, in any commercial email we send, you will be given the opportunity to opt out of receiving such messages in the future by clicking on the link at the bottom of the email that says “unsubscribe.”  It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request.  
Even if you have unsubscribed from receiving promotional emails from us, we may send you other types of important e-mail communications without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.  These may include customer service announcements, administrative notices and surveys.   
Please note that changing information in your account or opting out of receiving promotional email communications will affect only future communications from us.  If we already provided your information to a third party before you changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change your preferences directly with that third party as well.  
**Blogs, bulletin boards, reviews and chat rooms**

We provide areas on our website where you can post information about yourself, communicate with others, post reviews or upload content (e.g. pictures, videos, audio files, etc.). Such postings are governed by our [Terms of Use](http://www.ticketmaster.com/h/terms.html), so be sure to review them before posting.  In addition, keep in mind that postings may appear on other websites or when searches are conducted on search engines on the subject of your posting.  

Also, whenever you disclose personal information publicly (such as on publicly viewable web pages), that information becomes public and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited email messages.  We can’t control who reads your posting or what others may do with information you voluntarily post, so  we encourage you to use your discretion with respect to posting personal information.

**Children’s privacy**

Our website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

**Visiting our website from outside the United States**

This Privacy Policy covers the collection of information on our website from U.S. residents. If you are visiting our website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. 

U.S. data protection and other laws may not be as comprehensive as those in your country.  Please be assured that we take steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. 

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services.  When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the “last updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy.  If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will notify you by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address you most recently provided us in your account, and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our website. We recommend that you check our website from time to time to remain updated as to any changes in our privacy or other policies.

**Your California Privacy Rights**

If you are a California resident, you have the right to request information about how we share certain categories of personal information with third parties. California law gives you the right to send us a request at a designated address to receive the following information:

  * the categories of information we disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year; 
  * the names and addresses of the third parties that received that information; and
