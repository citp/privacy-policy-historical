<h1>Privacy Policy </h1>
<p>Your privacy is important to LiveOps. This statement describes how LiveOps handles and views the personal information of visitors to the LiveOps websites.</p>

<h2>Collection of Personal Information</h2>
<p>Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including but not limited to, a first and last name, a national identification number, an email address, postal or physical address or other contact information, occupation, industry or other information including market questions needed to answer a request, to better provide information and services or to comply with various national, state, provincial or local government reporting requirements.</p>
<p>The submission of personal information is voluntary. LiveOps may collect personal information as described below. In each case, we only collect personal information that we believe to be relevant and required to provide an individual with requested information and services and to conduct our business. LiveOps may collect personal information for purposes that include but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Viewing/accessing of white papers, technical briefs or product/service offering demonstrations</li>
<li>Participation in marketing promotions, events, seminars, webinars, podcasts, teleconferences, executive roundtables, direct mail or general marketing</li>
<li>Career opportunities or other Human Resources activities</li>
<li>Opportunities to become certified as a LiveOps Agent</li>
<li>User surveys</li>
<li>Use of our websites specifically for our Customers or Business Partners</li>
<li>Responding to a formal inquiry</li>
<li>In addition, when accessing certain documents or services on our website, visitors may be asked to provide certain information, such as how they can be contacted, where they work, and what they do. We may also track non-personal information (also see Use of Cookies, Web Beacons and other Technologies in this Privacy Policy Statement) about web pages and content accessed by visitors to LiveOps’ website and the number of times such content is accessed by a specific visitor. LiveOps collects this non-personal information in an effort to improve the quality of its website and also to answer questions as well as improve delivery and quality of information to visitors of the LiveOps websites.</li>
</ul>

<h2>LiveOps Discussion Forums and Chat Rooms</h2>
<p>If you participate in a LiveOps discussion forum or chat room, you should be aware that the information you provide there will be made broadly available to others, potentially inside or outside LiveOps, who have access to that discussion forum or chat room. Also, please recognize that individual forums and chat rooms may have additional rules and conditions. Each participant's opinion on a forum or chat room is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of LiveOps.</p>

<h2>Third Party Sites</h2>
<p>LiveOps’ websites may, from time to time, provide links to other third party websites which are outside our control and not covered by this Policy and may be different from this Policy. You may wish to review the privacy policies posted on all third party websites.</p>

<h2>Privacy of Minors and Children</h2>
<p>Our websites do not and will not target and are not intended to solicit or attract children. LiveOps does not knowingly solicit personal information from children or send them requests for personal information. For the purposes of this document, children means anyone under the age of 13.</p>

<h2>Use of Suppliers</h2>
<p>In some cases LiveOps uses suppliers to collect, use, analyze and otherwise process information on its behalf. It is LiveOps' practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with LiveOps policies.</p>

<h2>Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies</h2>
<p>We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our websites to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on LiveOps Web sites, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable. This information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." LiveOps or others on LiveOps' behalf may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service.</p>
<p>Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about that transaction in a non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information such as clickstream data. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns. This information is not reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner you can disable your cookies.</p>
<p>We collect the information we mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the use of various technologies, including "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. Some LiveOps pages use cookies, sent by LiveOps or its third party vendors, or other technologies to better serve you when you return to the website. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some of our websites may not work properly.</p>
<p>Some LiveOps websites also use Web beacon or other technologies to better tailor those sites to provide better customer service. These technologies may be in use on a number of pages across LiveOps' websites. When a visitor accesses these pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our suppliers. These Web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies. If you don't want your cookie information to be associated with your visits to these pages, you can set your browser to turn off cookies.</p>
<p>If you turn off cookies, Web beacon and other technologies will still detect visits to these pages, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable cookie information and are disregarded.

</p><h2> Service Quality Monitoring</h2>
<p>Certain Web transactions may also involve you calling us or our calling you. Please be aware that it is LiveOps' general practice to monitor and in some cases record such calls for training or quality assurance purposes.</p>

<h2> Online Advertising</h2>
<p>Although we do not present online advertising on our Web site today, we may engage certain companies to help us deliver interactive on-line advertising such as banner ads. These companies may collect and use information about customers.</p>

<h2> Notification of Changes</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on January 17, 2008. A notice will be posted on our website home page for 30 days whenever this Policy is changed in a material way.</p>

<h2> Privacy Questions and Access</h2>
<p>If you have a question about this statement, you can send an email to the LiveOps website coordinator at privacy@liveops.com. You can also contact us at this address if you have a question about LiveOps' handling of your information.</p>
<p>If you wish to obtain a copy of particular information you provided to LiveOps, or if you become aware the information is incorrect and you would like us to correct it contact us at privacy@liveops.com.</p>
<p>Before LiveOps is able to provide you with any information or correct any inaccuracies, however, we may ask you to verify your identity and to provide other details to help us to respond to your request. We will endeavor to respond within an appropriate timeframe.</p>
