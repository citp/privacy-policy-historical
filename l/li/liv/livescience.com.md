Privacy Statement

**

Welcome to the Imaginova Corp. ("Imaginova") web properties, including the web sites Space.com, StarryNight.com, LiveScience.com, Telescope.com, SpaceNews.com, and Imaginova.com (the "Sites") all of which are owned and operated by Imaginova. Imaginova has created this Privacy Statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Sites. This Statement applies only to information collected through the Sites and not to information collected offline or through other web sites owned or operated by Imaginova. 

**

Information We Collect

**

There are two kinds of information web sites can obtain about you: "Anonymous Information" and "Personally Identifiable Information". 

"Anonymous Information" is aggregate data that web sites use to administer their sites. For example, an IP address is unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our Sites. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and your shopping cart. 

Our Sites also use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to make sure you do not see the same advertisements repeatedly. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit one or more of our Sites. 

Some of the advertisements appearing on the Sites are delivered by third parties, such as Atlas DMT. and DoubleClick. In the course of serving advertisements to the Sites, Atlas DMT, Inc. and DoubleClick may place or recognize a unique "cookie" in your browser’s cache, and may use anonymous information (including date/time of the banner ad displayed, the ad that was displayed and the IP address of the visitor) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you and to collect statistical information. If you would like to learn more about Atlas DMT’s information gathering practices, or if you would like to "opt-out" of having a unique cookie placed on your hard drive by Atlas DMT, please click _here_. If you would like more information about DoubleClick's information gathering practices, and to know your choices about not having this information used by DoubleClick, please click _here_. 

"Personally Identifiable Information" is any information that personally identifies you, such as your name, email address or your telephone number. Sometimes this personal information is needed when you place an order, subscribe to our email newsletter, or when you contact us. In addition, we may ask you to provide us with personal information on a voluntary basis in certain areas of our Sites. 

Personally Identifiable Information collected through our Sites may be used for purposes, including administration of the Sites, order processing and communications with you. For example, some of our Sites use an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like email addresses) and financial information (like account or credit card numbers). Customer contact information may be used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Credit card information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. Contact information from the order form is also used to send orders and information about Imaginova and its Sites to our customers. 

We may use this information to maintain your account and send you announcements of new Site features, special offers and promotional material that we think may be of interest to you. In all cases, however, we will only use your information as permitted by law. We may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights and property; (c) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site; or (d) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public. Please note that we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases. 

**

Disclosure of Information Through Business Transfers

**

As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses, and in so doing, acquire customer information. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. Similarly, in the event that a portion or substantially all of Imaginova’s assets are sold or transferred to a third party, customer information (including your email address) would likely be one of the transferred business assets.

**

Third Party Web Sites

**

The Sites contain links to third party web sites not owned or controlled by Imaginova. Imaginova is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third party web sites. Inclusion of any linked web site on any of our Sites does not imply or express an approval or endorsement of the linked web site by us, or of any of the content, opinions, products or services provided on these web sites. Even if an affiliation exists between Imaginova and a third-party web site, we exercise no control over linked sites. Each of these linked sites maintains its own independent privacy and data collection policies and procedures. If you visit a web site that is linked to from one of our Sites, we encourage you to consult that web site's privacy policy before providing any personal information and whenever interacting with any web site.

**

Public Forums

**

Our Sites may makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or newsgroups available to users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

**

Security

**

Our Sites have reasonable security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Security of information communicated by or to us over the Internet is of utmost concern to us; however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that your email, like most, if not all, non-encrypted Internet communications, may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users, without your knowledge and permission, while in transit to us. For that reason, to protect your privacy, please do not use email to communicate information to us that you consider confidential. While we strive to protect your personal information, Imaginova cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or through this our Sites. Once we receive your transmission, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our internal systems. Depending on the nature of the inquiry, your communication may be discarded or archived. 

**

Choice/Opt-Out

**

Our Sites provide users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us and/or our partners at the point where we request information about the visitor. If you do not opt-out at that time, but later decide that you do not wish to receive future communications from us, you may remove your information from our database and from our mailing list by entering the exact email address where you are currently receiving email from Imaginova.

**
