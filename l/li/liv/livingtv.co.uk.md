### COOKIES

You should be aware that information on you may be collected through the use of cookies, when you use Sky websites and/or selected third party sites. Some cookies are essential for us to use in order to provide you with the services you have requested. When using Sky websites you agree to the use of the non-essential cookies unless you set your browser to reject them (see below).

 

### What is a cookie?

A cookie is a small file, which is placed on your device when you visit a website or open certain emails.

 

### How does Sky use cookies?

We use information from cookies for purposes which may include:

  * Identifying you when you sign in to My Sky, allowing you to see a customised version of Sky websites and eliminating the need for you to re-enter your log-in details;
  * tracking your use of Sky websites to better develop them (for example, working out which parts of the website are more popular and developing our content accordingly);
  * unless you have opted out, serving behavioural and tailored advertising on Sky online services and websites and selected third party websites, including by combining Sky cookie data with selected third party cookie data, which means you may receive advertisements which are more relevant to you.

 

### How do I manage or refuse cookies?

If you do not want information to be collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookies feature. Please note, however, that there may be some deterioration in the service you receive (for example, you may not be able to access online content such as Sky Player or undertake self-service activities).
