# Privacy & Policy - Livemint

HT Media Ltd and our affiliated companies worldwide are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information (personal information) you share with us 

At HT Media Ltd we collect different types of information about our users for three main reasons: 

1\. to help us to improve the services we offer 

2\. to provide personalized services unique to individual users 

3\. to use anonymous details about our users to sell appropriate advertising space on the site. This might mean showing an advertiser how many users we have on the site; it does not mean sharing an individual's details with an advertiser. Where we collect registration information from an individual, we will never share that individual’s information with a third party, including an advertiser, without that user’s explicit permission. 

Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

Some of our Web pages utilize “cookies” and other tracking technologies. A “cookie” is a text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about Web site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Web user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. 

You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to block the cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the Web site. 

Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; click stream patterns; and dates and times that our site is accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allow us to improve our Web site and your Web experience. We may also analyze information that does not contain personal information for trends and statistics. 

To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles: 

  * Notice

Notice

Where HT Media Ltd collects personal information on the Web, we intend to post a purpose statement that explains why personal information will be collected and whether we plan to share such personal information outside of HT Media Ltd or those working on HT Media Ltd’s behalf. HT Media Ltd does not intend to transfer personal information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on HT Media Ltd’s behalf unless such transfer is legally required. 

Choice

You may choose whether or not to provide personal information to HT Media Ltd. The notice we intend to provide where HT Media Ltd collects personal information on the Web should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to provide the personal information we request, you can still visit most of HT Media Ltd’s Web sites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you. 

If you chose to have a relationship with HT Media Ltd, such as a contractual or other business relationship or partnership, we will naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship. 

Security

Wherever your personal information may be held within HT Media Ltd or on its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the personal information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. 

Third Party Services

Third parties provide certain services available on scan.com on HT Media Ltd’s behalf. HT Media Ltd may provide information, including personal information that we collect on the Web to third-party service providers to help us deliver programmes, products, information, and services.

HT Media Ltd will take reasonable steps to ensure that these third-party service providers are obligated to protect personal information on HT Media Ltd’s behalf. 

HT Media Ltd does not intend to transfer personal information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on HT Media Ltd’s behalf unless such transfer is legally required. Similarly, it is against HT Media Ltd’s policy to sell personal information collected online without consent.
