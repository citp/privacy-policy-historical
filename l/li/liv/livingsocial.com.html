  <div class="privacy">

  <p>
    The LivingSocial application and the associated LivingSocial website available at www.livingsocial.com (collectively, "LivingSocial") are owned and operated by Hungry Machines, Inc. d/b/a LivingSocial ("us" "we" or "our").  At LivingSocial, you can keep track of what you like, tell others about what you like, discover new things to try, and find out what your friends enjoy, all in one place.  This LivingSocial privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any information you submit to us through LivingSocial.  This includes "Personal Information," which is information about you that is personally identifiable such as your name, e-mail address, user ID number, and other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing, as well as "Anonymous Information," which is information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information and does not permit the identification of individual persons.
  </p>

	<h2>User Consent</h2>

	  <p>By accessing or otherwise using LivingSocial, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and the associated Terms of Service (set forth on http://www.livingsocial.com/terms-of-service]) you expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information and Anonymous Information according to this Privacy Policy.</p>
	
    <p>Your Personal Information may be processed by us in the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.</p>

  <h2>Regarding Children</h2>
  
    <p>Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use LivingSocial and we do not intentionally collect or maintain Personal Information from those who are under 13 years old.  Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us.  Thus, if we obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 13, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases.  We recommend that children between the ages of 13 and 18 obtain their parent’s permission before submitting information over the internet.  By using LivingSocial, you are representing that you are at least 18 years old, or that you are at least 13 years old and have your parents’ permission to use LivingSocial.</p>
  
  <h2>Collection and Use of Information</h2>
  
    <h3>Personal Information</h3>
    <p>In general, we collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily through LivingSocial. We also collect information that you submit in the process of creating or editing your account and user profile on LivingSocial.  For example, our registration and login process requires you to provide us with your name, valid email address and password of your choice.  When you personalize your profile and use the features of LivingSocial, we will collect any information you voluntarily provide, and we may also request optional information to support your use of LivingSocial, such as your year of birth, gender and other demographic information. We collect information in the form of the content that you submit during your use of LivingSocial, such as photos, reviews, ratings and other information you choose to submit.  We may also collect information about you and your friends who use LivingSocial, from any social network you may have connected from, in order to provide you with a more personalized experience.  For instance, we may collect your user ID or profile information that you have permitted to be displayed through LivingSocial in order to display you as a friend or in association with your profile and collections.  When you order our products or services, you will need to submit your credit card  or other payment information so that our service providers can process your payment for those products and services. When you sign up for, or win, any contests, sweepstakes, or other activities that we make available on LivingSocial, we will collect the information designated along with such activity, which may include your contact information such as your address and phone number. If you choose to sign up to receive information about products or services that may be of interest to you, we will collect your email address and all related information.   Additionally, we collect any information that you voluntarily enter, including Personal Information, into any postings, comments, or forums within the LivingSocial community.</p>

    <h3>Personal Information from Other Sources</h3>
    <p>We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources with which you have registered, companies who we have partnered with (collectively, "Partners") or other third parties.  We may associate this information with the other Personal Information we have collected about you.</p>

    <h3>E-mail and E-mail Addresses</h3>
    <p>If you send an e-mail to us, or fill out our "Feedback" form through LivingSocial, we will collect your e-mail address and the full content of your e-mail, including attached files, and other information you provide.  We may use and display your full name and email address when you send an email notification to a friend through LivingSocial or the social network from which you have connected to LivingSocial (such as in an invitation, or when sharing your content). Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf of your friends (such as when someone sends you a personal message) or notifications from a social network or other website with whom you have registered to receive such notifications.  We may use this e-mail address to contact you, for things such as notifications of limited edition shop sales and other related information.  You may indicate your preference to stop receiving further promotional communications as further detailed below.</p>

    <h3>Information Collected Via Technology</h3>
    <p>As you use LivingSocial, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers’ server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on LivingSocial you clicked. This type of information is collected to make LivingSocial and solutions more useful to you and to tailor the experience with LivingSocial to meet your special interests and needs.</p>

    <p>An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.  In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session.  For example, we, or our service providers, may track your IP Address when you access LivingSocial to assist with ad targeting.</p>

    <p>"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a website.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with LivingSocial.  Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions.  In order to use our services offered through LivingSocial, your web browser must accept Cookies. If you choose to disable Cookies, some aspects of LivingSocial may not work properly, and you will not be able to receive our services.</p>

    <p>We may also enable advertisers and ad servers to promote third-party products and/or services by placing advertisements on LivingSocial.  These advertisers and ad servers may use Cookies and/or "Web Beacons" (which are usually small, transparent graphic images) in order to monitor information related to served advertisements.  Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the website of a third-party and the advertiser.  This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any advertisers or ad servers.</p>
  
  <h2>Use and Disclosure of Information</h2>
  
    <p>Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not generally sell, trade, rent, or share the Personal Information that we collect with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so.</p>

    <p>In general, Personal Information you submit to us is used by us to provide you access to LivingSocial, to improve LivingSocial, to better tailor the features, performance, and support of LivingSocial and to offer you additional information, opportunities, promotions and functionality from us, our partners or our advertisers at your request.  Additionally, we do share your content preferences and other information with the social network from which you have connected to LivingSocial, along with those companies and persons you have asked us to share your information with.</p>

    <p>We may provide your Personal Information to third-party service providers who work on behalf of or with us to provide some of the services and features of LivingSocial and to help us communicate with you. Examples of such services include sending email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments (including credit card payments), and providing customer service.   We require our third-party service providers to promise not to use such information except as necessary to provide the relevant services to us.
    We may share some or all of your Personal Information with our third-party partners, those with whom we have a co-branding or promotional relationship, or other third-parties about whom you are otherwise notified and do not request to opt out of such sharing.  This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of your personally identifiable information by such third-parties.  We do not maintain responsibility for the manner in which third parties, including, without limitation, social networks, other partners and advertisers, use or further disclose Personal Information collected from you in accordance with this Privacy Policy, after we have disclosed such information to those third parties.  If you do not want us to use or disclose Personal Information collected about you in the manners identified in this Privacy Policy, you may not use LivingSocial.</p>

    <p>Additionally, we may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that would otherwise make the Anonymous Information personally identifiable to you.  Generally, we aggregate this information and use it in statistical analysis to help us analyze patterns in the use of LivingSocial. This Privacy Policy does not limit our use or disclosure of any Anonymous Information in any way, and we reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information to our partners, advertisers and other third parties in our discretion.</p>
    
    <p>Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control, we may in the future, and we may share some or all of your Personal Information with these companies, in which case we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>In the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of ours or that acquirer’s assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect and defend our rights or property, you, or third parties.  You hereby consent to us sharing your Personal Information under the circumstances described herein.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We are committed to protecting the security of your Personal Information.
