<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">As with most other websites,
we collect and use the data contained in log files.&nbsp; The information
in the log files include&nbsp; your IP (internet protocol) address, your
ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser
you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the
time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Cookies and Web Beacons</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">We do use cookies to
store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our
site.&nbsp; This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit,
or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">We also use third party
advertisements on LiveIndia.com &amp; Subdomains* to support our site.&nbsp;
Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons
when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers
(such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including
your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and
in some cases, whether you have Flash installed.&nbsp; This is generally
used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone
in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites
visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).</font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">DoubleClick DART cookies</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">We also may use DART
cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie
on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick
advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements).&nbsp; This
cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest
based targeting”).&nbsp; The ads served will be targeted based on your
previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites
about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when
viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey).&nbsp; DART
uses “non personally identifiable information”.&nbsp; It does NOT track
personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical
address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers
or credit card numbers.&nbsp; You can opt-out of this ad serving on all
sites using this advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx">http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx</a></font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">You can choose to disable
or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser
settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet
Security.&nbsp; However, this can affect how you are able to interact with
our site as well as other websites.&nbsp; This could include the inability
to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Deleting cookies does
not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program.&nbsp;
Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit
a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.</font></font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font></font></b>
