We may also remove all the personally identifiable information and use the remaining data for historical, statistical or scientific purposes. 
            	</p>
            	</li>
            	<li>

            	</p>
            	<p>
            	This information does not identify you personally, but the registration process for the Livestation software does. 
            	</p>
            	<p>
            	We may use this information to determine from which country you are accessing the services and to determine which channels are available to you. 
            	</p>
            	<p>
            	We may also pass on your login information to a channel provider or platform operator in the case of subscription channels or premium programming to enable you to view such channels or programmes.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            	We may also store and transfer a small file known as a 'cookie' to save and maintain information and preferences while you are using the Livestation software or Website and between sessions.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            	We may also save other information on the storage system of your computer to enable the Livestation Software or Website to store preferences.
            	</p>
            	<p>
            	The Livestation Software may also be used to send us a log file when there is a problem. This log file contains information about your use of our software and technical information about your computer to enable us to diagnose problems. 
            	</p>
            	</li>
            	<li>
            	<h2>Sharing Personal Information</h2>
            	<p>
            	Livestation may share your personal information with third parties we use to perform certain services for us such as support or technical functions. We will limit the information we share and these third parties are required to use the personal information we share with them only to perform services on our behalf and to treat your personal information as strictly confidential. 
            	</p>
            	<p>
            	Livestation may also share your personal information with other Livestation businesses or with third parties who partner with us to provide products and services to our customers. In this case we will require such business units or business partners to use the personal information we share with them in a manner consistent with the purposes for which it was originally collected or to which you subsequently consented and only as permitted under this Policy and all applicable privacy and data protection laws. 
            	</p>
            	<p>
            	In certain limited circumstances we may share or transfer personal information to unrelated third parties. This may be at your request, to comply with a legal requirement or court order, to investigate a possible crime, or a matter on which we require legal advice or under similar circumstances. In such cases we will take appropriate steps to protect your personal information. 
            	</p>
            	</li>
            	<li>
            	<h2>Security of Personal Information</h2>
            	<p>
            	Livestation will maintain reasonable safeguards to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of your personal information. For example, we use encryption to protect any passwords and we restrict access to information both physically and logically. Although we use security measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorised disclosure, misuse or alteration, as is the case with all public computer networks, we cannot guarantee the security of information provided over the Internet and will not be responsible for breaches of security beyond our reasonable control. 
            	</p>
            	</li>
            	<li>
            	<h2>Links to third-party services</h2>
            	<p>
            	The Livestation Software and our Website may contain references or links to third-party services that are not operated by Livestation. These references or links are provided as a service and do not imply any endorsement of the activities or content of such services or any association with their operators. Livestation does not control such services and is not responsible for their content, security or privacy practices. You therefore access such services at your own risk.

            	</li>
            	<li>
            	<h2>Retention and deletion of Personal Information</h2>
            	<p>
            	We will retain the Personal Information we collect only as long as necessary to provide the services, products and information you request or as permitted by applicable law. We also periodically destroy information in accordance with our company policies. 
            	</p>
            	<p>
            	We aim to respond to any request for deletion of personal information within seven days. Please note that this may prevent you from using our software. Requests should be sent to the contact address listed at the end of this Policy.
