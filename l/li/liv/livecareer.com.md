1.     **_COLLECTION OF INFORMATION_ __ **

Information is collected from you, our customer, at several different points during your visit(s) to the LiveCareer Site.

_Registration_ \--Any information you provide before registering on our Site is not associated with you individually and is not retained by LiveCareer unless you register with us. If you decide to register with us, you are required to provide certain categories of information, such as name, e-mail address, a password, whether you are a student, employed, or in another category, date of birth, gender and country of citizenship. In addition, we require that you provide other categories of information, such as an area of study that interests you and career interests you have. For some products, you are required to provide other information in the form of uploaded documents as well as resume information, such as contact information, career objectives and employment history and job descriptions. LiveCareer asks for this information so that you are able to use and maximize the effectiveness of our career tools and have the best possible experience with LiveCareer. 

_Optional Information_ \--At various other points during your visit to LiveCareer, you may be asked to provide information about yourself. For example, you may wish to sign up for information about online courses relevant to your career interests. The use of other services which require the input of additional information is completely voluntary on your part. You have the choice about whether to disclose the information necessary to use these features of our Site. 

In addition, during your visit to our Site, you may be asked to provide feedback, ideas, suggestions, and/or proposals (“Contributions”) with regard to our products and services. Submission of Contributions is optional, although encouraged, as it allows LiveCareer to better address our users’ needs and continuously work towards improving our products and services. By submitting your Contributions, you acknowledge and agree that i) such Contributions do not contain confidential or proprietary information; ii) LiveCareer shall be entitled to use or disclose (or choose not to disclose) any such Contributions for any purpose, in any way, in any media worldwide; iii) you irrevocably assign to LiveCareer all rights to your Contributions; iv) LiveCareer is not under any obligation of confidentiality, express or implied, with respect to the Contributions; and v) you are not entitled to any compensation or reimbursement of any kind from LiveCareer under any circumstances for submission of your Contributions. 

_Credit Card information_ —While many products and services on our Site are provided free, some require payment from you by credit card. To the extent we collect credit card information, we do not share that information with any third parties except to the extent necessary to complete a transaction. We also do not store complete credit card information (meaning we do not store your entire credit card number) unless you ask us to in connection with a subscription-based product. All credit card information is removed from our systems at your request. We also use a third party payment service to process your credit card transactions and any information you provide through that third party payment service will be subject to its privacy policy. **PLEASE NOTE THAT OUR PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT GOVERN INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE THIRD PARTY PAYMENT SERVICE.**

_Passive Collection of Information_ \--In addition to the information which you actively provide to LiveCareer by, for example, completing the registration form, LiveCareer collects information about how you interact with our Site. LiveCareer collects passive information for purposes such as improving a user's experience at the Site and the compilation of broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information for internal purposes and for disclosure to third parties such as advertisers and content partners. The types of passive information collected by this Site include, without limitation, your IP address, which type of browser you are using, how you came to our Site, where you go on our Site and how long you stay on any part of our Site. Passive information does not identify you to LiveCareer by name and LiveCareer does not link your IP address to your personally identifiable information. LiveCareer may use its own or third party cookies to collect this information and to enhance your experience on our Site. Cookies are an industry-standard and are small data files containing certain information written to your hard drive when you visit a website. You may opt to decline LiveCareer's or third party cookies, but this might impact the functionality of the Site and the quality of your experience with us. 

_Collection of Information from Children_ \--LiveCareer abides by federal law and the guidelines set up by the Federal Trade Commission regarding youth privacy. As such, LiveCareer will not knowingly collect any personal information from or allow the registration of young people under the age of 14. 

_Tell-A-Friend Program_ \--You can choose to let a friend, your parents, or your son/daughter know about LiveCareer through our Tell-A-Friend referral service. If you choose to use the Tell-A-Friend service, we will ask you for your friend/relative's name and e-mail address and LiveCareer will send your friend/relative an e-mail inviting him or her to visit LiveCareer to learn more about our services. You will also have the opportunity to send your career test results or your resume to your friend/relative to facilitate a discussion with them about your career and/or your resume. LiveCareer stores your friend's contact information for the sole purpose of sending the e-mail. 

2.        ** _USE OF INFORMATION_ **

The information which you supply to LiveCareer enables us to provide the assessment, salary data, resume tools and other tools which you select by matching the information you provide to our database of occupations, educational opportunities and other resources, including data provided by others who have visited our Site. Your information may be used in various ways, including: 

(i) For some tests/tools, the information you provide is aggregated with information from other Customers to create a comparative database that allows LiveCareer to produce results and reports for you. When your information or the information of other Customers is used in this way, it is aggregated and is not used or disclosed in a way that allows third parties (including other Customers) to identify any individual user. 

(ii) LiveCareer uses your information in order to customize our Site to your interests, enhance your overall experience on our Site and notify you of current and upcoming LiveCareer products and services. To save you time and effort, LiveCareer may pre-populate data fields within our Site or on third party affiliate offer forms with the information and materials, including resumes, you previously provided or submitted to the Site. In addition, LiveCareer tries to recognize you using various methods, including having you log in with your e-mail address and your password. Once LiveCareer recognizes you, pages, advertisements and other content is customized for you so that you can see what interests you the most. 

(iii) In addition, as described above, LiveCareer utilizes passive information to learn more about how you interact with our Site. This passive information may be combined with your other information for purposes such as testing and improving your experience on our Site and the compilation of broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information for internal purposes and for disclosure to third parties such as advertisers and content partners and others who may be interested in learning about the type of information LiveCareer collects. This aggregate passive information does not contain any personal information which can identify any individual user. 

_Contacting You by E-Mail_ \--LiveCareer may use your contact information periodically in order to send you e-mail regarding updates at the LiveCareer Site, such as new LiveCareer opportunities and additional listings which may be of interest to you. The frequency of these messages will vary depending upon your profile, including the types of career resources and other activities that you have indicated an interest in. In addition, we may send you free informational newsletters or notices relating to topics which may be of special interest to you, including career planning tools, financial aid, admissions tips, job opportunities and job advice. Finally, if you provide LiveCareer with permission at the time of registration, you may also receive commercial e-mails or communications from third parties. 

3.        **_SHARING OF INFORMATION_ **

LiveCareer will not knowingly sell, share, rent or otherwise transfer your information other than in accordance with the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy. 

Most importantly, LiveCareer wants you to know that **any information you provide outside of our registration process in connection with our products as well as information you provide while developing your resume, will not be shared with third parties, except as noted herein, unless you affirmatively direct LiveCareer to do so.**

With respect to information you provide during our registration process, LiveCareer gives you the option not to receive electronic communications from LiveCareer and third parties. If you do not opt-out, personal information about you (such as your contact information and other information collected during your visit to LiveCareer) may be shared with colleges, universities, potential employers, recruiters/headhunters, data aggregators, marketers (possibly in the form of list rental or license) and other organizations. 

These selected third parties may use your personal information to provide you with promotional materials about goods and services offered by them. Third parties to whom the personal identifying information is rented and/or licensed will be encouraged to target their offers carefully. When LiveCareer shares your personal information with a third party under any circumstance described in this Privacy Policy, your personal information will become permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of your personal information. Regardless of your decision regarding the sharing of your personal information, we may share broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information with our business partners. This aggregate information does not contain personal information which can identify any individual user. Of course, you may provide information in connection with specific offers. LiveCareer does not use such information, to the extent it is different from the information you provided during our registration process. Any information you provide in connection with a specific offer is shared only with the entity making the offer and only after you affirmatively indicate you want the information submitted to that third party. 

LiveCareer also provides you with a User job search email address (“User Email Address”) to receive job, product and service-related alerts. By using LiveCareer’s email services, you give LiveCareer the permission and power to choose which emails sent to your User Email Address should be filtered and which should be forwarded to your User Email Address. You give LiveCareer the permission to alter the content of 3rd party emails for any reason. You also give LiveCareer the permission to store copies of the filtered and forwarded email on its servers. LiveCareer does not receive or accept any authority over your usage of your User Email Address, and will not be held liable for anything related to your User Email Address. Please be advised that there is a risk involved whenever downloading email attachments to your computer and LiveCareer is not responsible for any damages caused by your decision to do so. 

_Third Party Service Providers_ \--From time to time, LiveCareer may decide that it is more efficient to use third parties to perform specific services, such as sending newsletters to LiveCareer's users or career management services or job search services. If we use a third party to provide specific services (such as sending newsletters to our users on our behalf), then information (such as contact information) may be shared with that party to the extent necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third party service providers are only allowed to use personally identifiable information for the purpose of providing the specific services requested by you or LiveCareer. The third party services covered by this paragraph do not include links to third party sites found on our Site, which are governed by a more specific provision (Links to Other Sites) below. 

We may allow third parties to use cookies or web beacons to collect information about you in connection with providing you information about products and services that might be of interest to you. These authorized third parties do not store or retain any personally identifiable information about you. Consumers who no longer wish to receive tailored advertisements from such third parties can click here. In addition, turning off your browser's cookies will prevent web beacons and cookies from being placed on your computer, however, you may also not be able to use all the interactive features of our site/emails if cookies are disabled. 

LiveCareer provides functionality on the Site that allows you to share information, for example, by creating an electronic profile, creating your own web page, posting certain information and materials such as your resume and distributing your resume, including via email. If you choose to make your profile, assessment results, reports or resume visible to others, including through blogs, forums, message boards, etc., LiveCareer strongly recommends you use caution and discretion. LIVECAREER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF ANY INFORMATION YOU CHOOSE TO DISCLOSE TO OTHERS THROUGH OUR SITE. 

_Disclosure to Law Enforcement and Similar Disclosures_ \--While LiveCareer strives to protect the personal information of our users, LiveCareer will release personal information (i) if required by law, in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary or appropriate; (ii) to protect the safety and security of LiveCareer including, without limitation, the safety and security of property that belongs to LiveCareer (iii) we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or violations of LiveCareer's Terms of Use. 

_Transfer of Ownership_ \-- In the event of a transfer of ownership of LiveCareer, such as an acquisition by or merger with another company, customer information will likely be included among the business assets transferred. LiveCareer will notify you, via email or prominent notice on the LiveCareer website, prior to any personal information being transferred in accordance with such transfer of ownership and becoming subject to a different privacy policy. 

4.        **_ Opt-Out_**

Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option to opt-out of any or all electronic communications from LiveCareer, our partners or third parties except that you may not opt out of receiving administrative emails from LiveCareer regarding the Site itself, or changes to our terms, conditions and policies because this information may be important to your use of the Site. Communications from third parties are not governed by the opt-out provisions of this Privacy Policy, but all such third parties are strongly encouraged to include opt-out procedures in their messages to you. 

If you opt-out of having your information shared with third parties who communicate with you electronically, LiveCareer will not share your information unless you specifically direct us to in response to a particular offer on our Site.
