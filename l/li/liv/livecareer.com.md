**COLLECTION OF INFORMATION**

Information is collected from our users at several different points during your visit to LiveCareer. 

_Registration_ \--A user must register in order to use this site. During registration, a user is required to provide certain categories of information, such as name, e-mail address, a password, whether they are a student, employed, or in another category, date of birth, gender, and country of citizenship. In addition, a user may choose to provide other categories of information, such as area of work or study. LiveCareer encourages its users to provide all of these fields of information so that users may maximize the effectiveness of our career tools and have the best possible experience with LiveCareer. 

_Optional Information_ \--At various other points during your visit to LiveCareer, you may be asked to provide information about yourself. For example, you may wish to sign up for information about online courses relevant to your career interests.  The use of other services which require the input of additional information is completely voluntary on your part, and you have the choice about whether to disclose the information necessary to use these features of our site. 

_Passive Collection of Information_ \--In addition to the information which you actively provide to LiveCareer by methods such as completing the registration form, LiveCareer collects information about how you interact with our site. LiveCareer collects passive information for purposes such as testing and improving a user's experience at the site and the compilation of broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information for internal purposes and for disclosure to third parties such as advertisers and content partners. The types of passive information collected by this site include, without limitation, your IP address, which type of browser you are using, where you go on our site, and how long you stay on any part of our site. Passive information does not identify you to LiveCareer by name, and LiveCareer does not link your IP address to your personally identifiable information. 

_Collection of Information from Children_ \--LiveCareer abides by federal law and the guidelines set up by the Federal Trade Commission regarding youth privacy. As such, LiveCareer will not knowingly collect any personal information from or allow the registration of young people under the age of 13. 

_Tell-A-Friend Programs_ \--You can choose to let a friend, your parents, or your son/daughter about LiveCareer through our Tell-A-Friend referral service. If you choose to use the Tell-A-Friend service, we will ask you for your friend/relative's name and e-mail address and LiveCareer will send your friend/relative an e-mail inviting him or her to visit LiveCareer to learn more about our services. You will also have the opportunity to send your career test results to your friend/relative to facilitate a discussion with them about your career.  LiveCareer stores your friend's contact information for the sole purpose of sending the e-mail. 

_1._ _        _**_USE OF INFORMATION_**

The information which you supply to LiveCareer enables us to provide the career assessment and planning tools which you select by matching your background to our database of occupations, educational opportunities, and other resources. In addition, LiveCareer uses your information in order to customize our site to your interests and enhance your overall experience at our site. LiveCareer tries to recognize you using various methods, including having you log in with your e-mail address and your password. Once LiveCareer recognizes you, pages, advertisements and other content is customized for you so that you can see what interests you the most. In addition, as described above, LiveCareer utilizes passive information to learn more about how you interact with our site. This passive information may be combined with your other information for purposes such as testing and improving your experience at our site and the compilation of broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information for internal purposes and for disclosure to third parties such as advertisers and content partners. This aggregate passive information does not contain any personal information which can identify any individual user. 

_Contacting You by E-Mail_ \--LiveCareer may use your contact information periodically in order to send you e-mail regarding updates at the LiveCareer site, such as new LiveCareer opportunities and additional listings which may be of interest to you. The frequency of these messages will vary depending upon your profile, including the types of career resources and other activities that you have indicated an interest in. In addition, we may send you free informational newsletters or notices relating to topics which may be of special interest to you, including career planning tools, financial aid, admissions tips, job opportunities and job advice. Finally, if you specifically provide LiveCareer with permission at the time of registration, you may also receive commercial e-mails. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option to opt-out of receiving newsletters and/or commercial e-mails whenever such messages are sent by LiveCareer, as described below. E-mail messages from third parties are not governed by the opt-out provisions of this Privacy Policy, but all such third parties are strongly encouraged to include opt-out procedures in their messages to you. 

_2._ _        _**_SHARING OF INFORMATION_**

LiveCareer will not knowingly sell, share, rent or otherwise transfer your information other than in accordance with the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy. 

During the registration process, and at certain points thereafter in connection with specific offers, LiveCareer asks you whether information about you may be sent to third parties who have products, services and opportunities which may be useful to you. LiveCareer understands how important your information is to you. Therefore, LiveCareer does not share any information that can be tied to you without your permission, and allows you the option to opt-out of having your information shared with third parties. If you do not exercise this opt-out option, personal information about you (such as your contact information and other information collected during your visit to LiveCareer) may be shared with colleges, universities, potential employers, recruiters/headhunters, data aggregators, marketers (possibly in the form of list rental or license), and other organizations. These selected third parties may use your personal information to provide you with promotional materials about goods and services offered by them.  Third parties to which the personal identifying information is rented and/or licensed will be encouraged to target their offers carefully.  When LiveCareer shares your personal information with a third party under any circumstance described in this Privacy Policy, your personal information will become permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of your personal information.  Regardless of your decision regarding the sharing of your personal information, we may share broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information with our business partners. This aggregate information does not contain any personal information which can identify any individual user. 

_Third Party Service Providers_ \--From time to time, LiveCareer may decide that it is more efficient to use third parties to perform specific services, such as sending newsletters to LiveCareer's users. If we use a third party to provide specific services (such as sending newsletters to our users on our behalf), then information (such as contact information) may be shared with that party to the extent necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third party service providers are only allowed to use personally identifiable information for the purpose of providing the specific services requested by LiveCareer. The third party services covered by this paragraph do not include links to third party sites found on our site, which are governed by a more specific provision _(Links to Other Sites)_ below. 

_Disclosure to Law Enforcement and Similar Disclosures_ \--While LiveCareer strives to protect the personal information of our users, LiveCareer will release personal information if required by law, in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary or appropriate and/or to protect the safety and security of LiveCareer including, without limitation, the safety and security of property that belongs to LiveCareer. 

_Transfer of Ownership_ \-- In the event of a transfer of ownership of LiveCareer, such as an acquisition by or merger with another company, customer information will likely be included among the business assets transferred.  LiveCareer will notify you, via email or prominent notice on the LiveCareer website, prior to any personal information being transferred in accordance with such transfer of ownership and becoming subject to a different privacy policy.

_3._ _        _**_SECURITY_**

LiveCareer has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse and/or unauthorized alteration of the information under our control. You are the only user authorized to update your profile, unless you provide your password information to another party. 

LiveCareer helps protect personally identifiable information by utilizing both online and offline security methods, including firewalls, passwords and restricted physical access to the places where your information is stored. Our staff is trained to comply with our security procedures, and our security procedures are regularly reviewed and revised, if necessary, by the Privacy Team at LiveCareer. 

If you have any questions about security issues at our site, please send an e-mail to [privacy@LiveCareer.com](mailto:privacy@livecareer.com), and we will try to answer your questions.
