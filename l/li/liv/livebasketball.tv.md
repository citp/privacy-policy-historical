**ANNEX TO PRIVACY NOTICE**

**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR EEA AND SWISS INDIVIDUALS**

In order to meet privacy regulations in the EEA, Switzerland and the UK, Perform provides additional information to its EEA based individuals.

**What is personal data?**

“ **Personal data** ” is information about you (a “ **data subject** ”) the use of which is governed by applicable data protection laws. It will include any information from which you can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as your name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or other information about your identity. Most User Information will constitute personal data. 

**Who is responsible for your data?**

If you use our Service, the Data Controller is:

Perform Media Services Ltd

Sussex House

Plane Tree Crescent

Feltham

TW13 7HE 

United Kingdom

Perform Media Services Ltd is registered as a data controller with the Information Commissioner’s Office (registration number ZA188575).

**What is the legal basis on which Perform relies to process your data?** ****

On some occasions, we process your data with your consent (for example, when you agree to participate in our surveys and other activities or when you give us consent to send you marketing communications or to deal with your enquiries).

On other occasions, we process your data when we need to do this in order to fulfil a contract with you (for example, to make available to you the requested content or for billing purposes) or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract (for example, verifying your information). 

We also process your data when it is in our legitimate interests to do this and when these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights.  For example, we may process your personal data in our legitimate interests to ensure that our Service is provided efficiently and in a user-friendly and personalised manner taking into account user feedback, data and profiles, unless consent is required for any such processing under applicable law. We will process personal data to ensure the security of our business and the information of our users, and to ensure the proper and efficient administration of our business.

Finally, we will process your personal data where we are required to do this by law (for example, where we have to fulfil anti-money laundering requirements or disclose information under a court order). 

**How long does Perform keep data?**

Perform keeps your data for only as long as required to provide you with the necessary Service and to carry out the processing set out in this notice, and in line with its obligation under applicable law.  This means that we will generally not keep your User Information for longer than six years following your last interaction with us.

**Your rights**

You may ask us for a copy of your information, to correct it, erase it or to transfer it to other organisations at your request. You also have rights to object to some processing including profiling and, where we have asked for your consent to process your data, to withdraw this consent. In particular, you have rights to object to direct marketing at any time. Where you withdraw your consent, this will not affect the legitimacy of the processing conducted prior to your request.

Where we process your data because we have a legitimate interest in doing so (as explained above), you have a right to object to this. Where we make a decision based solely on automated processing which significantly affects you, you may have the right to contest the decision, express your point of view and obtain human intervention. 

These rights may be limited in some situations – for example, where we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your data. 

Please use the contact information set out in our Contact section above. We will aim to acknowledge your enquiries within 72 hours and respond within one month, unless otherwise required by law. 

We hope that we can satisfy queries you may have about the way we process your data. However, if you have unresolved concerns you also have the right to complain to the relevant data protection authorities (in the case of the UK, the Information Commissioner).
