**2\. Information Collection and Use**

LiveDeal collects personal information from our users at several different points on our web site. This includes when you register with LiveDeal and when you conduct certain activities on the web site. 

When you register, we ask for information such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, city, state and zip code. We may also ask you for credit card information to enable us to bill you fees for our services. Once you register with LiveDeal and login to our services, you are not anonymous to us. However, you can browse our web site without telling us who you are or revealing personal information about yourself. 

When you wish to contact a seller regarding an item listed on our web site, we ask you for your email address and you may also volunteer to provide your telephone number. In addition, each member may provide information about the buyers with whom they deal (including the email address, and feedback regarding the other member's performance during the transaction). Finally, we may also collect the Internet Protocol (IP) address and other information regarding transactions in which you participate (either as a buyer or seller) through our web site. 

If you elect to use our referral service to inform a friend about our web site, we ask you for the friend's name and email address. We will automatically send the friend an email inviting him or her to visit our web site. The referral message will be sent to you friend’s email address one time, and will not be stored or used for any other purpose. 

We use the information that we collect to improve product offerings, fulfill your requests, bill you for services, customize the web site's content and layout, develop feedback ratings, contact you, and for marketing activities and statistical analysis. 

LiveDeal automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, LiveDeal cookies information, and the page you request. Our collection and use of such information is further described below. 

**3\. Information Sharing and Disclosure**

LiveDeal is the sole owner of the information collected on [ www.livedeal.com](http://www.livedeal.com/index.jsp). We will not rent, sell or share your personal information with anyone except under the following circumstances: 

  * Other visitors to our web site may view your member ID, feedback rating, city, region and items or messages that you have posted on our web site. 
  * In order to complete a transaction, the buyer and seller will communicate directly. To enable such communications, we will disclose a buyer's email address and (where the buyer has chosen to provide such information) telephone number to the seller. 
  * We provide information about our users to trusted partners **(such as credit card processor)** who work on our behalf pursuant to confidentiality agreements.  Pursuant to the terms of their agreements, these companies do not have any independent right to share or use such information. 
  * We may disclose user information in response to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. 
  * We may disclose user information when we believe such disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our User Agreement, or as otherwise required by law. 
  * We may transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, we will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 



Of course, once you provide personal information to a buyer or seller on our web site, LiveDeal has no control over how your information is used or shared by that individual. You should discuss any privacy concerns you may have with any individual you meet through our web site, as the only protection you will have is whatever terms you agree to directly with this individual. 

On account of the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. 

**4\. Cookies**

Some of our business partners (e.g., tracking utility agents, advertisers) use cookies on our site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies. 

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by LiveDeal, Inc. www.livedeal.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

**5\. Log Files**

However, we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the LiveDeal web site, such as service announcements and administrative messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them. [This sentence is confusing. Are users still going to receive emails about new services and promotions after they have opted-out of marketing and promotional email? Emails about new services and promotions are considered commercial email and the user needs to be presented the opportunity to opt-out. State how users can opt-out of these communications.] 

Upon your request, we will deactivate your account, contact information, billing information and any financial information from our active databases. To make this request, email . Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible based on your account activity and in accordance with our User Agreement and applicable law. 

We will retain in our files some personal information you have requested to edit or remove to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our User Agreement and comply with legal requirements as is permitted by law. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personal information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests. However, such personal information will be deactivated from public and user viewing and will only be available to select LiveDeal personnel for the limited purposes described above. 

**7\. Confidentiality and Security**

Your personal information is stored on LiveDeal's servers located in the United States .
