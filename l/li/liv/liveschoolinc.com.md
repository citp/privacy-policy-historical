LiveSchool Privacy Policy

Last Updated: May 5th, 2014

We recognize that your privacy is important and take it seriously. This Privacy Policy describes LiveSchool’s policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you access the LiveSchool website and blog (“Website”).   By accessing the Website, you consent to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. LiveSchool reserves the right to amend this Privacy Policy, and if we do, any such changes will be included on this page so current privacy information will always be available to you. The Privacy Policy will also note the date on which it was last changed.

Personal Information

The only personal information collected by LiveSchool is personal information that is voluntarily provided by users. We don't collect personal information without your knowledge. We don’t sell your personal information to third parties. We will use your personal information to fulfill requests made by you and for other business purposes of LiveSchool and any of its successors. We may also use your personal information to send you marketing materials or other information about LiveSchool and its products and services, or LiveSchool’s partners, advertisers, and other parties, goods, or services that may be of interest to you.

An example of how we may collect personal information is in connection with signing up for an account. The information you provide in registering for an account will be used by us to give you the information or service you are requesting. We may also use your name, phone number, email address, or home address to send you marketing materials and other information about LiveSchool and its products and services, or LiveSchool’s partners, advertisers, and other parties, goods or services that may be of interest to you. You may opt-out of receiving any additional information by following the clear instructions at the bottom of each email to opt out of future emails.

Transactional emails for the purposes of maintaining your account are not communication of which you can opt out. If you would like to delete your account and stop receiving emails pertaining to your LiveSchool account, email support@liveschoolinc.com with the subject line “Cancel Account.”

Children’s Privacy

Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. Our website is not intended for children under 13 years of age. LiveSchool does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register to use our Services. If you learn that our Services are being used by a child under the age of 13, please contact us at support@LiveSchool.com. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information.

Your California Privacy Rights

California law permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personally identifiable information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the types of personally identifiable information disclosed to those parties. If you are a California resident and would like to request this information, please submit your request in an email to support@LiveSchool.com.

Traffic Data and Other Non-Personal Information

We automatically collect and store certain non-personal information concerning the traffic to our website and web applications, including, for example: the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our sites; and the internet address of the site from which you linked to our website or web application. We use this information as anonymous aggregate data for business purposes such as to determine the number of visitors to different sections of a website, to ensure the site is working properly, and to help us make the website more useful. We also use this information to see where leads are generated from in an attempt to better optimize our ongoing internet marketing efforts.

At this time, our website does not use persistent “cookies” or other tracking mechanisms that collect personally identifying information. We use session cookies to anonymously collect the date and time of the visit. Accepting session cookies on our site is voluntary; you may still use the site if you decline cookies.

You may also provide us with other non-personal information. For example, you may provide us with information regarding how you learned about us, or you may provide us with information regarding why you are interested in our products or services. This information may be used by our marketing and product personnel to better optimize our ongoing marketing and product development efforts.

Contests, Sweepstakes or Special Offers

We may offer promotions, contests, or sweepstakes that may require that you enter contact information to qualify for entry. Collected data from promotions, contests, or sweepstakes may be used to process entries, send promotional materials, notify entrants, and may be shared with other companies in connection with these activities.

Links to Other Websites

Our website and web applications may contain links to other websites and may provide opportunities to publish certain information to third party websites or social media platforms. LiveSchool is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of that website, platform, or any other linked services. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our website and web applications, and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects or publishes personal information. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies.

Third Party Service Providers

LiveSchool works with certain third parties to provide our Services. These third parties may collect personal and non-personal information from users of our Services. For example, monetary transactions may be facilitated by a third party payment processor, in which case you and/or LiveSchool would share your information, including information about your financial accounts, with the processor, for this purpose. We encourage our users to read the privacy policies of any third parties. LiveSchool is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any third parties. If you have questions about what third parties are involved with our Services, please contact us at support@LiveSchool.com.

Security

When you submit information via our Services we take efforts to protect your information both online and offline. Please keep in mind, however, that whenever you give out personal information online, such information is not always secure in transit. While we strive to protect your privacy and secure your information, we cannot guarantee the security of information sent over the internet, and you disclose such information at your own risk.
