is not directed at children under 13 years of age but, we recognize that
with proper adult supervision some parents might permit their children to

verify that the child's parent or guardian knows about and authorizes our
information practices related to children protected by COPPA; and</li>

authorization that the parent or guardian consents to the Terms of Service
and this privacy policy.</li>

collect will be treated the same as information collected from any other
user of LiveJournal.com.  Without verified parental notice and consent,
we will not knowingly collect personal information of children under 13
years of age, and if we learn that we have inadvertently collected such
information, we will promptly delete it.</li>
