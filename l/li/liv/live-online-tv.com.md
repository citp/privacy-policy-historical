A web beacon (also called a clear gif or pixel tag) is a 1x1 pixel .gif image that advertisers place on their webpages. When you visit these pages, the web beacons can send your browser type, IP address, and other basic information to a server so advertisers can analyze the effectiveness of their ad campaigns.
