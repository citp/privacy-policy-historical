        How LiveJasmin Protects Your Privacy: <br>
        </strong></font> </div>
      <font size="+2"><strong>Summary: </strong></font> 
      <ul>
        <li>We <b>NEVER</b> sell, rent or share your personal information or email 
          address with any other party. 
        </li><li>We may send you occasional promotional emails, and every email will 
          contain an unsubscribe option. 
        </li><li>Your personal information is <b>never</b> stored on LiveJasmin.com's 
          server, so it cannot be stolen by hackers. </li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left">Below are the complete details of our privacy policy:<br>
        <br>
        <strong><font size="+2"> Not only do we respect your privacy, we protect 
        your privacy.</font></strong> 
      </p><p>LiveJasmin is occasionally contacted by third parties who, for marketing 
        purposes, want to purchase our mailing list and other sensitive customer 
        information derived from our database. Although there is no law forbidding 
        LiveJasmin from selling such information, the trading of which is an extremely 
        lucrative business , LiveJasmin is serious in its commitment to protecting 
        your personal privacy. We have never sold such personal information about 
        our customers to outside parties -- not even once -- and we don't intend 
        to.</p>
      <p>As a general rule, LiveJasmin collects only three kinds of information 
        about you: (1) Information that you voluntarily provide to us or authorize, 
        such as your name, address, credit-card and other account information 
        as submitted on the LiveJasmin Membership Submission Form, (2) "Log 
        information" about the areas of LiveJasmin that you visit, that are 
        accessible from the general internet environment, and (3) private correspondence, 
        such as the contents of e-mail messages you exchange with LiveJasmin.</p>
      <p>Log information bears greater explanation: Log information typically 
        consists of such things as your browser type (i.e., Netscape or MSIE), 
        your IP address (i.e., 102.316.52.11), the domain name from which you 
        are visiting LiveJasmin (i.e., "aol.com"), and which pages of 
        LiveJasmin that you visit. Like all internet services, we analyze our 
        log files to better understand which areas of LiveJasmin are more popular 
        than others. And like most other large-scale internet properties, we also 
        use this information to "customize" the LiveJasmin experience 
        to match your tastes. For example, if you first visit LiveJasmin by searching 
        an internet portal for a search term such as "voyeur" and clicking 
        upon an LiveJasmin banner or link, LiveJasmin may set a "cookie" 
        on your computer which records the term as a "search preference" 
        (Note: Everyday log-analysis programs such as WebTrends include such tracking 
        of keyword-specific traffic as a regular feature - indeed, using such 
        tools, the administrators of most websites on earth track traffic originating 
        from search engines by searched keyword). Later, as you navigate through 
        LiveJasmin, you will likely observe that the content you see on LiveJasmin 
        tends to be tailored to match your recorded search preference. Note: such 
        cookies are "secure" in that they cannot be read by other internet 
        companies, but can only be read by the web site which placed the cookie.</p>
      <p>LiveJasmin also uses your recorded "search preference" information 
        to better target and allocate marketing expenditures. For example, if 
        LiveJasmin learns that, in aggregate, individuals who search portals for 
        terms such as "voyeur" are more likely to purchase goods and 
        services from LiveJasmin than individuals who search for terms such as 
        "livecams", LiveJasmin may allocate greater portions of its 
        marketing budget to targeting the former group, and a smaller portion 
        of its budget to target the latter group. By optimizing marketing strategies 
        in this manner, LiveJasmin has more disposable capital that can be deployed 
        toward development efforts which improve the LiveJasmin platform and provide 
        a richer customer experience for all.</p>
      <p>Speaking of cookies, another kind of cookie that LiveJasmin sets is an 
        "identification cookie". This cookie is written whenever you 
        successfully use your login and password to access a restricted area of 
        LiveJasmin; the identification cookie is available only to individuals 
        who have already been verified as adults, via LiveJasmin' verification 
        procedures. When LiveJasmin' servers observe this identification cookie 
        on your computer, they recognize you and therefore might deliver unmodified 
        content as opposed to modified content - in effect, another form of customized 
        content tailored to suit your indicated preferences.</p>
      <p>Another question that should concern you: "Does LiveJasmin outsource 
        to other companies any privacy-sensitive functions such as management 
        of its email newsletter system, web hosting, or its e-commerce platform?" 
        Because LiveJasmin is committed to safeguarding the integrity of your 
        personal information, we have elected to not use such services, despite 
        the fact that they are reasonably-priced and simplify the management task 
        of running a large and complex website operation.</p>
