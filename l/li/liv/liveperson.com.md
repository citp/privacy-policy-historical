Does LivePerson use cookies?

We may use cookies and other identification technologies for record keeping purposes and to enhance your experience, if you choose to visit our websites 

**Cookies:**

Cookies are small text files stored on a visitor’s web browser and applications. Cookies are often used to make web-browsing easier by performing functions such as saving passwords and maintaining lists of personal preferences regarding the use of the website.

Our websites, apps and Services may use the following types of cookies:

  * Strictly Necessary Cookies – these cookies are essential to enable you to browse our websites, apps and Services and use the available features.
  * Performance Cookies – these cookies collect information about how you use our websites, apps and Services. For instance, these cookies track which pages you visit most. This data may be used to help optimize our websites, apps and Services and make it easier for you to navigate within them. These cookies do not collect information that identifies you; all information is aggregated and anonymous.
  * Functionality Cookies – these cookies allow our websites, apps and Services to remember choices you make while browsing, such as geographic location and preferences such as text size and fonts. The information collected by these cookies will not personally identify you.



**Other identification technologies that may be used by LivePerson websites, apps and Services:**

  * Pixel tags (also called beacons or pixels) – these are small blocks of code installed on (or called by) a webpage or application, which can retrieve certain information about your device and browser, including device type, operating system, browser type and version, website visited, time of visit, referring website, IP address and other similar information.
  * Software Development Kits (also called SDKs) - function like pixels and cookies, but operate in the mobile application context where pixels and cookies cannot always function. The application developer can install pieces of code (the SDK) into the application to collect certain information about user interaction with the application and information about the user device and network information.



**Third-party technologies:**

LivePerson may use third-party service providers who are authorized to place cookies, pixel tags or similar technologies on our websites, apps and Services with our permission.  These technologies help us compile metrics and analytics (without collecting personally identifiable information) to help improve our websites, apps and Services.  Third-party cookies and technologies are covered by the third party’s privacy policy. 

**Your choice:**

Web browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you prefer not to receive cookies, you typically have the option of setting your browser to refuse cookies. If your browser is set to refuse cookies, it is likely that some of the functionality offered by LivePerson will not be available or will not work as effectively for you. 

For further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, you can visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) and [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).

**Do Not Track**

Various browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari, currently offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology that sends a signal to websites a user visits about that user’s browser DNT preferences. While LivePerson attempts to honor the DNT instructions received from a user’s browser, LivePerson cannot guarantee that it will always respond to such signals because a common industry standard for DNT has not been adopted. LivePerson will continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology.

Reasons we share personal data

We may share your information if we reasonably believe that it:  (i) is necessary to comply with a legal process (such as a court order, subpoena, or search warrant) or other legal requirement of any governmental authority; (ii) would potentially mitigate our liability in an actual or potential lawsuit; (iii) is necessary to enforce this privacy policy or our Terms of Use at [www.liveperson.com/policies/terms-of-use](http://www.liveperson.com/policies/terms-of-use) or any other agreement in place between you and LivePerson; (iv) is necessary to investigate and prevent unauthorized transactions or other illegal activities; and/or (v) is otherwise necessary or appropriate to protect our rights or property or the rights or property of any person or entity.

We may aggregate information so that it is not personally identifiable and use and share such aggregated information for training and quality assurance purposes and to deliver and improve our Services.

We use a limited number of third-party service providers to assist us in making our websites and Services available to visitors and users. For example, we may share data with third parties who provide services to us, such as credit card processing services, analytics and data storage services. These third parties may access, process or store personal data in the course of providing their services.

LivePerson does not sell, trade or rent personal information provided by you in any transcript, survey or recording for direct marketing or any other purpose, except as provided in this privacy policy or with your permission.  LivePerson does not disclose the contents of transcripts, surveys or recordings other than to service providers performing services on behalf of LivePerson, other than as provided in this privacy policy or with your permission.  If you engage with a brand that uses our Services, we may also share your information with the brand and our third party service providers.

Access and changes to personal data

If you elect to engage in any communication or engagement session with LivePerson or a customer that uses our Services, it is up to you to decide what, if any, information to provide during such session.  Depending on your request, it may not be possible for us or our customer to address all of your questions without further information from you.  Nevertheless, if you do not wish to provide certain information, then you should not do so. 

Third-party integrations

From time to time, we may partner with other companies to allow LivePerson and its customers to offer integrations with our Services.  If you engage with a brand that uses one of these integrations, LivePerson may share your data with the third-party partner, receive data about you from the third-party partner, and/or combine third-party partner data about you with information about you that we collect.  We do not control how a third-party partner may use your data.   Use of your information by the third-party partner there is governed by its privacy policies.  If you do not wish for your information to be shared in this way, you may opt not to use such integrations.

How can I access or update my information with LivePerson?

If you have signed up to receive LivePerson’s marketing or advertising communications, you may, at any time, opt out of receiving further communications by clicking on the opt-out link at the bottom of a marketing or advertising email you receive.  You may also contact us at [privacy@liveperson.com](mailto:privacy@liveperson.com) to opt out or to request changes to your personal information.

I f you would like to correct or delete the personal data you provided to a brand with whom you engaged through the Services, you may either contact the brand directly, or contact us at [privacy@liveperson.com](mailto:privacy@liveperson.com), and we can help put you in touch with the brand.

How does LivePerson keep my information secure?

We use security measures designed to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.  For certain LivePerson Services, chat/messaging transcripts are encrypted during transmission.  In addition, transcripts that we store are maintained and archived on secure, hardened servers that are hosted on highly secure data centers.  Access to this data is protected by multiple layers of controls, including firewalls, role-based access controls, authentication mechanisms and monitoring.  Data is backed up, and archives are stored off-site in a secure location. We also offer additional encryption functionality and data masking to our customers. 

If you are communicating with a brand that uses our Services, you should review the privacy practices of that brand to understand which security measures they use. 

Additional mobile considerations

In addition to the other terms in this policy, if you use our mobile applications, access our mobile-optimized websites or have a conversation with a LivePerson customer that uses our Services in its mobile application, we may receive information about your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. 

If you receive SMS messages from LivePerson, you may opt out by following the opt-out instructions that we provide or by contacting us at [privacy@liveperson.com](mailto:privacy@liveperson.com). 

If you receive SMS messages from one of our customers, you may opt out by following the opt-out instructions provided by the brand you are communicating with or by contacting the brand.  You may also contact us at [privacy@liveperson.com](mailto:privacy@liveperson.com), and we can help put you in touch with the brand regarding your request.

LivePerson communities, message boards and blogs

Information that you share on LivePerson communities, message boards or blogs becomes publicly available and therefore may be read, collected, copied and used by other users for any purposes at their discretion.  Because this information is publicly available, LivePerson’s privacy obligations outlined in this privacy policy do not apply to your use of any such communities, message boards or blogs.

International data transfers

If you are located outside of the United States, please note that we may transfer your personal data outside your country of origin.  By providing or making available your personal data, you consent to that transfer.

We adhere to the principles of the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States and have certified our compliance with the U.S. Department of Commerce.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework and to view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website at www.privacyshield.gov.

As mentioned above, we use a limited number of third-party service providers to make our websites and Services available that may access, process, or store personal data in the course of providing services. We currently maintain contracts with these third parties restricting their access, use and disclosure of personal data, and are in the process of updating these contracts in compliance with our Privacy Shield obligations. LivePerson is responsible if these third parties process personal data in violation of the Privacy Shield principles (unless LivePerson can prove that it’s not responsible for the third party’s action that violated the Privacy Shield principles).

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, We are subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

EU individuals have the right to access personal data about them, and to limit use and disclosure of their personal data.  With our Privacy Shield certification, LivePerson has committed to respect those rights.  Because our personnel has limited ability to access personal data our customers submit through our Services, if you wish to request access to or to limit use and/or disclosure of your personal data, please contact us with the name of the LivePerson customer through which you used our Services.  We will refer your request to that customer, and will support them as needed in responding to your request.

Any inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield compliance may be directed to [privacy@liveperson.com](mailto:privacy@liveperson.com).  We will respond within 45 days and provide appropriate recourse at no cost to you.  If we fail to respond within that time, or if our response does not address your concern, you may contact JAMS at [www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/), an independent third-party dispute resolution mechanism based in the United States.  If neither LivePerson nor JAMS resolves your complaint, the Privacy Shield Panel, a binding arbitration mechanism provided under the Privacy Shield program, may be available to you.

LivePerson complies with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from Switzerland. LivePerson has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view LivePerson's certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

We are not responsible for and do not control the privacy practices of any of our customers or any other third party.  We encourage you to review the privacy practices of each third party.
