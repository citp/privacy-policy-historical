        <ul>
          <li>We <b>NEVER</b> sell, rent or share your personal information or email 
            address with any other party. 
          </li><li>We may send you occasional promotional emails, and every email will 
            contain an unsubscribe option. 
          </li><li>Your personal information is <b>never</b> stored on LivePrivates.com's 
            server, so it cannot be stolen by hackers. </li>
        </ul>
        <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong><br>
              <font color="#cccc00">Below are the complete details of our privacy policy:</font></strong></font>
          
          <strong><font size="+2"> </font></strong>
        </p><p align="justify">LivePrivates is occasionally contacted by third parties 
          who, for marketing purposes, want to purchase our mailing list and other 
          sensitive customer information derived from our database. Although there 
          is no law forbidding LivePrivates from selling such information, the trading 
          of which is an extremely lucrative business , LivePrivates is serious in 
          its commitment to protecting your personal privacy. We have never sold 
          such personal information about our customers to outside parties -- not 
          even once -- and we don't intend to.</p>
        <p align="justify">As a general rule, LivePrivates collects only three kinds 
          of information about you: (1) Information that you voluntarily provide 
          to us or authorize, such as your name, address, credit-card and other 
          account information as submitted on the LivePrivates Membership Submission 
          Form, (2) "Log information" about the areas of LivePrivates that 
          you visit, that are accessible from the general internet environment, 
          and (3) private correspondence, such as the contents of e-mail messages 
          you exchange with LivePrivates.</p>
        <p align="justify">Log information bears greater explanation: Log information 
          typically consists of such things as your browser type (i.e., Netscape 
          or MSIE), your IP address (i.e., 102.316.52.11), the domain name from 
          which you are visiting LivePrivates (i.e., "aol.com"), and which 
          pages of LivePrivates that you visit. Like all internet services, we analyze 
          our log files to better understand which areas of LivePrivates are more 
          popular than others. And like most other large-scale internet properties, 
          we also use this information to "customize" the LivePrivates experience 
          to match your tastes. For example, if you first visit LivePrivates by searching 
          an internet portal for a search term such as "voyeur" and clicking 
          upon an LivePrivates banner or link, LivePrivates may set a "cookie" 
          on your computer which records the term as a "search preference" 
          (Note: Everyday log-analysis programs such as WebTrends include such tracking 
          of keyword-specific traffic as a regular feature - indeed, using such 
          tools, the administrators of most websites on earth track traffic originating 
          from search engines by searched keyword). Later, as you navigate through 
          LivePrivates, you will likely observe that the content you see on LivePrivates 
          tends to be tailored to match your recorded search preference. Note: such 
          cookies are "secure" in that they cannot be read by other internet 
          companies, but can only be read by the web site which placed the cookie.</p>
        <p align="justify">LivePrivates also uses your recorded "search preference" 
          information to better target and allocate marketing expenditures. For 
          example, if LivePrivates learns that, in aggregate, individuals who search 
          portals for terms such as "voyeur" are more likely to purchase 
          goods and services from LivePrivates than individuals who search for terms 
          such as "livecams", LivePrivates may allocate greater portions 
          of its marketing budget to targeting the former group, and a smaller portion 
          of its budget to target the latter group. By optimizing marketing strategies 
          in this manner, LivePrivates has more disposable capital that can be deployed 
          toward development efforts which improve the LivePrivates platform and provide 
          a richer customer experience for all.</p>
        <p align="justify">Speaking of cookies, another kind of cookie that LivePrivates 
          sets is an "identification cookie". This cookie is written whenever 
          you successfully use your login and password to access a restricted area 
          of LivePrivates; the identification cookie is available only to individuals 
          who have already been verified as adults, via LivePrivates' verification 
          procedures. When LivePrivates' servers observe this identification cookie 
          on your computer, they recognize you and therefore might deliver unmodified 
          content as opposed to modified content - in effect, another form of customized 
          content tailored to suit your indicated preferences.</p>
        <p align="justify">Another question that should concern you: "Does 
          LivePrivates outsource to other companies any privacy-sensitive functions 
          such as management of its email newsletter system, web hosting, or its 
          e-commerce platform?" Because LivePrivates is committed to safeguarding 
          the integrity of your personal information, we have elected to not use 
          such services, despite the fact that they are reasonably-priced and simplify 
          the management task of running a large and complex website operation.</p>
