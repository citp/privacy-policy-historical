# Terms of Use and Policies

Updated July 13, 2017 

At LiveAbout, we take online privacy seriously and we respect the concerns of our community of users. In this policy, we describe our privacy practices with regard to information we collect through LiveAbout.com and affiliated sites and email properties (collectively, the “Site“) to help you make informed decisions about how you share information when you visit or use the Site. 

### Understanding How Information Is Collected on LiveAbout:

#### Information You May Choose to Provide to Us

We may collect information, including personally identifiable information, directly from you if you choose to provide that information. For example, you may provide us with your name and contact information (such as an email address), date of birth, or other details of that nature, when you sign up for our newsletters or participate in promotions or surveys on the Site. 

You also may choose to provide personally identifiable information about yourself when you participate in forums or discussions or other Interactive Services on the Site. Please be aware that information you post may be viewed or captured by anyone who visits the Site, therefore you should avoid posting sensitive or personal information that you would not want to be available to the public. 

#### Information That Is Automatically Collected When You Visit LiveAbout

When you access the Site, we and our third-party partners and vendors may automatically collect certain information about your visit using tools such as cookies, web beacons, and other data collecting and tracking technologies. The information collected automatically when you visit the Site may include your IP address, characteristics of your operating system, information about your browser and system settings, data about the computer or mobile device you use to access the Site, unique device identifiers, clickstream data (which shows the page-by-page path you take as you browse the Site), and other details that generally are not considered personally identifiable. 

**Cookies** are small files that websites and other online services use to store information about users on the users' own computers. This Site may use cookies (such as HTTP and HTML5 cookies and Flash cookies), as well as other types of local storage. For more information about cookies, you may visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). See the section below regarding Your choices to learn more about how you may limit or disable cookies on your computer. If you choose to disable cookies, that could affect certain features of the Site that use cookies to enhance their functionality. 

To manage our automatic data collection, we may place tags (often referred to as “web beacons“) and other tracking mechanisms on pages on the Site, in videos, or in emails we send to you. **Web beacons** are small files that link web pages to particular web servers and their cookies, and they may be used for a variety of purposes, such as counting the number of visitors to the Site, analyzing how users navigate around the Site, assessing how many emails that we send are actually opened and which articles or links are viewed by visitors. 

We also use third-party web analytics services, such as Google Analytics, on the Site, to provide us with statistics and other information about visitors to the Site. [Click here to learn more about Google Analytics and how you may opt out.](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html)

**“Do Not Track“ Signals.** Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “do not track“ signal to websites and online services you visit. At this time there is no consensus among industry participants as to the meaning of “do not track“ in this context. Like many other websites, LiveAbout.com is not configured to respond to “do not track“ signals from browsers. [Click here to learn more about "do not track" signals.](https://allaboutdnt.com/)

Finally, companies that provide certain third-party apps, tools, widgets, and plug-ins that may appear on the Site (for example, Facebook “Like“ buttons) also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features. This information collection is subject to the privacy policies or notices of those providers. 

#### Information We Receive From Other Sources

We may supplement the information we collect with information from outside sources in order to learn more about our users, to better tailor the content and offers we make available to you, and for other lawful business purposes. We may receive this information about you from third parties, including without limitation data resellers and advertisers. We may combine the information we receive from those other (online and offline) sources with information we collect through the Site. 

#### How We May Use Information We Collect

We (and our partners) may use the information gathered on LiveAbout for various purposes, including the purposes listed below. For example, if you were to contact us with a question and provide your email address, we would use the email address you provided to respond to your inquiry. In addition, we use information we collect from you and through the Site to: 

  * Provide products and services you request (such as when you sign up to receive our email newsletters) or that we otherwise believe would interest you, including promotional offers from us and our third-party partners; 
  * Respond to requests, questions, and comments, and provide other types of user support and customer care; 
  * Offer you products and services, or direct you to portions of this Site or other websites, that we believe may interest you;

  * Communicate about, and administer your participation in, events, programs, contests, sweepstakes, and other offers or promotions; 
  * Carry out, evaluate, and improve our business (which may include without limitation developing new features for the Site; analyzing and enhancing the user experience on the Site; assessing the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising; and managing our communications); 
  * Perform data analytics regarding usage of the Site (including market and customer research, trend analysis, financial analysis, and anonymization of personal information); 
  * Guard against identity theft, and prevent fraud and other criminal activity, claims, and other liabilities; 
  * Comply with applicable legal requirements, law enforcement requests, and our company policies; and 
  * For other purposes that are disclosed at the time you provide your information, with your consent. 



#### How We May Share Information

Our agents, vendors, consultants, and other service providers may have access to information we collect through the Site to carry out work on our behalf. In addition, certain service providers may collect or access information through the Site to enable or provide services, tools, or other features available on the Site. We also may share information: 

  * With our affiliates for internal business purposes; 
  * With third parties for marketing purposes, including social media platforms; we may also match your email address with third parties with whom you have also consented to share your email address and use such match to deliver custom offers or emails to you on the Site and elsewhere online; 
  * If we are required to do so by law, regulation, or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena); 
  * In response to requests from government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities; 
  * If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; 
  * With respect to analytics and statistical information, to inform advertisers about the nature of our user base; 
  * In the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including a reorganization, dissolution, or liquidation); and 
  * With your consent or at your discretion.
