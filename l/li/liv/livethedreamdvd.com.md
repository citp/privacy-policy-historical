  2. automatically as you navigate over time and across our Content or other online services; and
  3. from third parties, for example, our business partners.

We may disclose Personal Data to the following types of third parties:

_Referrals_  
We share your name, address, telephone number, and other contact details with the member, if any, who referred you to our website. You have the ability to control referral sharing in your account privacy settings. For EU persons, referral sharing is turned off by default. 

_Service Providers_  
We may share Personal Data with our contracted service providers, such as billing or payment processors, so that these service providers can provide services on our behalf; traffic tracking and targeted advertising services, which may enable us to show you ads after you leave our site; and technical providers who help us diagnose technical problems and administer our site so that we can constantly improve our services. Unless described in this Privacy Policy, we do not share, sell, rent, or trade any information with third parties for their promotional purposes.

_Successors and Affiliates_  
We may share Personal Data with our members of our corporate group and affiliates in order to work with them. For example, we may need to share Customer Information for customer relationship management purposes. We may also transfer Personal Data in the event of an audit or if we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a merger, acquisition, joint venture, reorganization, dissolution, or liquidation).

_Partners and Affiliated Businesses Not Controlled by Us_  
We may partner with other companies to jointly offer products or services. If you purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly offered product or service from us, we may share Personal Data collected in connection with your purchase or expression of interest with our partners.

If you do not wish for your information to be shared in this manner, you may choose not to purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly offered product or service.

_Compelled Disclosure_  
It may be necessary for us to disclose your Personal Data, either by law, legal process, litigation, or requests from public and governmental authorities. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose Personal Data if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. Other than as described above, we do not permit third parties to collect personally identifiable information about your online activities when you use our website and related services. We may disclose aggregated information about our users without restriction. Such information does not identify an individual person.

_Targeted Advertising._  
We partner with third party services and advertising networks to manage our advertising on other sites.

We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy; third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.

#### 3.2. EU Persons

Persons located in the EU have specific rights granted to them under the General Data Protection Regulation and national implementing laws, regulations, and secondary legislation.

_Limited Processing_  
We limit the processing of Personal Data of persons in the EU (“EU Personal Data”) to that which is relevant for the purposes of the particular processing. We do not process EU Personal Data in ways that are inconsistent with the purposes for which the information was collected or subsequently authorized by you. 

In addition, to the extent necessary for these purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that the EU Personal Data we process is reliable for its intended use, and accurate, complete and current. In this regard, we rely on you to update and correct EU Personal Data to the extent necessary for the purposes for which the information was collected or subsequently authorized. You may contact us at [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f282809b8493918bb29f8b9e979396818b8186979f82809ddc919d9f) to request that we update or correct relevant EU Personal Data.

Subject to applicable law, we retain EU Personal Data in a form that identifies or renders you identifiable only for as long as it serves a purpose that is compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by you.

_Notice and Consent_  
If we decide to process EU Personal Data for purposes other than what is necessary to provide services to you or where we believe that your interests may override ours, persons in the EU will receive a notice detailing:

  1. the type of Personal Data to be processed;
  2. the purpose for the processing and a description of how the processing is based on legitimate interests;
  3. the categories of recipients of disclosures of the Personal Data;
  4. the period for which the Personal Data will be stored or the criteria for determining the period;
  5. how Customers and Site Visitors can exercise the rights of access, correction, erasure, objection, and the right to withdraw consent;
  6. the right to file a complaint with an EU Data Protection Authority;
  7. whether the Customer or Site Visitor is obliged to provide the data by statute, contract, or for another reason, and the possible consequences of failing to provide the data; and
  8. whether the Personal Data will be subject to automated processing and, if so, the logic and the consequences of the processing for the data subject.



Such notices will be clear, conspicuous, and readily available to affected EU Persons. A notice will require an unambiguous, affirmative, opt-in consent to the particular use or processing of the EU Personal Data.

_Transfers of Personal Data_  
With respect to transfers of your Personal Data to third-party data processors, we will:

  1. enter into a contract with each relevant data processor;
  2. transfer Personal Data to each such data processor only for limited and specified purposes;
  3. ascertain that the data processor is obligated to provide the Personal Data with at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by applicable law;
  4. take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the data processor effectively processes the Personal Data in a manner consistent with our obligations under applicable law;
  5. require the data processor to notify us if the data processor determines that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by our contract or applicable law; and
  6. upon notice, including under (e) above, take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing of the Personal Data by the data processor.



#### 3.3. Access

You generally have the right to access your Personal Data. Accordingly, where appropriate, we provide you with reasonable access to the Personal Data we maintain about you. We also provide you a reasonable opportunity to correct, amend, or delete your information.

We may limit these opportunities where the burden or expense of honoring a request would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or where the rights of persons other than you would be violated. Other reasons for denying requests or limiting access include (i) interference with the execution or enforcement of the law or with private causes of action, including the prevention, investigation, or detection of offenses; (ii) breaching a legal or other professional privilege or obligation; and (iii) prejudicing security investigations or grievance proceedings or in connection with succession planning and corporate re-organizations.

Please contact [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to request access to your Personal Data. If access cannot be granted, we will respond with a reason for denying your request.

#### 3.4. Grievance procedure

You may file a complaint concerning our processing of Personal Data by email at [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#94e4e6fde2f5f7edd4f9edf8f1f5f0e7ede7e0f1f9e4e6fbbaf7fbf9). If a failure to comply with this Privacy Policy or other obligations, we will take steps to remedy the issue.

If a complaint regarding Personal Data cannot be resolved through our internal processes, we will cooperate with applicable data protection authorities to address a complaint and provide appropriate recourse.

### 4\. Control and Security

We take measures to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of your information. We carefully limit access to the database in which your personal information is stored. Additionally, we share and transfer your personal information only in the ways set forth in this privacy policy.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on our Content.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. 

We follow industry-standard practices to protect the data we collect and maintain, including Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance and guidelines for SSL/TLS encryption. 

#### 4.1. Data Breach

If a breach of Personal Data occurs, we will notify the relevant authorities within 72 hours, or as otherwise required by applicable law, subject to likelihood of risk to the Customer or Site Visitor. Affected Customers or Site Visitors will also be notified regarding the breach.
