<p>
LiveScore.com, and its affiliates are deeply committed to protecting the
privacy of Internet users. Below is information outlining our continued support for
the responsible management of consumer information.
</p>
<b>Consumer Information</b>
<p>
During the process of delivering an information to you via our website, 
LiveScore.com does not collect any
personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone
number, or e-mail address. However, LiveScore.com may or may not obtain some types of
non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider you
use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, the type of computer
operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example), or what screen resolution
do you use. The information
collected by LiveScore.com is used for the purpose of improving your browsing
experience on our website.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a
survey, registering for an online competiton, signing up for a newsletter 
or personalizing your LiveScore.com pages. 
If this does occur, LiveScore.com will under no circumstances use such
personal information for any purposes other than the ones you have provided 
them for.
</p>
<b>What are cookies and why do we use them ?</b> 
<p>
LiveScore.com, as well as most sites on the Internet, uses "cookies" to enhance your
experience on the web. LiveScore.com cannot use these cookies to personally identify you
in any way. 
</p>
<p>
A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your
browser from a World Wide Web Server. This block of data can be
anything, a unique user ID generated by the server, the current date
and time, the IP Address of where the browser is logged onto the net
or any other chunk of data that you want.
</p>
<p>
After a browser receives a cookie it will then send that cookie
to the server that set it whenever it is appropriate and required/requested. 
The browser will only send the cookie to the server that
originally set it. This means that the server can't tell if your 
browser has cookies that other sites have sent.
</p>
<b>Security &amp; Privacy</b>
<p>
An HTTP Cookie cannot be used to get data from your hard drive, get
your email address or <i>steal</i> sensitive information about your person.
</p>
<p>
The LiveScore.com Web Server(s) will send a Cookie to a Client system when
our adserver serves an ad in order to record unique ID associated with
this ad so that should you decide to click on the ad, your browser
<i>knows</i> which advertiser's web page to redirect you to.
We may or may not also use cookies to enhance your experience on our
website (personalization,...).
</p>
<p>
We believe cookies to be harmless, and will eventually be to everyone's benefit 
(end users, as well as site builders).
</p>
<p>
<b>from The World Wide Web Consortium :</b> 
"Cookies cannot be used to <i>steal</i> information about you or your computer system."
</p>
<p>
If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple procedure to manually
delete your cookies. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for
more information.
</p>
<b>Third party ad serving</b>
<p>
LiveScore.com also works with some other third parties that serve ads to this site
(i.e. Doubleclick, Engage, Realmedia, 24/7, Bostonmedia, Greenroommedia, Sabela,...).
We only choose to use ad serving solutions of companies whose Privacy Policy is in line 
with ours and if you would like to find out more about how they manage the privacy 
of information in conjunction with serving ads on this site, or if you have any additional 
questions about our dedication to consumer privacy,<br> 
please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@livescore.com">info@livescore.com</a>
