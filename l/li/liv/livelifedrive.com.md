## The Type of Information LIVELIFEDRIVE.COM Collects About You 

LIVE LIVE DRIVE collects information that you provide to us or that we learn about you from your use of LIVELIFEDRIVE.COM. We receive and store information you enter on LIVELIFEDRIVE.COM or give to us in any other way. For example, you may provide information to LIVELIFEDRIVE.COM when you register, sign-in, search, add items to your shopping cart, participate in a test profile or survey, request our e-mail newsletters, or communicate with LIVE LIVE DRIVE's customer service. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and personal shopping and product preferences. We also automatically receive and store certain types of information whenever you visit LIVELIFEDRIVE.COM. We might also receive information about you from other sources, such as in providing you special offers that we think will be of interest, and we may add that information to our account information.

## How LIVE LIVE DRIVE Uses Information About You 

We use information we have collected about you to provide you with the very best fashion and personal style news, products and services, and shopping experience. We do not sell your personal information to third parties for any reason. We do not disclose your personal information to unaffiliated third parties who may want to offer you their own products and services unless you have requested or authorized us to do so. We may share your personal information with third parties or affiliates of LIVE LIVE DRIVE where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction or do something you have asked us to do. For example, we might need to provide your personal information to retailers whose merchandise is featured on LIVELIFEDRIVE.COM so they can process and fulfill your request to buy merchandise. We may share your personal information to third parties or affiliates of LIVE LIVE DRIVE with whom we have contracted to perform services on our behalf. All companies that act on our behalf are contractually obligated to keep the personal information we provide to them confidential and to use the personal information we share only to provide the services we ask them to perform. We may disclose personal information about our Visitors as permitted or required by law, such as in connection with a subpoena or similar legal process, or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy, as discussed further below. We try to provide you with the information you need to make informed reasonable choices with respect to how LIVELIFEDRIVE.COM uses or shares your information. LIVE LIVE DRIVE collects and uses personal information from you in several ways:

**Website Usage.** LIVE LIVE DRIVE or LIVE LIVE DRIVE's authorized service providers may observe activities, preferences, and transactional data (such as your IP address, browser type, and operating system) relating to your use of LIVELIFEDRIVE.COM. We may use this collected or logged information in order to provide better service, to facilitate our Visitors' use of the website, to track usage of the website, and to address security hazards. LIVE LIVE DRIVE, or one of LIVE LIVE DRIVE's authorized service providers, may use this information to track aggregate traffic patterns throughout LIVELIFEDRIVE.COM. We may use aggregated, statistical information to describe our customer audience, products and services, and to develop partnerships with third parties to offer products and services in which we believe our Visitors will be interested. For example, if 30 percent of our Visitors are interested in the latest handbags and accessories, we may share that statistic with handbag and accessory retailers in order to offer through LIVELIFEDRIVE.COM the type of merchandise our Visitors want. 

**Online Transactions.** We collect information about you when you use our website. You may visit our site without registering, but if you wish to add merchandise to your shopping cart, take a test, create a shopping book, "Shop Together," or use other special features offered on our site, you will need to provide us with certain information, including your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, to open an account with us. We will assist you in creating a user ID and a password to protect your account information.

At this time, when you request to purchase items in your shopping cart, we will forward your request and basic account information to the retailer or ecommerce service provider. When you provide personal financial and other personally identifiable information to the retailers or service providers featured through LIVELIFEDRIVE.COM, the sales transaction will occur on the retailer's or service provider's site and not on LIVELIFEDRIVE.COM. As such, the financial and personally identifiable information you provide in placing your order is controlled by that retailer or service provider. In the future, LIVELIFEDRIVE.COM may conduct some or all of these sales transactions itself, but at this time, it only facilitates your requests.

If you provide to us information about a friend through the "Invite a Friend" section of LIVELIFEDRIVE.COM, we will first contact that friend by e-mail to confirm that the friend wishes to participate in LIVELIFEDRIVE.COM activities and consents to having personal information about him or her collected and retained by LIVELIFEDRIVE.COM. If your friend does not consent to our use of his or her contact information, we will delete it from our records.

LIVE LIVE DRIVE may offer Open Group Tests ("OGT"). To take our OGT, you and any of your friends who may wish to participate must be registered with LIVELIFEDRIVE.COM. Through our comparative scorecard, LIVE LIVE DRIVE will allow you to create a list of your friends and to compare your results with theirs. It works like this: You tell us whom to invite; our technology invites them on your behalf to participate in the OGT. Once your friend takes the test, you will receive an e-mail notice from LIVE LIVE DRIVE that his or her results are in. On the "results" page, which every invited participant can access and review, you can see their OGT results, first name, and e-mail address, and how you match up in certain categories. You can view your "personal invitation list" and who has yet to participate. The personal invitation list can only be seen by you as the inviter.

Our "Shop Together" feature operates in a similar fashion. Each friend that you ask us to invite on your behalf to shop together with you must also be registered with LIVELIFEDRIVE.COM. We will e-mail you when your friend is ready to shop or is done shopping. You both will be able to view and compare each other's shopping selections. 

**Public Areas.** Any information disclosed in public areas of LIVELIFEDRIVE.COM is public information that may be viewed and collected by any party. We cannot control the use of information disclosed in the social networking, chat rooms, reviews, or bulletin board portions of our site. You should exercise caution when disclosing information, including photos or images, in these public areas and should refrain from disclosing personally identifying information. If you wish to use some of the public portions on our site, we will direct you to first create a public ID, which is not your real e-mail address, before you can post information to our site. LIVE LIVE DRIVE reserves the right to remove any information at any time from our site that we deem inappropriate or for any other reason. 

## Our Security Practices 

Our internal data security policies restrict access to Visitors' personal information to authorized employees. Authorized employees may use our Visitors' personal information for LIVE LIVE DRIVE business purposes only. Our employees are bound by LIVE LIVE DRIVE policies that require them to maintain the confidentiality of our Visitors' personal information. Employees who violate these requirements are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that are designed to guard our Visitors' personal information. For example, for the security of your online visit to LIVELIFEDRIVE.COM, we may make use of firewall barriers, encryption techniques, and/or authentication procedures. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, LIVE LIVE DRIVE cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your personal information, we will notify you as necessary so you can take appropriate protective steps. Unless you indicate otherwise, we may notify you under such circumstances using the e-mail address you provided to us when you registered with LIVELIFEDRIVE.COM.
