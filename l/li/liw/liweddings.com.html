Internet cookies save data about individual visitors, such as the visitor’s name, password, user-name, shopping cart, screen preferences, the pages of a site viewed by the visitor, and the advertisements viewed or clicked by the visitor. When the visitor revisits LIWeddings' Web site, LIWeddings may recognize the visitor by the Internet cookie and customize the visitor’s experience accordingly. Visitors may decline Internet cookies, if any, by using the appropriate feature of their Web client software, if available.</p>

<p align="justify">When a visitor performs a search within LIWeddings' Web site, LIWeddings may record information identifying the visitor or linking the visitor to the search performed.

<p align="justify">2. Use of Personal Data Collected</p>

<p align="justify">Personal data collected by LIWeddings may be used by LIWeddings for editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of users’ behavior, for product development, for content improvement, to inform advertisers as to how many visitors have seen or clicked on their advertisements, or to customize the content and layout of LIWeddings' site. Aggregate data on visitors’ home servers may be used for internal purposes or provided to third parties such as advertisers. Individually identifying information, such as names, postal and e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information which visitors voluntarily provide to LIWeddings may be (i) added to LIWeddings' databases and used for future calls and mailings regarding site updates, new products and services, upcoming events, and status of orders placed online, or (ii) provided to reputable third parties who provide products and services which LIWeddings believes that visitors may be interested in purchasing or obtaining, with prior notice to the visitor.</p>

<p align="justify">3. Disclosure of Personal Data to Third Parties</p>

<p align="justify">Any third party to which LIWeddings shares, rents, sells, or otherwise discloses personal data will be under a contractual obligation to use the personal data for marketing products and services which LIWeddings determines, in its sole judgment, that visitors might find of interest. LIWeddings will use its reasonable efforts to identify such third parties who may have products or services of interest to visitors to LIWeddings' site. However, such parties are independent third parties over which LIWeddings exercises no control, and therefore LIWeddings is not responsible for their conduct, products, or services, and will not be liable therefor.

In particular, when a visitor places an order on this site (if any) or accesses his or her account information (if any), LIWeddings offers the visitor the ability to use a secure server. The secure server encrypts all information a visitor inputs before it is sent to LIWeddings, and is also used to securely store personal information.

<p align="justify">6. Access to and Ability to Correct Personal Data</p>

<p align="justify">Upon request via postal mail, e-mail, or phone, LIWeddings will provide to visitors a summary of any personal information retained by LIWeddings regarding the visitor.

If registration is required for any services on the LIWeddings Site, and a user submits information to LIWeddings' Web site as part of the registration process which indicates that such user is a child, the child’s parent or guardian will receive an e-mail alerting them to the child’s registration and providing instructions on how the parent can delete the child’s registration, if so desired. No information collected through LIWeddings' Web site from users self- identified as children will knowingly be used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside LIWeddings. If there are no age restrictions on a contest which requires registration, and if a child wins, notification and prizes will be sent to the parent(s) or guardian(s) identified in the initial registration process. </p>
