**Information Collection and Use**  
As a ValueClick Company, ValueClick Media is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. Information collected is in two distinct categories: Member information and aggregated Web User information. This portion of ValueClick Media’s privacy statement applies only to Members of ValueClick Media. For web user privacy issues regarding the serving of advertisements and the use of cookies, please see the Web User Privacy Statement. 

Members of the ValueClick Media Network include publishers and advertisers involved in advertising campaign transactions. Member information collected includes personally identifiable information that is necessary to conduct business, such as name, phone number, and email address. Payments made to and from ValueClick Media require the collection of personally identifiable information that may include credit card numbers and bank account information. Phone numbers may be used to contact Members for sales or inventory acquisition purposes. All Member information is collected, modified and stored in a password protected environment. This information is used for service, media delivery, contact, billing and accounts payable purposes. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to non-ValueClick entities. All Member information collection is explicit, voluntary, manually entered by the Member, and can be opted-out. 

Cookies are used to simplify Member login and to facilitate secure navigation through the password protected areas of the website. Members who choose to reject all cookies may have difficulty navigating the password protected areas of the website depending on the nature of their connection (dynamic IP, proxy server, etc.).

Information Sharing**  
Member information is not shared with any third party outside ValueClick Media and its affiliated companies within ValueClick, except for that necessary to conduct business, such as clearing a credit card transaction for an advertising campaign purchase or making an ACH direct deposit to pay a Publisher, or as required by law. The security of Member information is crucial to our success in the highly competitive field of online advertising. ValueClick Media may, from time to time, use "gallery" pages to identify Publishers and Advertisers by business identity ONLY (e.g. Adcycle.com is a new Member of the ValueClick Media Network).

We record the IP address of new Members at sign-up. This can assist in administering the website and Member accounts, including the possible implementation of "fast-login" and "my ValueClick Media " features designed to enhance the Member experience.
