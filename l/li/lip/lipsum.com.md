lipsum.com is committed to protecting your privacy online. This Privacy Policy endeavours to describe to you our practices
regarding the personal information we collect from users on our website, located at lipsum.com (the “Site”), and the services offered
through the Site. If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, our collection practices, the processing of user information, or
if you would like to report a security violation to us directly, please contact us at help@lipsum.com
What Data We Collect
General Data: The use of our services will automatically create information that will be collected. For example, when you use our
Services, your geographic location, how you use the Services, information about the type of device you use, your Open Device
Identification Number, date/time stamps for your visit, your unique device identifier, your browser type, operating system, Internet
Protocol (IP) address, and domain name are all collected. This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant
information to you and administer and improve the Site.
Log Files: As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes
IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and
clickstream data. We use this information to maintain and improve the performance of the Services.
Analytics: We use analytics services (including, but not limited to, Google Analytics) to help analyze how users use the Site.
Analytics services use Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site and we use the information to improve
our Site and Services. The analytics services' ability to use and share information collected by them is restricted by their terms of
use and privacy policy, which you should refer to for more information about how these entities use this information.
Location Information: If you have enabled location services on your mobile device, we may collect your location information to
improve the Services we offer. If you do not want this information collected, you can disable location services on your device.
Cookies: “Cookies” are small pieces of information (text files) that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are
viewing the website. These text files can be used by websites to make the users experience more efficient. The law states that we
can store these cookies on your device if they are strictly necessary for the operation of this site. For all other types of cookies we
need your permission. To that end, this site uses different types of cookies. Some cookies are placed by third party services that
appear on our pages. We and some third parties may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser)
and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive
experience on our Services and to market the Services or other products. Marketing cookies are used to track visitors across
websites. The intention is to display ads that are relevant and engaging for the individual user and thereby more valuable for
publishers and third party advertisers. This tracking is done on an anonymous basis and, while not an exhaustive list, some of the
companies we work with are Google, AppNexus, Criteo, Rubicon, Pubmatic and DistrictM. To learn more about this practice,
including the Self Regulatory Principles for Online Advertising, to which we adhere, you can visit www.aboutads.info/choices,
optout.networkadvertising.org and www.youronlinechoices.com
