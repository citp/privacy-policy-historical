					<p>Thank you for visiting the LIPA Web site. We hope your visit 
					is helpful and informative.</p>
					<p>This Web site is designed to make it easier and more efficient 
					for visitors to learn about and interact with LIPA. Like all 
					online resources, we recognize that Web site visitors are concerned 
					about issues of privacy and security of information and the 
					quality and accuracy of the information presented. LIPA is committed 
					to preserving your privacy and security while visiting our Internet 
					site, and to giving you the most accurate information possible.</p>
					<p>Information provided on this Web site is intended to allow 
					the visitor access to public information, and does not represent 
					business, legal or other advice. While all attempts are made 
					to provide accurate, current and reliable information, LIPA 
					recognizes the possibility of human and/or mechanical error. 
					LIPA makes no representations as to the accuracy, completeness, 
					currency or suitability of the information provided by this 
					Web site, and deny any expressed or implied warranty as to the 
					same. In offering that information, LIPA, its affiliates, agents 
					and contractors assume no responsibility or liability. Reference 
					in this web site to any specific commercial products, processes, 
					or services, or the use of any trade, firm or corporation name 
					is for the information and convenience of the public, and does 
					not constitute endorsement, recommendation, or favoring by LIPA, 
					its employees or agents.</p>
					<p>This policy describes LIPA’s privacy practices regarding 
					information collected from visitors to this Web site. In addition, 
					this policy describes what data is collected and how that information 
					is used. LIPA may, at its sole discretion, change, modify, add 
					or delete portions of this policy. Because this privacy policy 
					only applies to this Web site, you should examine the privacy 
					policy of any Web site, including other State Web sites you 
					access through this Web site.</p>
					<p><b>Information Collected When You Visit This Web site<br>
					</b>When visiting this Web site, LIPA automatically collects 
					and stores the following information about your visit:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The Internet Protocol address and domain name of your 
						Internet service provider. The Internet Protocol address 
						is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet 
						service provider or directly to your computer, which can 
						be used to direct internet traffic to you;</li>
						<li>The type of browser and operating system you used;</li>
						<li>The date and time you visited this site;</li>
						<li>The web pages or services you accessed at this site 
						and the files that you downloaded; </li>
						<li>The URL or address of the Web site you visited prior 
						to coming to this Web site and from which any web page on 
						this site was linked.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This information is used to improve this Web site’s content 
					and to help LIPA understand how people are using this Web site. 
					This information is collected for statistical analysis, to determine 
					what information is of most and least interest to our visitors, 
					and to identify system performance or problem areas. This information 
					is not collected for commercial marketing purposes and LIPA 
					does not sell or distribute the information collected from the 
					Web site for commercial marketing purposes. The information 
					is retained in accordance with the public record retention provisions 
					in the State Arts and Cultural Affairs Law.</p>
					<p><b>Information Collected When You Access LIPA Services E-mail 
					or This Site <br>
					</b>This Web site provides access to some LIPA customer services. 
					Information that you submit when accessing customer services 
					will be collected. If during your visit to this Web site, you 
					access a customer service or send an e-mail to LIPA, your e-mail 
					address and the contents of your e-mail or communication will 
					also be collected. The information collected is not limited 
					to text characters and may include audio, video and graphic 
					information formats that you send to LIPA. <br>
					<br>
					The information contained in your e-mail or communication will 
					be used to access customer services, respond to you, address 
					that issues you identify, further improve this Web site, or 
					forward your e-mail or communication to another agency or entity 
					for appropriate action. Information received by LIPA from your

					<p><b>Personal Information and Choice<br>
					</b>"Personal Information" is information about an individual 
					(e.g., an individual’s name, address and phone number). A domain 
					name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal 
					information. </p>
					<p>Personal information is not collected through this Web site 
					unless you voluntarily provide it by directly communicating 
					with LIPA. If you do not communicate with this Web site it does 
					not affect your ability to use any of the other features of 
					this Web site. </p>
					<p>LIPA does not knowingly collect personal information from 
					children or create profiles of children through this Web site. 
					LIPA cautions that the collection of personal information provided 
					by any individual in an e-mail will be treated the same as information 
					given by an adult, and may, if not protected by federal or State 
					law, be subject to public access. LIPA encourages parents and 
					teachers to be involved in children’s Internet activities and 
					guide the children whenever children are asked to provide personal 
					information on-line.</p>
					<p><b>Disclosure of Information Collected Through This Web site<br>
					</b>If not protected by federal or State law, personal information 
					collected through this Web site may be subject to disclosure 
					pursuant to law, such as the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL), 
					the Personal Privacy Protection Law (PPPL), the federal Children’s 
					Online Privacy Protection Act, court order, subpoena or other 
					legal process. In addition, LIPA may disclose personal information 
					to federal or State law enforcement authorities to enforce its 
					rights against unauthorized access or attempted unauthorized 
					access to LIPA’s information.</p>
					<p><b>Cookies<br>
					</b>To better serve you, we occasionally use "cookies" to enhance 
					or customize your visit to this Web site. Cookies created on 
					the device you use to access this Web site do not contain personally 
					identifiable information, and do not compromise your privacy 
					and security. We use the cookie feature to store a randomly 
					generated identifying tag on the device you use to access this 
					Web site. The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet 
					Web sites. The software and hardware you use to access this 
					Web site allows you to refuse the cookie or delete the cookie 
					file at any time.</p>
					<p><b>Security</b><br>
					LIPA limits employee access to personally identifiable information 
					from this Web site to only those employees who need access to 
					perform a specific job. Security measures have been integrated 
					into the design, implementation, and day-to-day operations of 
					this Web site as part of LIPA’s continuing commitment to the 
					security of electric content as well as the electronic transmission 
					of information.</p>
					<p>The information contained in this policy should not be construed 
					in any way as giving business, legal or other advice, or warranting 
					as fail proof, the security of information provided via this 
					Web site. For site security purposes and to ensure that this 
					Web site remains available to all users, LIPA employs software 
					to monitor traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload 
					or change information or otherwise cause damage to this Web 
					site. </p>
					<p><b>Links Disclaimer<br>
					</b>In order to provide visitors with certain information, this 
					Web site provides links to local, State and federal government 
					agencies, and Web sites of other entities. A link does not constitute 
					an endorsement of the content, viewpoint, accuracy, opinions, 
					policy, products, services, or accessibility of that Web site. 
					Once you link to another Web site from this Web site, including 
					one maintained by the State, you are subject to the terms and 
					conditions of that Web site, including, but not limited to, 
					its privacy policy. </p>
					<p><b><a name="Podcasts">Podcasts</a></b><br>
					LIPA’s podcasting service (the "Podcast Service") consists of 
					news and information audio files (the "Podcast Content") that 
					may be downloaded from LIPA’s web site (“Site”) to your computer 
					and/or transferred to your portable MP3 player. </p>
					<p>These Terms of Use and LIPA’s Privacy Policy govern your 
					use of the Podcasting Service. Any uses of the Podcasting Service 
					not granted herein are strictly prohibited. Prohibited uses 
					include, but are not limited to, the incorporation of advertising 
					or the placement of advertising associated with or targeted 
					at the Podcast Content, redistribution of the Podcast Content 
					and the use of the Podcast Content in a manner which suggests 
					or implies that LIPA endorses any products, services or causes 
					of a third party. You may not edit or modify the Podcast Content 
					or links in any manner whatsoever.</p>
					<p>You may only use the Podcasting Service with platforms which 
					provide a functional link that, when accessed, takes the user 
					directly to the podcast feed on the Site. The Podcast Content 
					may be used only in a manner which allows linking or redirection 
					to or delivery of the applicable page on the Site. You may not 
					display the Podcast Content in a manner that does not permit 
					successful linking to, redirection to or delivery of the applicable 
					LIPA Site web page. You may not insert any intermediate page, 
					splash page or any other content between the podcast link and 
					the applicable page on the Site. LIPA retains all ownership 
					and other rights in the Podcast Content and in any and all LIPA 
					logos and trademarks used in connection with the Podcasting 
					Service. If applicable, you must provide attribution to the 
					appropriate page on the Site in connection with your use of 
					the Podcasting Service, and, if you use a graphic in the attribution, 
					you must use the appropriate LIPA logo incorporated into the 
					Podcast Content.</p>
					<p>Any suggestions, comments or other feedback ("Feedback") 
					offered to LIPA with respect to the Podcast Service is and will 
					be given entirely voluntarily. LIPA shall be free to use, disclose, 
					reproduce, license or otherwise distribute and exploit Feedback 
					provided to it as it sees fit. </p>
					<p>LIPA reserves the right to cease offering any or all of the 
					Podcasting Service or Podcast Content at any time or to require 
					you to cease any and all use of the Podcasting Service or Podcast 
					Content at any time for any reason. LIPA assumes no liability 
					for your activities in connection with the Podcasting Service 
					or for your use of the Podcast Content in connection with your 
					website, computer or MP3 player.</p>
