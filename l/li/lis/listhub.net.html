        <p><b>Our Commitment to Privacy —</b> Threewide's Privacy Policy
          was developed as an extension of our commitment to combine the highest-quality
          products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing
          with our clients and partners. The Policy is designed to assist you
          in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information
          you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when
          using our site and our products and services. This statement will be
          continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices
          and our customers' needs. </p>
        <p></p>
<p><b>What
              Information Do We Collect? — </b>When you visit our Web site
              you may provide us with two types of information: personal information
              you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual
              basis; and Web site use information collected on an aggregate basis
          as you and others browse our Web site.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Personal
                Information You Choose to Provide</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Name</li>
              <li>Mailing address</li>
              <li>Email address</li>
              <li>Home and business phone number</li>
              <li>Billing information</li>
              <li>Other personal or business related information</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>E-mail
                Information — </b>If you choose to correspond with us through
                e-mail, we may retain the content of your e-mail messages together
                with your e-mail address and our responses. We provide the same
                protections for these electronic communications that we employ
            in the maintenance of information received by mail and telephone.</li>
          <li><b>Web
                Site Use Information  — </b>Similar to other commercial
                Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies"
            (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") and Web server
            logs to collect information about how our Web site is used. Information
            gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date
            and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site,
            and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site.
            This information is collected on an aggregate basis. None of this
            information is associated with you as an individual.  </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>How
              Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us? — </b>Broadly
              speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering
              our business activities, providing customer service and making
              available other products and services to our customers and prospective
              customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect
              to notify you about important changes to our Web site, new services
              and special offers we think you will find valuable. The lists used
              to send you product and service offers are developed and managed
              under our traditional corporate standards designed to safeguard
              the security and privacy of our customers' personal information.
              As a customer, you will be given the opportunity, at least once
          annually, to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers.  </p>
        <p><b>What
              Are Cookies? — </b>Cookies are a feature of Web browser software
              that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access
              a Web site. They are small pieces of data that are stored by a
              user's Web browser on the user's hard drive. Cookies can remember
              what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent
              interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the
              information to streamline the user's transactions on related Web
              pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from Web page to
              Web page and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet.
              Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized.  </p>
        <p><b>How
              Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies? — </b>We use
              Web site browser software tools such as cookies and Web server
              logs to gather information about our Web site users' browsing activities
              in order to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our
              customers. This information assists us to design and arrange our
              Web pages in the most user-friendly manner and to continually improve
              our Web site to better meet the needs of our customers and prospective
              customers.  Cookies
            help us collect important business and technical statistics. The
            information in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by
            users to our Web site as they move from one page to another. Web
            server logs allow us to count how many people visit our Web site
            and evaluate our Web site's visitor capacity. We do not use these
            technologies to capture your individual e-mail address or any personally
            identifying information about you although they do permit us to
            send focused online banner advertisements or other such responses
            to you.</p>
        <p><b>Sharing
                Information with Affiliates — </b>From time to time you
                may notice offers from outside companies advertised on our Web
                site. We take measures to select product or service providers
                that are responsible and afford privacy protections to their
                customers. However, we cannot make any representations about
          the practices and policies of these companies.</p>
        <p><b>Sharing
                Information with Strategic Partners</b><b> —</b> We may
                enter into strategic marketing alliances or partnerships with
                third parties who may be given access to personal information
                including your name, address, telephone number and e-mail for
                the purpose of providing you information regarding products and
                services that we think will be of interest to you. In connection
                with strategic marketing alliances or partnerships, we will retain
                all ownership rights to the information, and we will not share
                information regarding your social security number or other personal
          financial data.  </p>
        <p><b>Notice
              of New Services and Changes</b> <b> —</b> Occasionally, we
              may also use the information we collect to notify you about important
              changes to our Web site, new services and special offers we think
              you will find valuable. As our client, you will be given the opportunity
              to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers by clicking
              on a response box when you receive such an offer or by sending
          us an e-mail request to the address provided.  </p>
        <p><b>How
              Do We Secure Information Transmissions?</b><b> —</b> When
              you send confidential personal credit card information to us on
              our Web site, we use https secure protocol which encrypts the transmission
            of the data.  </p>
        <p>Other
          e-mail that you may send to us may not be secure unless we advise
          you that security measures will be in place prior to your transmitting
          the information. For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential
          information such as Social Security or account numbers to us through
          an unsecured e-mail. </p>
        <h2>How
            Do We Protect Your Information?  </h2>
        <p><b>Information
              Security</b><b> —</b> We utilize encryption/security software
              to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information we collect
              from unauthorized access or disclosure and accidental loss, alteration
              or destruction.</p>
        <p> <b>Evaluation
              of Information Protection Practices</b><b> —</b> Periodically,
              our operations and business practices are reviewed for compliance
              with corporate policies and procedures governing the security,
          confidentiality and quality of our information.  </p>
        <p><b>Employee
              Access, Training and Expectations</b><br>
Our corporate values, ethical standards, policies and practices are committed
to the protection of customer information. In general, our business practices
limit employee access to confidential information, and limit the use and disclosure
of such information to authorized persons, processes and transactions.</p>

              Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</b><b> —</b> You
              may request access to all your personally identifiable information
          that we collect online and maintain in our database by e-mailing.</p>
        <p><b>Do
              We Disclose Information to Outside Parties? — </b>We may
              provide aggregate information about our customers, sales, Web site
              traffic patterns and related Web site information to our affiliates
              or reputable third parties, but this information will not include
              personally identifying data, except as otherwise provided in this
          Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p> <b>What
              About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information? — </b>We
              may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other
              words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it
          or for the protection of our legal rights.</p>
        <p><b>What
              About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site? — </b>We are
