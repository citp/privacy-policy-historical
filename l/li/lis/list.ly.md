# Privacy - Listly

By using Listly (the “Website”), you are agreeing to the collection and use of your personal information as described below. We will notify all active accounts of any significant changes to this policy. 

This website ([Listly](http://list.ly/)) is owned and operated by Boomy Labs We take user privacy seriously and make reasonable efforts to protect your privacy. We have created this Privacy Policy in order to share with you our information collection and use practices. Please read this policy carefully before sharing any personally identifiable information described below. This policy applies solely to the Website located at [Listly](http://list.ly/) (the Website). 

## What information does Listly collect?

In connection with your use of the Website, we ask for and may collect a variety of information from you in different ways. 

Listly uses OAuth, an open protocol, as the method to interact with protected data from Twitter and/or Facebook. We do not have access to your Twitter or Facebook passwords. 

In order to register or use certain portions of the Website, you may be asked for, or you may choose to provide, certain personally identifiable information (PII) such as name, email address, postal address, photo and similar information. We will not collect PII from you while you use the Website unless you voluntarily provide it to us or authorize us to collect such information. 

We collect and track certain non-personally identifiable (non-PII) information, including but not limited to, user IP numbers and browser type, access times, domain names, usage habits and other information which does not specifically identify any individual. 

## Cookies

"Cookies" are pieces of information that may be placed on your computer by a website for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with that website. We may use cookies to customize your use of the Website and for other purposes to improve your use of the Website, and may also use web beacons, web bugs, action tags and third party cookies. You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or flush them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences, in which case you may still use our Website, but it may interfere with some of its functionality. We do not use cookies to automatically retrieve PII from your computer without your knowledge. 

## Use of Your Information

Listly may use or disclose PII to operate and manage the Website, to provide services that you have requested or respond to your other inquires or requests. We may also disclose PII in the establishment or exercise of legal rights or defense against legal claims, to comply with applicable laws or regulations, to comply with a valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order or to investigate suspected fraud or a violation of Listly's Terms of Service. 

We may share aggregated data and statistics in order to describe our Website and services to partners, advertisers and other third parties for lawful purposes. 

Because Listly enables people to interact and share crowd-sourced content using their Twitter or Facebook account, we share your Twitter and Facebook username and any social interaction around your activity on Listly. This includes lists created, shared, or discussed on Listly. 

## No Children Under The Age of 18

You must be 13 years and older to register to use the Listly Website. We have no intention of collecting PII from children under the age of 13. When we become aware that PII from a child under 13 has been collected without such child's parent or guardian's consent, we will use all reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database. We recommend that minors between the ages of 13 and 18 ask and receive their parents' permission before using Listly or sending information about themselves or anyone else over the Internet. 

## Additional Privacy Information

Please remember that any information you voluntarily disclose on-line, in any message postings or conversations, may be collected and used by others without your permission. Furthermore, if you provide any information to parties who provide websites that are linked to or from our Website, different rules may apply to their collection, use or disclosure of your personal information.
