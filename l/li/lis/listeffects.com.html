<h5>Welcome to List Effects  (the "Site")</h5>
<p>We understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site, especially when conducting business. <br> This statement governs our privacy policies with respect to those users of the Site ("Visitors") who visit without transacting business and Visitors who make use of the advertising services offered by List Effects  (collectively, "Advertisers") and Visitors who register in the Program ("Authorized Subscribers").</p>

We collect the following additional information from our Authorized Subscribers: the names, addresses, and email addresses of Authorized Subscribers. If the Visitor came through a referral link, we will attempt to store a cookie on their browser that indicates who referred them.  This is to provide credit to the Authorized Member if the Visitor joins.</p>
<h5>What organizations are collecting the information? </h5>
<p>In addition to our direct collection of information, our third party service vendors (such as credit card companies, clearinghouses and banks) who may provide such services as payment processing of purchased advertising may collect this information from our Advertisers. We do not control how these third parties use such information, but we do ask them to disclose how they use personal information provided to them from Advertisers. Some of these third parties may be intermediaries that act solely as links in the distribution chain, and do not store, retain, or use the information given to them.</p>
<h5>How does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information?</h5>
<p>We use Personally Identifiable Information to customize the Site, to make appropriate service offerings, and to fulfill advertising requests on the Site. We may email Authorized Subscribers about research or advertising opportunities on the Site or information related to the subject matter of the Site. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to contact Authorized Subscribers in response to specific inquiries, or to provide requested information.</p>

<h5>How is Personally Identifiable Information stored?</h5>

<h5>What choices are available to Visitors regarding collection, use and distribution of the information?</h5>

<h5>Are Cookies Used on the Site?</h5>
<p>Cookies are used for a variety of reasons. We use Cookies to obtain information about the preferences of our Visitors and the services they select. We also use Cookies for security purposes to protect our Authorized Subscribers. For example, if an Authorized Customer is logged on, cookies are used for session authentication.</p>
<h5>How does List Effects  use login information? </h5>

We will also disclose Personally Identifiable Information when reasonably necessary to protect the safety of our Visitors, Advertisers, and Authorized Subscribers.</p>
<h5>How does the Site keep Personally Identifiable Information secure?</h5>
<p>All of our employees are familiar with our security policy and practices.

<h5>Can a Visitor delete or deactivate Personally Identifiable Information collected by the Site?</h5>
<p>We provide Visitors, Advertisers, and Authorized Subscribers with a mechanism to delete/deactivate Personally Identifiable Information from the Site's database by contacting admin at listeffects dot com. However, because of backups and records of deletions, it may be impossible to delete a Visitor's entry without retaining some residual information. An individual who requests to have Personally Identifiable Information deactivated will have this information functionally deleted.</p>
<h5>What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes?</h5>
<p>We will let our Visitors, Advertisers, and Authorized Subscribers know about changes to our privacy policy by posting such changes on the Site. However, if we are changing our privacy policy in a manner that might cause disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information that a Visitor, Advertiser, or Authorized Customer has previously requested not be disclosed, we will contact such Visitor, Advertiser, or Authorized Customer to allow such Visitor, Advertiser or Authorized Customer to prevent such disclosure.</p>
