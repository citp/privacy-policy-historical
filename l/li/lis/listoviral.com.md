A cookie on the web is a text file that a website’s computer asks your computer to store that file. The text file will then sit on your computer’s hard drive.

Cookies are useful for website owners and advertisers to better understand you. If you are one of the people who complains about not seeing target advertising, you should seriously consider allowing permissions for cookies. It’s the cookie that pings back keywords to ad sources which then try and match those keywords with a subject you are interested in. A person like yourself always has control on allowing or disabling cookies; however, turning the cookies off will result in it being impossible for us and our advertising partners such as Google to know what might interest you.
