**Listen360 Privacy Policy**

**_Last Modified: February 21, 2019_**

This Privacy Policy (“ **Policy** ”) discloses the privacy practices for www.listen360.com (including all sub-domains, the  **“Sites”** ), which are owned and operated by Listen360, Inc. ( **“Listen360,” “our,” “we”**  or  **“us”** ), as well as the use of the Listen360 web-based customer feedback system and services (collectively, the “ **Web App** ”). The Sites and Web App may be referred to as our “ **Services.** ”  This Privacy Policy applies to our collection, use and disclosure of your information from our Services, including, without limitation, visitors to the Sites and unpaid users of the Services. This Policy is incorporated into our  **Terms of Service** and [Terms of Use](https://www.listen360.com/terms-of-use/).

Please review the privacy policies of any third parties before you disclose information to them.

  2. **CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**



We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time and without prior notice to you. Changes may apply to any personal information we already hold about you and any new personal information collected after the Policy is modified. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the “Last Modified” date at the top of this Policy which will always be at [listen360.com/privacy-policy.html](https://www.listen360.com/privacy-policy/). By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.

In addition, we may provide you with “just-in-time” disclosures or additional information about the data handling practices of specific parts of our Services. Such notices may supplement this Policy or provide you with additional choices about how we process your personal information.

  3. **OUR RELATIONSHIP TO YOU**



To understand Listen360’s data protection obligations and your rights to your personal information under this Policy, it is important that you identify which relationship(s) you have with Listen360.

  * “ **Clients** ” refers to the registered users of the Listen360 Services including Clients with both paid and free or trial accounts, on whose behalf Listen360 solicits, collects and reports voluntary feedback provided to us by the Client’s customers with respect to the Client and its products and services. Authorized users of a Client’s Listen360 paid, free, and/or demo accounts are collectively and individually referred to as “Client Users.” 

Listen360 has a service provider relationship with Clients, and acts as a “data processor” when it stores, processes, transmits, or otherwise shares the consumer data it solicits and collects on behalf of the Client.  Listen360 is in a “data controller” or direct relationship with Client Users.



  * “ **Respondents** ” refers to individuals doing business with a Client utilizing Listen360 Services to solicit feedback from them. If you are a Respondent, Listen360 will collect and share your Personal Information solely on behalf of a Client, and solely based on the instructions provided by the Client (in conjunction with any instruction you may have the opportunity to provide at the time feedback is provided). Your agreement with the relevant Client should explain how the Client shares your Personal Information with Listen360 and other third parties, and if you have questions about this sharing, then you should direct those questions to the Client.


  * “ **Visitors** ” refers to any individual accessing the Sites, as well as to any individual submitting Personal Information via the Sites for any reason, including but not limited to submitting a “contact us” or other online inquiry form, subscribing to a newsletter or blog, registering for a demo or webinar, or completing an online survey. Listen360 is in a “data controller” or direct relationship with Visitors.



Hereinafter we may refer to Clients, Respondents, and Visitors individually and collectively as “you.”

  4. **COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**



For purposes of this policy, “Personal Information” refers to any information about an identified or identifiable individual, including financial account information, Protected Health Information (PHI/ePHI), and any device information that may be linked with an identifiable individual.

We collect Personal Information from and about Visitors to our Sites, we collect Personal Information from and about Clients and Client Users through our Sites and Services, and we collect Personal Information from and about Respondents and other individuals who do business with and provide feedback about Clients that use our Services.

Parts of our Sites are public, such as our blog, and any information that is disclosed on such public parts of our Sites may appear on search engines or other publicly available platforms, and may be “crawled,” searched and used by other Visitors, Clients, Client Users, Respondents, or other third parties.

User sessions originating from an EU or UK IP address are provided the opportunity to opt-out of these analytics and marketing cookies.

For detailed information on the types of cookies used by Listen360, and your cookie management options, please read our [Cookie Policy](https://www.listen360.com/cookie-policy/).

  7. **THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATED SERVICES**



Listen360 provides the ability to integrate the Services with select third party systems for importing and synchronization of customer information or publishing of feedback content (“Integrated Service(s)”). When a Client elects to establish a Listen360 connection with an Integrated Service, all data in your account may be shared with the Integrated Service (and all data in the Integrated Service account may be shared with Listen360) including personally identifiable information about your consumer and non-consumer customers and prospects. Listen360 does not control the policies or procedures of these Integrated Services, even though the integrations are provided through our Services, and Listen360 is not responsible for and has no control over how these third party Integrated Services function.

This Policy does not cover the collection or use of information, including consumer Respondent data, by Integrated Services, and Clients acknowledge that use and access to these Integrated Services is solely at their own risk; and Clients should consult the Terms and Privacy Policy for any Integrated Services accessed via a Listen360 account to determine how they store, process, transmit, and otherwise utilize and protect personally identifiable information and the personally identifiable information Clients provide about their customers, prospects, and other consumers. Clients ultimately can control which Integrated Services they choose to use with their Listen360 account, and are responsible for making sure that they do so in compliance with relevant privacy and data protection requirements.

Listen360 may provide the Personal Information we have collected from and/or about Clients to Integrated Services for the purpose of enabling them to market their products or services to you, if you have not opted out of these disclosures.

  8. **HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION**



Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy or in accordance with any request or consent you provide, Listen360 does not sell, share, or in any other way transmit Personal Information (names, address, phone numbers, financial account information, Protected Health Information (PHI/ePHI), etc.) submitted by Respondents to any persons or companies other than the Client on whose behalf the feedback was solicited. We reserve the right, however, to use and disclose anonymous information to third parties, at our discretion. Except as limited below, third parties may use information we share with them for any purpose for which we may use such information.

Personal Information we collect from Visitors, Clients, Client Users, and Respondents may be shared with service providers who provide certain services on our behalf, including but not limited to, identity verification, fraud prevention, business intelligence, customer relationship management, bill collection, payment processing, marketing, hosting, and other common technology services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and you consent to our sharing with these parties by using our Sites and Services and accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy.

We may provide information, including Personal Information of Clients and Client Users to third party service providers and referral partners that work on behalf of or with us to provide some of the aspects of our services, to help us communicate with you, or to provide Clients with ancillary services offered by such service providers and referral partners. We may also receive information about you, including Personal Information, from our third party service providers and referral partners. However, these service providers and referral partners do not have any independent right to disclose this information (except to the same extent we would have a right to disclose that information under this Privacy Policy).

When you provide feedback about a Client via the Services, we share all of the information you provide, including Personal Information, with that Client.

When you submit any feedback form or survey, you are providing explicit consent to publically publish in any forum or format any and all of the information provided via the form (including both checkbox/radio button selections and free text comments) in conjunction with your first and last initials.

You hereby agree that we may share some or all of your Personal Information with our Affiliates. We will require our Affiliates to comply with this Privacy Policy. If our company or some or all of our assets are acquired by another company, any personal or other information we possess may be a part of the assets transferred, and that company will possess any rights granted to us under this Privacy Policy.

Finally, in extraordinary circumstances, we may share any personal or other information we possess, including but not limited to credit card and other financial account information and Protected Health Information (PHI/ePHI) when necessary or appropriate to: comply with the law; cooperate with law enforcement or national security requirements; respond to subpoenas;  respond to lawful requests; comply with law or credit card rules; participate in a lawful federal, state or local government investigation; protect the rights of Listen360, other Listen360 Clients, Client Users, and Respondents, and third parties; or to investigate violations of or to enforce our Terms of Service or Terms of Use. However, in doing so, we may: (i) dispute demands for release to the extent we believe, in our sole discretion, are unwarranted, illegitimate or overbroad; and (ii) when we determine that it is necessary or appropriate, we will notify you of any requests for release.

In all cases where we share Personal Information with third parties, we will use a “minimum necessary” standard to disclose only that information required to perform the service for which the information is disclosed.

  9. **DATA RETENTION**



We will retain Personal Information for Clients and Client Users as long as you remain an active user of our Services and for a reasonable time thereafter, to serve the purpose(s) for which your Personal Information was processed, or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, or to enforce our agreements to the extent permitted by law. While retention requirements can vary by country, we generally apply the retention periods noted below.

  * **Respondent Personal Information:** We may store on behalf of Clients, for as long as a valid business reason exists, which may be indefinitely, any Personal Information, including but not limited to Protected Health Information (PHI/ePHI), collected about a consumer or other individual, whether entered directly into our systems by the Respondent via a feedback survey or any other means, whether entered or imported by an authorized Client User, or whether imported via a Client initiated integration with a third party service. 

Note that Clients control any consumer data we collect and process on their behalf and it is up to the Client to determine how long they will store their customers’ Personal Information in our systems.

  * **Your Interactions on Our Services:** We may store any information about your interactions on our Sites or Services or any content created, posted or shared by you on our Sites or Services (e.g., pictures, comments, support tickets, and other content) for a period of time after the closure your account, which may be indefinitely, where a valid business reason exists for such storage such as to maintain the integrity of our systems and logs, for the establishment or defense of legal claims, audit and crime prevention purposes.
  * **Marketing:** We store information used for marketing purposes indefinitely until you unsubscribe. Once you unsubscribe from marketing communications, we add your contact information to our suppression list to ensure we respect your unsubscribe request.
  * **Cookie Data:** We retain any personal information collected via cookies, clear gifs, flash cookies, webpage counters and other technical or analytics tools up to one year from expiry of the cookie or the date of collection. Cookies owned by third parties may have other retention policies. See our [Cookie Policy](https://www.listen360.com/cookie-policy/) for more information.

  * **Anonymized and Aggregate Data:** We may retain anonymized and aggregate data indefinitely.



Upon termination of a contract with a Covered Entity, we will remove any ePHI stored in our systems on behalf of that Covered Entity where required by applicable law or the Business Associate Agreement with the Covered Entity; any PHI that we continue to maintain, will be stored and protected per the terms of our Business Associate Agreement with the Covered Entity.

  10. **SECURITY**



Listen360 has implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on our thirty party vendor’s servers which utilize the most powerful security tools that exist in the marketplace.

The Listen360 Sites, including hosted web feedback survey forms, utilize secure SSL for all form data submissions in conjunction with a 256-bit GoDaddy certificate, but accommodate the majority of browsers at 128-bit encryption.

Listen360 does not directly store, process, or transmit bank account and credit card information. All payment processing, and collection of payment account data, is accomplished via integration with third-party service providers.  These providers are contractually required to maintain compliance with the PCI DSS – Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, and with all NACHA rules for ACH transaction processing.  This includes secure transmission of credit card/bank account information, and encrypted storage of all payment account information.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information transmitted via our Sites or Services. Any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Sites or the Services.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Sites or the Service, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. Additionally, do not leave your device unlocked so that other individuals may access your device or account. Listen360 is not in control of your wireless connection or the devices you use to log into the Services, so you should make sure you trust the devices and connections you use to access the Services.

If you believe that you have experienced unauthorized access or use of your account, please contact us immediately at privacy@listen360.com

  11. **CHOICES AND OPT-OUTS**



You may opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by following the opt-out instructions we include in such communications. Any communications from us that are not Service-related or transactional in nature will offer you an “unsubscribe” option so that you can opt out of receiving such messages.

To the extent required by law, you may choose to opt out of sharing with any other parties with whom we may share your personal information; however, you may be unable to use the Services or certain features if you wish to limit such sharing.

  * Clients and Client Users may access and modify Personal Information and other account information using the account settings page. You may also access, change and modify information previously provided or collected by sending an email to Listen360 at privacy@listen360.com to initiate changes or modifications or to obtain a file for review.

  * Respondents and other consumers who do business with Clients utilizing Listen360 Services can request that the Client provide you with access to the Personal Information Listen360 stores on its behalf, that it make changes to that Personal Information, and/or that the Personal Information be deleted from Listen360 systems. Listen360 cannot honor such requests directly from Respondents and other consumers, but will assist Clients with honoring them in a timely manner.


  * If you are a patient, customer, or otherwise do business with a Covered Entity that utilizes Listen360 systems to obtain and store your Personal Information or to obtain and store feedback from you, you can request that the Covered Entity provide you with access to the Personal Health Information (PHI/ePHI) stored in Listen360 systems on its behalf, that it make changes to that ePHI, and/or that the ePHI be deleted from Listen360 systems.

Note that use of the system delete function by a Client to remove any data related to Respondents or potential Respondents (such deleting a record or deleting feedback comments), or to remove any personal data about your company or its authorized Client Users, only restricts viewing that data from any system interface and prevents utilizing that data for any system function. It does not permanently delete the data from Listen360 systems. To have any personal data permanently deleted from Listen360 systems, you must make an official request in writing, to the address provided below or by emailing _privacy@listen360.com_ that includes the specific information that you would like permanently deleted from Listen360 systems.

This section only applies to users of our Service that are located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom and/or Switzerland (collectively, the “Designated Countries”) at the time of data collection.

We may ask you to identify which country you are located in when you use some of the Services, or we may rely on your IP address to identify which country you are located in.

  1. **Our Relationship to You.** Listen360 is a data controller with regard to any personal information directly collected from Visitors, Clients, or Client Users of its Sites and Services. A “data controller” is an entity that determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal information is processed. Any third parties that handle your personal information in accordance with our instructions are our service providers and are “data processors.” 

Listen360 acts as a service provider to Clients and is a “data processor” with regard to any consumer Personal Information imported by Clients or Client Users into our systems via our Services—whether that consumer Personal Information is entered directly into our systems by the consumer as a Respondent, entered or imported by an authorized Client User, or imported by an authorized Client third party integration. As a “data processor” Listen360 does not have any direct control over the purposes for which and the manner in which any Respondent or potential Respondent personal information is processed; instead processing of this Personal Information is governed by data processing agreements between Listen360 and our Clients.
