**Listingbook Privacy Policy**

User privacy is of utmost concern to us at **Listingbook.com** , and as such, we've laid out the following policies governing your use of this site: 

  * Our Privacy Pledge: **Listingbook.com will not willfully disclose individually identifiable information about you to any party.** However, profile data may be used for analyzing overall site demographics, user preferences and tastes, and similar "getting to know our users" purposes. We may disclose this data to third parties (such as summary reports for our sponsors and advertisers), but never with user data or identification assigned to the information provided.
  * We catalog traffic patterns throughout the Web site, including identifying browser and system data. We gather this data to optimize site conditions for our users. This data, with no personal information, may also be provided to sponsors, advertisers and potential sponsors and advertisers so they may better evaluate their advertising options. 
  * We will send you e-mail providing you with information we think will be useful to you. **Under no circumstances will we provide your e-mail address to any third parties including our sponsors and advertisers.**
  * Security: We ensure the confidentiality and security of information stored in your profile by taking all reasonable and prudent steps necessary to protect your personal information. While no security measure is foolproof, we believe that we have implemented a system that is as safe as today’s technology permits. Since we realize the importance of protecting your privacy, we will continue to evaluate new technologies and make improvements as these technologies become feasible. The user code and password you were assigned are designed to prevent someone from seeing your information by pretending to be you.
  * Online Payment: For your security, privacy, and peace of mind, all of your sensitive personal information including: credit card number, name, and address are transmitted and encrypted via a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection. SSL is the industry standard for online commerce and among the best secure online transaction methods. **Under no circumstances will Listingbook.com disclose your credit card number to third parties or employees.** Listingbook.com does not retain your credit card number.
  * Agent Messaging: Listingbook provides the ability to exchange instant messages with agents who are members of your MLS. To ensure freedom from unsolicited messages, a setting in your profile can be set to restrict agent messages to agents in your Address Book.

If at any time you feel that Listingbook has not adhered to this policy, please notify us by e-mail at [helpdesk@listingbook.com](mailto:helpdesk@listingbook.com) and we will make all reasonable efforts to promptly determine and correct the problem.
