**Light Reading, Inc.** ("Light Reading") is committed to your privacy. We created this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to inform you of our information gathering and dissemination practices for [www.lightreading.com](http://www.lightreading.com/), [www.byteandswitch.com](http://www.byteandswitch.com/), [www.unstrung.com](http://www.unstrung.com/), and [www.boardwatch.com](http://www.boardwatch.com/) (collectively known as the "Site"). You can generally visit our Sites without revealing any personal information about yourself. However, when you engage in certain activities on the Sites, such as registering to subscribe to one of the Light Reading newsletters or to participate on the message boards, we may ask you to provide certain information that is personally identifiable.

**Acquisition of Information**  
Light Reading collects information from you in the following ways: 

  * **User supplied information:** Our registration process requires your e-mail address, and a username and password of your choosing. In addition, our registration process allows you to provide the following information at your option: personal name, title, address, phone number, your business type, your estimated revenue, the technologies you are interested in, and what parts of the network you find interesting. From time to time, we may request additional information. 
  * **Cookies:** Our Sites uses "cookies," small files that are sent to your browser and stored on your hard drive. A cookie does not contain any personally identifiable information, but it does enable Light Reading to record how and when you use the Site. 
  * **Advertising:** Light Reading uses both internal and external advertising systems to display ads on the Sites. The external advertising systems are solely controlled by our advertising partners and may contain cookies or other information gathering abilities. Light Reading has no access to or control of any information obtained by these advertisers. 

**Use of Information**  
We may use any personally identifiable information you provide at your option only to: 

  * Predict and respond to your needs by aggregating our users’ information and tracking user trends. Although we do share this aggregated information with other users and third parties, it will not personally identify you.  

  * Provide you with information about Light Reading’s products, services, news and events that we believe may be of interest to you. In addition, we may provide this information to third parties who wish to inform you about their products, services, news and events that they believe may be of interest to you. While we may tell you about these other parties, it is entirely your choice whether or not to contact them. We will not share your personally identifiable information with other parties without your prior consent. If you choose to contact any third party, your communication with them will be governed by their privacy policies and not Light Reading’s. At any time, you may opt out of receiving information about Light Reading or other parties by changing your registration profile. 



**Transfer**  
Light Reading may disclose your personally identifiable information upon a transfer or sale to another entity of all or substantially all of Light Reading’s assets or stock in Light Reading’s line of business to which this Privacy Policy relates or upon any other corporate reorganization.

**Exclusion**  
Because Light Reading cannot predict, control or be responsible for information you choose to tell us or others in a publicly available fashion, this Privacy Policy does not apply to any information that you voluntarily disclose to Light Reading, our partners, our customers or any other third party via chat rooms, bulletin boards or otherwise where Light Reading did not expressly ask you for such information.

**Access by Our Employees**  
Light Reading uses good faith efforts to limit our employees’ access to your personally identifiable information to the amount reasonably required to provide prompt, high quality service.

**Update Your Profile**  
Please help us to provide you with the highest quality and most efficient service by ensuring that your registration profile is current and complete. To edit your profile, visit our [User Preferences](https://web.archive.org/web/20040610170608id_/http%3A//www.lightreading.com/register/user_lists.asp) page.

Due to the Internet’s rapidly evolving nature, Light Reading may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, Light Reading will post its updated policy at [www.lightreading.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20040610170608id_/http%3A//www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=4503). Light Reading encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.

**Questions?**  
If you have any questions or suggestions about our privacy or security policies, please feel free to contact us at [support@lightreading.com](mailto:support@lightreading.com).
