__**Cookies**__

LLS or its vendors may use cookies, web beacons, tags, log-inlogin files or other similar data collection or tracking techniques to facilitate use of our Sites by our users, and to enrich your online experience with us.  A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about that user. LLS uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie is simply terminateserased. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.

Persistent cookies are used to store the user's registration identification information from their basic registration and to facilitate their logging in to their personalized view of the Sites. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our Sites.

Session cookies remember what chapter you are registered intoin or visiting online and who you are if you go from one LLS website to another in a session. This way we are able to cut down on the number of logins required when you visit various LLS websites during any given session.

Many consider the use of cookies and such identifiers to be an industry standard measure.  Consequently, your web browser is likely set to accept cookies or allow other identifiers.  If you would prefer not to receive cookies or allow identifiers, you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies or surf anonymously.  If you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, and all the informational resources provided through them. Your registration-based personalization options and the capacity of your browser to keep track of what chapter you are visiting online as you go from one of our sites to another, is lost if you reject cookies.

LLS uses a tracking utility provided by a third party vendor to track usage of specific web pages and other resources provided through our website. The vendor sets cookies as a method for compiling site usage information but these cookies are only used to compile demographic models of site usage and are not tied to the user's personal information.

__**Digital Advertising**__

LLS allows third parties to place cookies through our websitewebsites to collect information about your visit to our and other websites in order to offer you more relevant advertising across the Internet.  This practice is known as online behavioral advertising.  These cookies (placed by our third party vendors) contain no personally identifiable information, but they may contain demographic or interest-based information in de-identified form.  This information may also be linked to Personal Information (in hashed or encrypted form) that you have voluntarily submitted to LLS, such as your email address.  If you would like to opt out of the placement of these third party cookies, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices.  If you would like to opt out of third party use of your mobile device identifier for behavioral advertising, please see www.aboutads.info/appchoices.   Please note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.  LLS does not host any form of advertising from our websites or email communications.

__**Third Party Intermediaries**__

LLS uses various third party transaction services to process online donations and provides the option of receiving certain of its online booklets, brochures, and fact sheets by mail through request forms on our websitesSites. These materials are shipped by the US Postal Service. Additional services for Light The Night Incentives,® incentives and ordering from the LLS Storefront also utilize third party vendors for ordering, fulfillment and customer service.

We will only provide these companies the information they need to deliver the service and prohibit them from using that information for any other purpose. These companies or organizations do not share or use Personal Information that may be obtained from these transactions for any secondary purposes.

LLS may need to share Personal Information with third parties in other limited circumstances. For example, we may release Personal Information to third parties to perform services on our behalf such as: advising you of our upcoming events, products, partnership offers, volunteer opportunities, and health-related information or processing credit card payments. LLS may also make your name and postal address available to other nonprofit organizations whose services or activities may be of interest to you. However, third parties retained by LLS to provide such services are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of this information and are not authorized to use this information for any purpose other than providing those services.

__**Our Commitment to Children's Privacy**__

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information on our website from those we actually know are under the age of 13.

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) protects the Personal Information of children under the age of 13. This applies to individually identifiable Personal Information about a child that is collected online, such as full name, home address, email address, telephone number or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact the child. The Act and the COPPA Rule also cover other types of information--for example, hobbies, interests and information collected through cookies or other types of tracking mechanisms--when they are tied to individually identifiable information. It is important for you to understand this law; we encourage you to read more about COPPA.

__**Note to Parents on Our Privacy Policy**__

LLS is committed to providing a safe, secure, and fun online experience for children who visit our Sites. We are dedicated to safeguarding any Personal Information collected online and to helping parents and children have positive experiences on the Internet. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. A parent or guardian may revoke their consent and ask that information about their child be deleted from the site by contacting our offices via mail (see: address below) or email supportservices@lls.org. To do this or to review Personal Information collected from children, we must verify the identity of the requesting parent. When a parent or guardian revokes consent, we will stop collecting, using, or disclosing information from that child. To respect the privacy of parents, information collected and used for the sole purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing notice is not maintained in retrievable form by the site if parental consent is not obtained after a reasonable time.
