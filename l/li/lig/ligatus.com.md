We therefore recommend to frequently refer back to this Privacy Policy and read through the current up-to-date version, which is always available online under [www.ligatus.de/en/datenschutz/](http://www.ligatus.de/en/datenschutz/).

## Personal Data

Personal data means any information that can be used to collect personal or factual information about you (such as name, address, telephone number, date of birth or e-mail address). Information that cannot (directly or indirectly) be referred to you personally (or only with disproportionate efforts), for example anonymous information, is not personal data.

## Personal Information which will be collected and used

In principle, you can use our online services without providing personal information.

If you however decide to request further information via the contact forms provided on our websites or the microsites operated onbehalf of our customers, we will ask for your name and further personal information, in order to handle your personal request or provide the services desired by you from us or our customers. Please note that the exact scope of the information requested varies, depending on the campaign and services offered by the relevant customer and will be specified in the contact form of each campaign (all mandatory fields are marked with *). You can freely decide if you want to provide the the requested information or not. However, without this information we or our customer cannot offer you the desired services. 

_b) User accounts_

Certain services on our websites which are only available to paying users can only be used by registered users with a user account. During registration, we store your e-mail address. The e-mail address serves as a user name to identify your member account, and to conduct relevant correspondence with you (e.g. setting up and maintaining your user account). As part of the registration process, we also collect your first and last name, your gender, and information about your company affiliation, mailing address, and telephone, as well as information regarding your chosen means of payment, credit card, and bank account information, if applicable, in order to bill you for the services you choose to use and ensure that you receive personalized, capable service. All mandatory information required in order to register is marked accordingly. All further information is provided voluntarily; this data is used for the purposes stated, or to improve our online services.

Your password is transmitted to and stored on our servers in encrypted form, and we are unable to access and read it; in the event that you forget your password, please use the “Forgot your password?” function provided on the website to create a new, secure password.

If you delete your account in the login area under “Account Settings” (by selecting “Delete Account”), your data will be deleted. If deletion is not possible for legal reasons, access to the data in question shall instead be blocked. Please note, however, that we may be unable, in whole or in part, to continue to offer you the services offered on our websites requiring registration in the event that your data is deleted or blocked.

In the event that my consent is revoked, I shall not, or shall no longer, be able to receive the Ligatus newsletter. I have read the current privacy policy and accept it._

_d) “Double opt-in procedure”_

In order to verify your registration when setting up a user account and/or to acquire your consent when ordering the Ligatus newsletter, we use the “double opt-in procedure”. This means that we will only set up your user account or send you the Ligatus newsletter once you have confirmed your registration via a confirmation e-mail sent to you for this purpose, by clicking on the link contained therein. By doing this, we wish to ensure that only you yourself as the owner of the e-mail address given are able to make use of our services.

## How we use your personal data

Personal data is further processed for billing and promotional purposes by us or by our partners (e.g. premiums orders). The usage of your personal data varies, depending on the relevant campaign and customer. You will be informed thoroughly about any usage of your personal data on the relevant website or within the relevant campaign.

In addition, any further processing and usage of your personal data for other purposes only takes place after your explicit consent. Without your explicit consent, your data will not be used e.g. for marketing purposes. You will only receive advertising if you have given your explicit consent. You can revoke your consent any time by using [our contact form](http://www.ligatus.de/de/ueber-ligatus/kontakt/kontaktformular.html) or sending an email to info@ligatus.com. In this case, we however may no longer be able to provide the requested or offered services to you. 

Apart from personal data provided by you via our contact forms or microsites operated on behalf of our customers or business partners, which will strictly be used to provide the relevant services to you, our web servers log general information on the usage of our websites (such asdate and time, visited websites - e.g. when each page was viewed or which page was visited most frequently).

Such log data is processed for system security reasons (to prevent abuse of our webservices), to improve our websites and webservices and as well for statistical purposes (number of users and page views). However, we do not create personalized user profiles; evaluation based on personal data does not occur. 

## Behavioral Targeting

The website you are accessing uses a retargeting system provided by Ligatus GmbH, Hohenstaufenring 30-32, D-50674 Cologne, E-mail: info@ligatus.com (hereinafter "Ligatus") to optimise the quality of the advertising shown to you. The aim of this system is to show you only adverts that may be of interest to you.

Ligatus takes the protection of your personal data very seriously! Ligatus GmbH has voluntarily undertaken to comply with the market-standard OBA Framework of EDAA / IAB Europe. As a German company, the protection of your data is a priority for Ligatus. For this reason, Ligatus only uses anonymised data to improve advert quality. As a result, neither Ligatus nor the respective operator of our partner's website you are visiting may identify you in any way. You can yourself decide at any time whether you would like to continue seeing personalised banner from Ligatus.

[](http://www.eprivacyconsult.com/oba "EDAA Trust Seal awarded to Ligatus www.ligatus.com ")

By issuing this data protection declaration we want to disclose to you more transparently how retargeting works, what data is collected, how and for what purposes this is used and how you can decline or suppress the use of retargeting functions at any time

 _a) How retargeting works in detail:_

When visiting the website of one of our partners, a cookie file is stored on your computer. Cookies are small text files that contain a single character string as a means of identification. The cookie does not store your IP address or any data that allows you to be identified. The next time you visit one of our partners' websites, only the character string is read which identifies the Internet browser you are using. This allows us, for example, to identify which page you have accessed for our partner and which advert you have been shown, without this being linked to your identity. Furthermore, all of the cookies created by us are given an expiry data and automatically expire after no more than 24 months.

 **Important:** Using cookies we cannot ever collect your personal data. For example, when you enter an email address or delivery address, or any other personal data, we cannot see your input and cannot therefore process or store it. We do not know your name, address or workplace, nor do we know your gender, age, email address or any other personally identifiable information about you. Even the IP address of your computer is not stored! You can view the data stored in the cookie on your computer. Please refer to to your web browser’s help directory or your web browser’s FAQ to learn how cookies are stored and how to read their content. The information contained within the cookie is the exact data that we can see. Deleting the cookie allows you to delete all of the data stored by us. Cookie technology does not allow viruses, Trojans or other harmful programs to be placed on your computer. User data is processed exclusively in national computer centres.

 _b) How can I check whether personalised advertising from Ligatus is enabled on my computer?_

[Here](http://www.ligatus.de/de/datenschutz/datenschutz.html#cookie_status) you can check whether personalised advertising from Ligatus is enabled (“Opt-In”) or disabled (“Opt-Out”) in your computer.

 _c) How can I disable personalised advertising from Ligatus banners?_

If you do not agree to the storing of cookies by us, you can check your cookie status at any time [here](http://www.ligatus.de/de/datenschutz/datenschutz.html#cookie_status) and disable the storage of retargeting cookies by us and therefore decline personalised adverts from Ligatus.

This means that in future you will receive random advertising that is not targeted to your interests. Please note that the "opt-out" and "opt-in" functions offered are also controlled using cookies. This means that deleting all cookies on your computer means that you will have to opt-out again.

Note also that we are continuously expanding our range of products. As this will technically involve a new system, the introduction of a new opt-out may be necessary, even if you have already opted out of retargeting prior to its introduction.

 _d) Can other forms of personalised advertising be disabled in addition to Ligatus?_

The options described in this data protection declaration refer only to the custom adverts offered by Ligatus. If you wish to disable custom advertising from other providers, you can do this via their respective websites.

There is an option to change your settings collectively for various providers under preference management on “Your Online Choices”:http://www.youronlinechoices.com/de/praferenzmanagement/.

The cookies are solely used to identify your web browser in an anonymous manner to optimize the display of advertising messages on our websites or the websites of our partners, according to your presumable interests. Cookies also allow the storage of configuration data on individualized websites, where, for example, data entered into registration pages or search fields can be stored temporally and does not have to be re-entered, when your browser session was technically intererupted or aborted.

Our cookie files only contain an automatically generated ID number and a time stamp. We neither know your name, the place you live or work, nor do we know your gender, your age, your e-mail address or any other personally identifiable information about you. Also the IP address of your device will not be stored within the cookie file. You can view the data stored in the cookie on your computer. Please refer to your web browser’s help directory or your web browser’s FAQ to learn how cookies are stored and how to read their content. The information contained within the cookie is the exact data that we can see. Deleting the cookie allows you to delete all of the data stored by us. Cookie technology does not allow viruses, Trojans or other harmful programs to be placed on your computer.

You can also use our websites without the use of cookies enabled. The most browsers accept cookies automatically. You can disable the storage of cookies or set your browser to notify you before accepting the storage of cookies. Please note that users that do not accept the storage of cookies may not be able to access certain areas of our websites.

## Usage of Google Analytics and Google Remarketing

a) The Ligatus websites use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA („Google“). Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website will be transmitted and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Please note, that the application of Google Analytics within our webservices has been enhanced with the code „gat._anonymizeIp();“ to enable the anonymous logging of IP addresses (so-called “IP-masking”). Prior to the transmission your IP address will be truncated by Google within the member states of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to a Google server in the USA and is truncated there. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data collected or held by Google.

On our behalf Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide us with more services related to the website and internet use. Further Google may transmit the information to third parties, due to legal requirements or in case third parties process the information on behalf of Google.

You may disable the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note, that if you do so, you may not be able to use the full functionalities of this website. 

You can also disable the collection of the information generated by the cookie concerning your use of the websites and the processing of these data by Google, by installing the browser plug-in available for dowload via the following link: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.

As an alternative to the above mentioned browser plug-in or when using mobile devices, you can disable the collection of the information generated by the cookie by clicking the following link: Google Analytics deaktivieren

Then, an opt-out cookie will be placed, which disables the collection of your data in case of future visits of our websites.

Further information is available here:http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en or under http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/learn/privacy.html (general informationen on Google Analytics and privacy).

b) We also allow Google to place cookies on our websites for the purpose of use-based online advertising

The cookie stored on your computer by Google allows the anonymized recognition of your browser by Google and gathers information about your activities on the websites you visit (e.g. web surfing behavior, subpages of our Internet offerings visited, etc.) Use profiles are generated from this data, using a pseudonym which does not allow conclusions to be drawn about the user and therefore cannot be used to identify a specific user. The information collected by the cookie concerning your use of this website (including your IP address) is transferred to a server in the United States of America and stored there. Google then removes the last three digits of the IP address, thus ensuring that a definite attribution of the IP address is no longer possible. Under no circumstances will Google associate your IP address with other information held by Google. Google complies with the data privacy provisions of the “US Safe Harbor” agreement and is registered with the “Safe Harbor” program of the United States Department of Commerce.

This procedure, known as “Google Remarketing”, allows anonymous recognition by Google’s websites. Your browser is identified when advertising content is supplied and assigned to a particular target group. With the aid of this information, it is possible to show you advertisements that are more relevant and address your particular interests. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity for the operators of the websites, and to provide additional services related to the use of the website and the Internet. Google may also transmit this information to third parties, insofar as permitted by law or as third parties process such information on behalf of Google.

Depending on your interests, a targeted provision of advertisements relevant to you is enabled when you visit the websites of other providers.

You may object at any time to the future collection and storage of your data by Google. Call up your ad settings in Google under www.google.de/settings/ads and deactivate the display of interest-related advertisements by Google under “deactivation settings”. This will prevent Google from displaying targeted advertising for you. An “opt out” cookie is then placed which prevents future collection of your data when you visit this website. Please note that, if you delete all cookies from your computer, the deactivation cookie is deleted along with them, and must be stored again if needed.

You can find further information regarding the terms of Google’s privacy policy at http://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy.

In addition, as a general matter, you can prevent the placing of cookies by adjusting your browser settings accordingly.

## Transmission of personal data to third parties

Subject to legal requirements, we may, in some cases, be obliged to disclose your personal information to third parties. This is for example the case when the suspicion of a criminal offence or a misuse of our websites occurs. We are then obliged to disclose your data to law enforcement authorities. 

Otherwise, your information is solely stored in our databases and on our servers (or on the servers of third party providers bound to strict data protection guidelines and specifications, that process data on our behalf), unless you were explicitely informed that the information would be transmitted to other companies, like our cooperation or promotional partners, and you have explicitly agreed prior to the transfer of your data.
