<p><strong>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information collection and use <br></strong>In connection with the use of the Site and the Services, we collect certain personal and non-personal information from you.&nbsp; We use this information to fulfill your requests; improve and manage the Site and the Services; personalize your experience on the Site; contact you; offer you products and services that may be of interest to you; if you so elect, to permit other registered users of the Site to contact you as discussed in Article VI below; and in connection with the various features of the Site that may permit you to input, post or provide information.&nbsp; We collect personal and non-personal information when you voluntarily provide it to us (for example, in the course of registration) and when you visit the Site.&nbsp; The information we collect from you depends on your use of the Site.</p>
<p>Depending on how you use the Site, we may collect certain personal and non-personal information from you in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Registration:</strong>&nbsp; There are many aspects of the Site that can be enjoyed as a visitor, but you need to register in order to utilize certain features and access certain content in the Site and to take advantage of many of the Services on the Site.&nbsp; Registration is entirely optional.

<p><strong>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information disclosure to third parties <br></strong>We know how important it is to keep the personal information you've provided to us confidential.

<p>Disclosure for legal reasons: We may release personal information to third parties: (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (2) in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others, a threat to homeland security, a threat to our system or network, or cases in which we believe it is reasonably necessary to investigate or prevent harm, fraud, abuse, or illegal conduct. In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose your personal information to a third party, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court order.</p>
