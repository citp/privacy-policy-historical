<div class="Details">
    <p>
        <b>Last Updated:</b> November 3, 2008<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        This policy informs you of the policies of Salem Communications Corporation and
        its subsidiary entities (collectively, “Salem”), including without limitation
        the Salem and radio stations concerning the collection, use and disclosure of personal
        information from this Salem-related website.&nbsp; Because we may gather certain
        types of information about our users, we want to help you understand the terms and
        conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information.&nbsp; At Salem
        we understand your privacy is important to you. Even though we may need to collect
        information about you to provide you with some of our products and services, you
        may not want us to disclose that information to others.&nbsp; Accordingly, what
        follows is a description of how we gather and use information about you (collectively
        “Your Information”).    
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Please note that by visiting this website, you consent to the collection of
            Your Information by Salem as set forth in this Privacy Policy. </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1.&nbsp; Will Salem Disclose the Information It Collects to Outside Parties?</b><br>
        Generally, Salem does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.
        However, Salem may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, traffic patterns,
        and related site information to third-party vendors. Generally, these statistics
        will include no personally identifying information. However, Salem may release Your
        Information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary
        to (i) comply with the law; (ii) protect the rights, property or safety of Salem,
        our users, or others; (iii) enforce or apply the Terms of Use applicable to this
        website; or (iv) enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules.&nbsp;
        Also, we may give some or all of Your Information to third-party vendors who assist
        us in fulfilling some of the functions of this Website.&nbsp; Finally, we may provide
        Your Information to third parties if you authorize us to.</p>
    <p>
        <b>2.&nbsp; What Information Do We Collect? &nbsp;How Do We Use It?<br>
        </b><b>Registration Data</b><br>
        Registration data is voluntary information provided directly by you in order to
        receive optional access to certain services or site areas.&nbsp; This data may include
        personally identifiable information such as your name, age, email address, zip code,
        or telephone number.&nbsp; In addition, registration data may include preference
        information such as usernames, passwords, desired newsletters, etc.&nbsp; Here are
        some of the ways we might use that information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To deliver services that you request or purchase such as newsletters, offers, message
            boards, forums, and other items</li>
        <li>To help us create and deliver the content that is most relevant to you</li>
        <li>To alert you to news, events, contests, and other items if you so request</li>
        <li>To allow you entrance into restricted areas of the site, as appropriate</li>
        <li>To send you information about Salem, this website and other websites</li>
        <li>To compile statistics and conduct basic research</li>
        <li>To give to third parties, who may send you promotional material</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Surveys</b><br>
        Sometimes Salem posts optional, voluntary surveys in which we ask for personally
        identifiable information. &nbsp;The choice is yours -- you don't have to answer
        surveys, but if you do, please understand that Salem may use the information you
        provide and that we may share it with third parties.&nbsp; If we're asking for optional
        information, we may mark it with an asterisk (*) or otherwise notify you so that
        you can skip that portion if you want.&nbsp; Here are some ways we might use that
        information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To help us create and deliver the content that is most relevant to you</li>
        <li>To send you information about Salem and this Website</li>
        <li>To give to our content partners, who may send you promotional material</li>
        <li>To give to our advertisers, who may send you information about their products and
            services</li>
        <li>To share in aggregate form with our partners and advertisers </li>
        <li>To compile statistics and conduct basic research</li>
        <li>To give to third parties, who may send you promotional material</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Contests and Sweepstakes</b><br>
        From time to time Salem runs voluntary contests and sweepstakes in which we ask
        for personally identifiable information such as your name, age, email address, or
        telephone number. That's so we can determine if you're eligible for the contest
        and to let you know if you win. &nbsp;Sometimes we request additional information
        such as your gender, marital status and income level. &nbsp;Here are some of the
        ways we might use the information that we collect:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>To determine if you're eligible for the contest</li>
        <li>To notify you if you're a winner</li>
        <li>To send you information about Salem and this Website</li>
        <li>To help us create and deliver the content that is most relevant to you</li>
        <li>To give to third parties, who may send you promotional email</li>
        <li>To give to advertisers, who may send you email about their products and services</li>
        <li>To share in aggregate form with our partners and advertisers</li>
        <li>To compile statistics and conduct basic research </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Special Offers</b>
        <br>
        From time-to-time, Salem and its affiliated entities are able to provide you with
        special offers of products and services. When providing these offers, we need to
        gather personally identifiable information from you such as your name, age, email
        address and telephone number. Your acceptance of these offers is completely voluntary,
        but if you do not correctly enter the required information, you may not receive
        the product or service offered. &nbsp;Here is how we may use this information:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>To ensure proper delivery of the product or service</li>
        <li>To view statistics and conduct basic research</li>
        <li>To send you information about Salem and this Website</li>
        <li>To give to select parties on our site, who may send you promotional material</li>
        <li>To give to select radio stations, who may send you promotional material</li>
        <li>To give to third parties, who may send you promotional material</li>
        <li>To share in aggregate form with our partners and advertisers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Online Commerce Services</b><br>
        This website may offer shopping and other online commerce services, which may be
        offered by Salem or by a firm that operates a store under contract with us. If our
        website offers such services, you will use a customer order form to request information,
        products, and services. The order form will ask you to give us contact information
        (like name or email address), financial information (like account or credit card
        numbers), and demographic information (like zip code or age).</p>
    <p>
        We will use the financial information that you provide to bill you for products
        and services. By giving our site your credit card and related personal information,
        you are authorizing our store to give that information to the merchant and credit
        card company in order to confirm and fulfill your order.</p>
    <p>
        We will use contact information from the order form to fulfill your orders. We may
        also use contact data to get in touch with you when necessary. We will not otherwise
        use or distribute your financial information without your prior approval.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Confirmed Opt-in</b><br>
        Salem acquires no personal or registration data about our users except what you
        explicitly and voluntarily provide (i.e., opt-in).&nbsp; We reserve the right to
        use this information specifically for the purposes related to your registration
        in addition to any other purpose set forth in this Privacy Policy.<b> </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>If You Contact Us</b><br>
        We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive from you. Unless you
        tell us otherwise, we will not use your address for any other purpose.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Feedback Data</b><br>
        Feedback data is voluntary information (such as success stories) provided directly
        by you for the purposes of assessing the products or services provided through Salem
        Web Network sites. &nbsp;There are areas on Salem Web Network owned sites which
        allow you to submit feedback. Any feedback you submit in these areas becomes the
        property of Salem Web Network, and we reserve the right to use this information
        for the purposes of marketing, quality control, or to contact you for further information.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Usage (Log) Data</b>
        <br>
        Salem also gathers and analyzes Usage or Log Data including your IP (internet protocol)
        address assigned by your ISP (internet service provider), and the type of operating
        system you are using on your computer, and the type of web browser&nbsp; you are
        using to view our Website.&nbsp; Salem management uses Usage or Log Data to help
        diagnose problems with and optimize performance of the server.&nbsp; This information
        also allows us to evaluate user traffic patters into, out from, and within our Website.&nbsp;
        These uses, however, do not allow us to connect your IP address with your personal
        identity.</p>
    <p>
        <b>What About "Cookies"?</b><br>
        "Cookies" are small pieces of information that your Web browser stores
        on your computer's hard drive.&nbsp; From time to time our Website may place cookies
        on your computer’s hard drive that enable our systems to recognize your browser
        and to provide you with certain features.&nbsp; Use of cookies also provides information
        about your Web usage, which helps us compile demographic and statistical information
        about visitors who are utilizing our Website. Our cookies may contain personally
        identifying information. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you
        can usually change your browser to prevent that.

        <b>Public Forums</b><br>
        This site may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available
        to its users.&nbsp; Any information you disclose in these areas becomes public information
        and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.&nbsp;
        We cannot safeguard the privacy of any such information you choose to disclose online

        <b>Sale of Our Company</b> Salem may include any information we collect
        through this website in our customer information database.&nbsp; This database is
        considered an asset owned by Salem. As in any business venture, the sale of Salem
        is always a possibility, either as an entire corporate entity or through an asset
        sale that may include our customer information database.&nbsp; Should another entity
        ever purchase or acquire Salem or its assets, all information contained in our customer
        information database will be considered a transferred asset and become the property
        of the purchasing or acquiring entity.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Links to Other Sites</b><br>
        When you visit Salem, you may be linked to other outside sites. &nbsp;This includes
        links to sites operated by advertisers, sponsors, and partners that may use Salem's
        logo as part of an agreement with Salem. &nbsp;These other sites may send their
        own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. &nbsp;These
        other sites may be developed by people over whom Salem exercises no control and,
        as such, are not subject to the Salem Privacy Policy. Salem is not responsible for
        the privacy policies of these other sites, nor for the use of any information that
        these sites may collect.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Information Sharing With Third Parties</b><br>
        From time to time we may enter into a special relationship with another company
        that is not owned by Salem to provide additional features at this website. These
        special relationships may include “powered by” partners, business partners,
        sponsors, and co-branded sites (referred to here as “co-branded pages”).
        You should look for a specific privacy statement on any such co-branded page. Any
        personal information that you provide when signing up at one of those co-branded
        pages may be shared with our third party partner. You should also check our partner’s
        website for information regarding its privacy policies.</p>
    <p>
        Also, the nature of some features of our site may require that we share personal
        information about you with persons or companies outside of the Salem corporate enterprise.
        For example, this may occur at a feature that enables you, via our site, to ask
        questions of persons or entities that are not part of the Salem enterprise. By responding
        to those features of the site, whether by email or direct entry of information on
        our website, you are consenting to our transferring that information to such persons
        or entities.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Children's Privacy</b><br>
        Because the safety of children is very important to us, Salem will not knowingly
        accept personal information from children under the age of 13 without first obtaining
        written parental consent.&nbsp; A parent can give such consent by filling out and
        signing the
        <a href="http://www.lightsource.com/account/parental-consent.html">
        Salem Parental Consent Form</a> and returning it to us at the contact point
        listed below.&nbsp; If a parent wishes to refuse to permit collection or use of
        their child's information by Salem, that parent should contact us to request deletion
        of their child's account.</p>
    <p>
        If you have any questions or comments regarding children’s privacy at Salem
        or if you would like to submit a signed Parental Consent Form, please contact:</p>

        <b>Information Security</b><br>
        The security and confidentially of Your Information is extremely important to us.
        Accordingly, we take appropriate security measures to protect against the unauthorized
        access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data. This includes the use of
        encryption technology to ensure that Your Information is protected. Please understand,
        however, that despite our best efforts no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Your California Privacy Rights<br>
        </b>Beginning on January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits
        customers of Salem who are California residents to request certain information regarding
        our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing

        any lost profits, indirect, special, or consequential damages. Any such third party
        licensors have exclusive proprietary rights from the information received via the

        <b>General Information</b><br>
        This Policy and the Terms of Use for this website shall be governed by, construed
        and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Virginia, as it is applied
        to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within such state, without
        regard to conflict of law principles. You agree that any cause of action you or
        Salem brings to enforce this Policy and/or the Terms of Use, or in connection with
        any matters related to this Salem website and/or the Privacy Policy, shall be brought
        only in either the state or Federal courts located in Richmond, Virginia. You agree
        to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Virginia for
        any cause of action arising out of this Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        If any provision of this Policy, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances,
        is held invalid or for any reason, unenforceable including, but not limited to,
        the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, then such provision shall be
        deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that matches, as closely as
        possible, the original provision, and the other provisions of this Policy shall
        remain in full force and effect. The failure of either party to insist upon strict
        performance of any provision of this Policy shall not be construed as a waiver of
        any provision or right. Unless expressly provided otherwise, this Policy and the
        Terms of Use for this website are the entire agreement between you and Salem with
        respect to the use of this Salem website and shall not be modified except in writing,
