PRIVACY POLICY
Lightning Source Inc. ("LSI") will collect certain information from you while using websites controlled or owned by LSI including
Personally Identifiable Information to help customize content supplied to you and provide information as may be needed for your use
of the selected Products. Information about you is important to us and we agree not to sell or share this information except to Third
Party Service Providers or LSI affiliated companies who are either subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as
protective as those described in this Privacy Policy. Third-Party Service Providers perform functions on our behalf and may include
analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to
personal information needed to perform their functions and may not use it for other purposes. The following Privacy Policy will help
you understand how LSI collects, uses, and safeguards the personal information you provide on any Products offered and is part of
and subject to the LSI Terms and Conditions.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU AND HOW IT IS USED
Our registration and user forms require users to provide us with information, including names and e-mail addresses. The forms allow
you to request additional information or order our Products or additional material as may be available from LSI. This information
falls into two categories: Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”)
(collectively “Information”). PII includes information that identifies you specifically, such as your name, address, email address,
phone number, other contact information, employer, business name, social security number and credit card numbers. Non-PII is
anonymous data that does not identify you specifically, such as aggregate data about the number of people who have accessed a
particular Product. We may collect, use, transfer and disclose Non-PII for any purpose. You can choose not to provide PII we may
request of you, but, in general, most of the PII we request is required in order to provide our service and the lack of such PII will
prevent us from doing so.
When you browse any LSI website, you do not do so anonymously. Other information to be collected and logged includes: browser
type, browser language, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address and domain, date and time of your request, and the device
you are using. This aggregate information is used to properly administer our Products, make updates to our website, and analyze how
our site is being used.
In addition, LSI may collect Information about you when you visit the LSI website through the use of “cookies.” Cookies are small
text files placed in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences. Cookies themselves do not contain any PII but may be used
by LSI in conjunction with your PII. All computers have the ability to decline cookies. This can be done by activating the setting on
your browser that enables you to decline the cookies. Please note that if you choose to decline cookies, you may be unable to access
parts of the website.
LSI’s Use Of Your Information. LSI uses your Information by itself or in conjunction with data collected through other sources to
meet our contractual commitments to you, to provide the Products to you, to respond to your requests, to properly administer and
maintain the Products, to customize content supplied to you, to provide you with information related to the Products, to update the
website and analyze how it is used, to offer you the Product, to improve the Products, to prevent fraud, violation of intellectual
property rights and unauthorized use of Products or your account, to track your purchase history, to conduct research, to contact you,
to inform you about certain changes to our Products, to develop new Products, or as otherwise appropriate to the business needs of LSI
related to the Products. If you no longer use the Products, LSI may retain any Information that you have provided and may continue
to use it for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
Content Owners. LSI may share Information about you and your use of the Products with content owners or licensees that have rights
related to the Products that you access (“Content Owners”). Content Owners will use this Information for their own research and
tracking purposes, to evaluate Product use and access, to improve Products and related analysis. LSI will not reveal your PII to
Content Owners, just anonymous Product usage data that does not identify you specifically.
Disclosures As Required By Law Or To Prevent Harm. LSI reserves the right to disclose Information if we reasonably believe that
access, use, preservation or disclosure of such Information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal
process, or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable terms of use, including investigation of potential violations
thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address illegal or suspected illegal activities, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against
harm to the rights, property or safety of LSI, its users, the Content Owners or the public as required or permitted by law.
CHILDRENS PRIVACY


You must be 18 years of age or older to create an account on this website. LSI does not solicit orders or collect personally identifiable
information from children under the age of thirteen. If we have reason to believe that any personally identifying information has been
submitted to us by a child under thirteen, we will delete that information as soon as possible and not disclose it to any third party or
use it ourselves in any way.
SECURITY
We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which
encrypts information you input. We use encryption to protect all information and a firewall to help protect against unlawful
intrusions. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off
when finished using a shared computer, however LSI cannot guarantee complete security, as it does not exist on the Internet.
CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
The policies described in this Privacy Policy are current as of the last updated date at the beginning of this policy. LSI reserves the
right to periodically update this Privacy Policy at its discretion. Notice of any revisions will be posted to this page and are effective
once posted. If you are concerned about how your Information is used, bookmark this page and check back periodically.
TRANSFER OF INFORMATION AND INTERNATIONAL USERS
Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process information necessarily involves the
transmission of data on an international basis. Therefore, by using LSI Products, you acknowledge and consent to the transfer of your
information outside your country of residence to any country (including the United States) where we have facilities or engage third
parties (including but not limited to payment processors, cloud service or other IT providers, and other companies that provide
services to us). You understand that the countries to which we may transfer information may not have as comprehensive a level of
data protection as in your country.

personal information and/or our use of cookies and other technologies, please contact us via email at:
