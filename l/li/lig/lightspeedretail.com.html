<p>LightSpeed Retail Inc. (also referred to as “LightSpeed”, “us” or “we”) respects the privacy of every individual who visits this Website and is committed to the protection of their personal information. “Personal Information”, as used in this Privacy Policy, means information about an identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization.</p>
<p> This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) is incorporated into and forms part of the Terms of Use, which outlines the terms, and conditions you agree to when accessing and using the Website. By accessing and using the Website, you agree and consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information (information that can be used to identify you) as outlined in this Privacy Policy</p>
 
<br>
<h3>IP Protocol (IP) Addresses</h3>
<p>When you access the Internet using your computer, your Internet service provider assigns you an IP Address. Generally, every time you connect to the Internet, your IP Address changes. In some circumstances (ie. with some broadband connections) your IP Address may not change in which case, it can be associated with your particular computer. Examples of the type of information that can be collected using your IP Address include your type of Internet Browser and the type of computer operating system you are using. LightSpeed, or its authorized agents, may use your IP Address to collect and report aggregate information on how the Website is being used and ways in which the Website can be improved.</p>
  
  &nbsp; <br>
<h3>Web Log Information</h3>
<p>Web log information is non-personal information that is collected by the computer that hosts the Website (the “Website Server”) when you visit the Website, including, but not limited to, the date and time you visited the Website, the type of Internet Browser you are using and the type of computer operating system you are using. Web log information may be collected and used by LightSpeed or its authorized agents in aggregate to assess how the Website is being used and how to improve the Website.</p>
  
  &nbsp; <br>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>This Website uses a technology called “cookies”. A cookie is a token that a server gives to your browser when you access a website on the Internet. Cookies are capable of storing many types of data. Cookies help provide additional functionality to the Website or help us analyze the Website usage more accurately. For instance, our server may set a cookie that keeps you from having to enter a password more than once during a visit to the Website. In all cases in which cookies are used, we will not collect personally identifiable information without your explicit permission. With most Internet Browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your Internet Browser’s instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.
  
You should be aware that operators of third party websites linked to the Website may also collect your personal information through the use of “cookies”. LightSpeed, its affiliates and any directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors or agents of the foregoing shall not be responsible for how such operators collect, use or disclose your personal information. You need to contact these operators directly for information on their data collection and distribution policies. Your linking to a third party website or webpage is entirely at your own risk and subject to the terms and conditions of such websites or webpages.</p>
  
  &nbsp; <br>
<h3>Contacting LightSpeed By E-mail</h3>
<p>Any communication, comments, ideas, concepts, know-how, techniques, material or other information (collectively, the “Communication”) that you voluntarily post or transmit to LightSpeed by e-mail is, and will be treated as, non-confidential and non-proprietary. By transmitting any Communication to LightSpeed by e-mail, you grant to LightSpeed and all of its affiliates, an unrestricted, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, display, modify, transmit, distribute, publish, broadcast or post your Communication for any purpose. However, we will not release your name in connection with such Communication unless: (a) you grant us permission to do so; (b) we first notify you that the Communication you submit to a particular part of the Website will be published or otherwise used with your name on it; or (c) we are required to do so by law.</p>

&nbsp;<br>
<h3>Collection of Personal Information</h3>
<p>LightSpeed only collects personal information from you when you voluntarily provide it to access or use this Website. If you refuse, are unwilling, or cannot accept the Terms of Use, which include this Privacy Policy, we may be unable to provide you with information or services from this Website.
