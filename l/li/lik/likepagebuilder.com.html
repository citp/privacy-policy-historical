                          This privacy policy tells  you how we collect, use, and protect your   personal information. By visiting our  website, you accept and agree to   the terms and conditions of this privacy  policy. In particular, you   consent to our collection and use of your personal  information as   described in this privacy policy.</p>

                          2. MINORS. <br>
                          We do not provide  services or sell products to children. If you are   below the age of 18, you may  use our website only with the permission   and active involvement of a parent or  legal guardian.

                          Like most places on the  Internet, simply by visiting our website you   automatically tell us certain  information. This includes basic   information such as your IP address, when you  visited, the website from   where you came prior to visiting us, the website  where you go when you   leave our website, your computer's operating system, and  the type of   web browser that you are using. Our website automatically records  this   basic information about you.<br>
                          And like many other  websites, we may use cookies. In plain English,   this means information that our  website's server transfers to your   computer. This information can be used to  track your session on our   website. Cookies may also be used to customize our  website content for   you as an individual. If you are using one of the common  Internet web   browsers, you can set up your browser to either let you know when  you   receive a cookie or to deny cookie access to your computer.<br>
                          We may also collect any  data that you provide us by posting it at our   website or by e-mail. You can  always choose not to provide us with   information. However, if you do withhold  information, we may deny you   access to some or all of our website's services  and features.<br>
                          Some transactions between  you and our website may involve payment by   credit card, debit card, checks,  money orders, and/or third party   online payment services. In such transactions,  we will collect   information related to the transaction as part of the course of  doing   business with you, including your billing address, telephone number, and    other information related to the transaction.   All credit card details submitted are encrypted using "Secure Socket   Layer" (SSL)   encryption. We use your credit card information to process   your order only and do not store your credit card information on our   servers.</p>
                        <p><br>
                          5. WHAT WE DO  WITH YOUR INFORMATION.<br>
                          We use your information  to operate our website's business activities.   For example, we may use this data  to contact you about changes to our   website, new services, or special offers, resolve disputes, troubleshoot   issues, and enforce our  website's terms and conditions.<br>
                          As a general rule, we  will not give your data to third parties   without your permission. However,  there are some important exceptions   to this rule that are described in the  following paragraphs.<br>
                          We may, in  our sole discretion, provide information about you to law   enforcement or other  government officials for purposes of fraud   investigations, alleged intellectual  property infringement, or any   other suspected illegal activity or matters that  may expose us to legal   liability.<br>
                          Although we  do not disclose individually identifiable information, we   may disclose  aggregate data about our website's visitors to   advertisers or other third  parties for marketing and promotional   purposes. <br>
                          From time to  time, we may use third party suppliers to provide   services on our website. If a  supplier wants to collect information   about you, you will be notified. However,  you will never be required to   give information to a third party supplier. We  restrict the way third   party suppliers can use your information. They are not  allowed to sell   or give your information to others.</p>

                          If you obtain personally  identifiable information about another   website user, you are not allowed to  disclose this information to   anyone else without the consent of the user and  our consent too.<br>
                          We hate junk e-mail (Spam).
