# Privacy Policy

Like.com is committed to providing you a positive experience during your visit to our Web site, while respecting and working to protect your online privacy. We have adopted this policy to safeguard your personal information and protect its confidentiality. We seek to limit the collection and use of personal information to what is necessary to administer our business and Web site, provide you with the highest quality visit and offer you information we think will be of interest. We will use our best efforts not to disclose any individual information to other organizations.

Like.com gathers personal information from our visitors on a voluntary basis only. Personal information is typically an email address, but may include name, title, company, address, phone number, etc. The individual information we collect is used only to facilitate the online experience through enhanced navigation or to suggest areas in which we may improve the structure and content of the site. Unless given explicit permission by users, we do not sell, rent or transmit personal information to other organizations.

All personal information you provide to Like.com is secured on our server with restricted access. We reserve the right to use agents, who are bound by strict confidentiality guidelines, to perform storage and processing functions. Only designated employees or agents who need to carry out legitimate business functions are permitted to view your personal data. Employees or agents who violate this privacy policy are subject to disciplinary actions, up to and including termination.

Because Like.com considers the individual information we maintain to be confidential, our policy is to disclose no personal information to third parties unless release is required by law or is pertinent to judicial or government investigations or proceedings. While Like.com uses its best efforts and current technology to implement this Privacy Policy, it cannot, of course, guarantee that information it seeks to protect will be protected under all circumstances, including those beyond its reasonable control.

Our site may contain links to other sites. We will make every effort to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy. However, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by organizations sponsoring these other sites.

We reserve the right to change this policy at any time by notifying visitors of the existence of the new privacy policy.
