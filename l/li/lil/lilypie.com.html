      Lilypie.com allows you to set up a Wishlist, receive newsletters, and use the Lilypie Baby ticker. 
	  We use the information that we collect about you to create a more personalized online
        experience. This is just a brief overview, so please read on for more
        details about our Privacy Policy. This Policy may change from time to
        time, so please check back periodically.<br>
        <br>
      Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only
      addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you online.
      We encourage you to ask questions and to be very cautious before you disclose
      your personal information to others.<br>
      <br>
     Please <a href="/contact.php">contact us</a>  if you have any questions.</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy will explain the following regarding use of our
      site: </p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>What information does Lilypie.com collect from you?</b><br>
          Lilypie.com collects two types of information about its visitors: Personally
            Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
            Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you
            with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our
            site. <br><br>
              <b>Personally Identifiable Information</b><br>
          This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you
          are. Personal information is requested when you register a Wishlist, and send us feedback. 
		  For example, this information might include your name, and e-mail address. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b><br>
          This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific
          individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where
          you visit our site in several ways. This information is compiled
          and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. For example,
          this information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL")
          that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are
          using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is
          the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide
          Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission
          Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such
          as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol
          to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In
          other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned
          to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to
          locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in
          order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.<br>
        <br>
        <a href="#top">TOP</a>
        </li><li><b>Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?</b><br>
          Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide Lilypie.com's
            visitors with requested services.<br>
            <br>
          We review the actions of the Lilypie.com visitors on an aggregate basis to determine customers'
          preferences. Lilypie.com also does research on our visitors' demographics,
          interests, and pages viewed based on the information provided to us
          from our server log files and the HTTP headers. We receive reports from our ad server, third party
          ad servers, content servers, or a web site analysis agent that tells
          us how many ads were presented and clicked upon or what content was
          served or viewed. <br>
          <br>
          We gather information in the following ways: <br>
          <br>
          <b>Wishlist</b><br>
          If you decide to create a Wishlist through our site, you will create
          an account, where we will collect and use your name, e-mail address and password.

		  Access to your Wishlist is protected by an encrypted key which you send out to people
		  who you wish to visit and comment on your Wishlist. Personal information about your
		  guests are not stored by Lilypie.com<br><br>
          <b>Newsletter</b><br>

          to let you know what is new on the site. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Contact Information </b><br>
          If you contact Lilypie.com through the contact page, by e-mail or letter, we may keep a record of your correspondence
          or comments. If you report a problem with our site, we may collect
          such information in a file specific to you. If you contact us through
          our feedback area to send you a reply. <br>
          <br>
