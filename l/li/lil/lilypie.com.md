# Lilypie - Privacy Policy

**OVERVIEW**

In this Privacy Policy, "us", "we" or "our" means Lilypie.com (ABN 72 866 880 115). Lilypie.com allows you to receive newsletters, send feedback and use the Lilypie tickers. We use the information that we collect about you to create a more personalized online experience. This is just a brief overview, so please read on for more details about our Privacy Policy. This Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically. 

Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you online. We encourage you to ask questions and to be very cautious before you disclose your personal information to others. 

Please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact.php) if you have any questions. 

This Privacy Policy will explain the following regarding use of our site: 

  1. **What information does Lilypie.com collect from you?**

Lilypie.com collects two types of information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site. 

**Personally Identifiable Information**

This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. Personal information is requested when you register a Lilypie account, or send us feedback. For example, this information might include your name, and e-mail address. 

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit our site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. For example, this information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.
