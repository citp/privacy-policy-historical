THE KIND OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT

When you purchase from Lillian Vernon Online, order a catalog or register to be a preferred customer, we only collect the information that you provide us: name, address, email, credit card and any other data we need to complete your order or request and ensure that any marketing communications are tailored to your particular interests and lifestyle. Registration is optional, so you choose whether or not we store your information to make future shopping experiences more convenient.

When you order from the catalog or our online store, your name becomes part of our customer database. From time-to-time we may share our mailing lists with carefully screened companies. If you would not like to have your name and address shared with these companies, please go to page 2 of [Update My Profile/Edit Preferences](https://www.lillianvernon.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/LogonForm?langId=-1&storeId=10001&catalogId=10001) and UNCHECK the box that gives us permission to share your mailing address.

**When You Visit the Site...**
