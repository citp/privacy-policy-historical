## Our Use Of Cookies

We regularly use browser tracking cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a website. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a website or web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.

We use cookies but do not store personal information in your cookie. We use cookies in order to improve your shopping experience. For example, we use cookies to:

  * Recognize you when you return to our website
  * Keep track of your order as you shop on our website and remember what items are in your My Tote
  * Process your order on our website and enable you to use Express Checkout, if you have created an account at LillyPulitzer.com
  * Study how our Guests navigate through our website and which products they request in site searches
  * Customize the message and delivery of online banner ads based on your online behavior.



Through our use of cookies, we may also track and maintain the identity of the website you visited immediately prior to visiting our website. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other websites.

 

Cookies are also used to review how visitors to our website navigate our site or interact with our email advertising. Third-party companies assist in the collection and analysis of this data. Your name, street address or credit card number is not accessed by or shared with other companies.

 

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you decide to block cookies, our website might not function correctly. For example, if you do not allow cookies at all, you might not be able to view some of our website or use certain features like adding products to your shopping cart, which may impact your shopping experience with us. If you refuse cookies and wish to place an order from our website, please call Guest Services at [1.888.725.4559](tel:18887254559).

 

We work with a variety of advertising companies to place our ads on websites across the Internet. These advertising companies collect anonymous information about your visits to our web site, other advertising websites or interaction with our email through the use of cookies. This technology allows them to develop Lilly Pulitzer advertising and marketing about goods and offers that may be of interest to you.

## Security

We do our best to provide you with a safe shopping experience. We have in place certain physical, electronic, contractual, and managerial safeguards to protect the security and privacy of your personal information.

 

When you enter your personal information on our websites, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your information as it is transmitted to us. To make sure you are accessing our secure server before you submit personal financial information, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the URL or Location line of your browser. If you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the address in that line should change from “http” to “https”.

 

If for any reason you cannot access the secure server, or if you're not quite comfortable shopping online at any of our websites, please feel free to place your order with us through Guest Services at [1.888.725.4559](tel:18887254559).

 

Identity thieves sometimes send fraudulent email messages to trick customers into divulging personal or financial information (a practice known as "phishing"). "Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an email that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal information, do not respond. We will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal information through email. If you have received or entered personal information in response to a suspicious email, pop-up or phony website claiming to be affiliated with Lilly Pulitzer, please call us at [1.888.725.4559](tel:18887254559) immediately.

## Children's Privacy

Protecting children's privacy is important to us. Our website is a general audience site. We do not collect or maintain information from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is targeted to attract anyone under 13. We also do not send email correspondence to anyone who tells us that they are under the age of 13 without their parent's consent. Children under the age of 13 should always ask their parents or guardians for permission before providing any personal information to anyone online. We urge parents and guardians to participate in their children's online activities and use parental control or other web filtering technology to supervise children's access to the web.

## Mobile Location Analytics Data

We may use tracking technology to collect certain information about your Wi-Fi enabled mobile device, including the presence of the device in our stores, its signal strength, its manufacturer, and a unique identifier known as its Media Access Control (“MAC”) address (collectively, “Customer Mobile Device Data”). This Customer Mobile Device Data may be collected for the purpose of determining the amount, location and frequency of customer traffic into our stores. A mobile device’s MAC address identifies a specific device to the surrounding Wi-Fi networks. The MAC address does not disclose the identity or any other personal data of the mobile device user. You may opt-out of having your MAC address recorded by visiting the following link and entering your mobile device’s MAC address: [https://optout.smart-places.org](https://optout.smart-places.org/). To learn more about the use of Customer Mobile Device Data and your choices, please visit: [http://smart-places.org](http://smart-places.org/).

## Use Of Our Wi-Fi Network

Our service providers(s) may use your information to help them understand how groups of people behave, to help them and/or us provide you with a customized shopping experience, and to provide advertising of their or other third party products or services. In particular, our service provider(s) collects information that is broadcast by Wi-Fi enabled devices as well as other data from devices (e.g., web viewing and application use data, device type, device identifier, IP address (we call this other data ‘Activity Information”): (a) to create aggregated reports for their retail partners (like us) to help improve store operations and other business purposes; and (b) to allow them and/or retailers (like us) to engage directly with their visitors through Wi-Fi. Upon registration, our service provider(s) may combine information that you provide upon registration with data that they previously collected while providing services to us (dating back to July 19, 2016). Our service provider(s) collect Activity Information online and in mobile apps over time and across devices to deliver advertisements our service provider(s) think are relevant to you online, in mobile apps, and across various devices associated with you.
