Note: Please see Section II below for a description of certain specific policies applicable to the collection and use of information from children under the age of 13.

EMI Music Limited ("EMI") respects the privacy concerns of the visitors to this Web site. As a general policy, no personal information is automatically collected from users of the site. In the event that we do collect any personally identifiable data about visitors to this site, that information is only collected on a voluntary basis, and it is only known to EMI [and, with respect to certain information, the relevant artist and their management]. 

Certain non-personal information of visitors (for example, the type of browser being used by the visitor, the type of operating system in use by the visitor and the domain name of the visitor's Internet service provider) is recorded by the standard operation of EMI's Internet servers. This information is primarily used for internal purposes, and only in an aggregate and non-personally-identifying form. However, EMI Music sometimes does provide this information, in aggregate and non-personally identifying form, to other parties for marketing, advertising or other use.

Personally identifiable information may be collected by EMI when Web Site visitors voluntarily provide this information (including when visitors fill out contest entry forms, subscribe to newsletters/artist information bulletins or participate in other types of promotions). All such personal information is retained by EMI and is not sold or otherwise transferred outside the company unless we obtain the user's express consent to do so or if we are required by law or by court/governmental order to disclose such information in a particular circumstance. This information is used by EMI for internal marketing and promotional purposes, in order to better understand the use of our sites and to support promotions included on these sites, as well as to enhance user enjoyment during the on-line experience. This data, in aggregate, non-personally-identifying form, may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising or other uses. We sometimes also use e-mail addresses and other personally identifying information to contact visitors who communicate with us. For example, we direct e-mail to visitors who provide us with their e-mail addresses for specific purposes such as receiving our e-mail newsletters/bulletins or being notified if they have won one of our contests. Each e-mail newsletter or bulletin contains instructions on how to discontinue receipt of the newsletter or bulletin.

This site also uses "cookies," which are pieces of information that are transferred to an individual user's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. EMI never uses cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie and the cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information. Cookies function by saving your passwords and site preferences - and as a result, it is possible to speed up your future activities at our site and allow us to provide you information specifically tailored to your interests. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you would prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it may be possible that some parts of the site will not function optimally if you do so. 

This site contains links to other Web sites. EMI is not responsible for the privacy policies and practices or the content of such Web sites.

II. Specific Policies Regarding Children Under the Age of 13

EMI encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on this site. Parents should consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers to help supervise their children's online activities. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing their name, address, and other personal information online without parental permission. 

Activities on this site are carried out in compliance with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. In accordance with the requirements of that Act, no personal information (including name, mailing address, telephone number and email address) will be collected from any visitor under the age of 13 without first obtaining verifiable consent from the parent or legal guardian of such child. Accordingly, no information should be submitted to or posted at this site by visitors under the age of 13 without the consent of their parent or legal guardian. Parents or legal guardians may provide EMI with consent to collect such information by e-mail, by facsimile or by postal mail at the number/addresses set forth below under "Contact Us."

Parents and legal guardians may request to review information collected from their children under the age of 13, may ask to have that information deleted, and may refuse to allow further collection or use of any child's information. To request such review or to give instructions regarding information we have collected about a child under the age of 13, parents/legal guardians should contact EMI as specified below under "Contact Us."
