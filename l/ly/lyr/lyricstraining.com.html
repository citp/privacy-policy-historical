<h3>January 2014</h3>
<p>The website available at <a href="http://lyricstraining.com">http://lyricstraining.com</a> and all its sub domains, or sections ("Website") and the mobile application <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elasthink.lyricstaplite" target="_blank">LyricsTap</a> ("Application") are operated by ELASTHINK, S.L. ("Elasthink"), with Tax Number ESB86550514 and registered office at Aniceto Gaitán 55, El Álamo, 28607, Madrid, Spain. You can contact with Elasthink at <a href="mailto:support@lyricstraning.com">support@lyricstraning.com</a>.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy establishes the rules for the processing of personal data of the Users (as defined in the Terms of Use) of the Website and the Application by Elasthink within the services rendered through the Website and the Application ("Services").</p>
<p>By accessing and using the Website as well as the Application, it is understood that the User has read and agreed to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Elasthink may amend this Privacy Policy at any time and thus we recommended that the User reviews this Privacy Policy on a regular basis. The date at the beginning of this Privacy Policy refers to the latest update of this Privacy Policy, which will be applicable from the date of publication.</p> 
<p>Some of the Services may be subject to specific privacy policies that will complement or, if in conflict with this Privacy Policy, supersede the terms of this Privacy Policy. The User will accept any specific privacy policies that may apply before the provision of such service.</p>
<p>Additionally, the access and use of the Website, and the downloading and use of the Applications and the Services are subject to the Terms of Use.</p>

<h2>1. PERSONAL DATA FILES, PURPOSES OF THE PROCESSING AND TYPES OF PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<p>To access some features of the Website or other elements of the Services, the User will have to register and create an account. For the registration, the User shall have to provide all data required as compulsory. On the contrary the User may not enjoy the Services.</p>
<p>User's data collected through the Services are stored in a personal data file named "REGISTRO DE USUARIOS DEL SITIO WEB LYRICSTRAINING". The purpose of this personal data file is the registration of the Users, authentication and identification of the same to access to the system, monitoring their progress, usage statistics, social interactions, and management notifications and communications by e-mail, including promotional information about the Services (including the content provided therein).</p>
<p>Only older than fourteen (14) years are eligible for registration in the Services, provided that they have completed the registration form and accepted this Privacy Policy as well as the Terms of Use.</p>
<p>The User may cancel at any time the registration in the Services through its account, or by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@lyricstraning.com">support@lyricstraning.com</a> with the necessary information for cancellation.</p> 
<p><a href="mailto:feedback@lyricstraining.com">feedback@lyricstraining.com</a> is provided by Elasthink to Users for comments and suggestions and <a href="mailto:support@lyricstraning.com">support@lyricstraning.com</a> is provided also by Elasthink to Users for help, report a problem or complaints about content. User's personal data resulting from emails to the above e-mail addresses are subject to this Privacy Policy and incorporated into the file "CONTACTOS DEL SITIO WEB LYRICSTRAINING" of Elasthink for managing questions, suggestions or complaints.</p>

<h2>2. COMMUNICATION OF PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<p>The Users can share the Website contents through their account at social networks as well as through their e-mail address. To comply with such User's request, Elasthink must provide the User's personal data to these networks or to the e-mail services provider and this is accepted by the User when it authorizes the sharing and Elasthink does not assume any liability in relation to the processing of the User's personal data by these networks or providers.</p>
<p>Elasthink shall collect the User's consent before using his/her personal data for any purpose other than those established in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>3. RIGHTS OF ACCESS, RECTIFICATION, CANCELATION AND OBJECTION.</h2>
<p>The User may modify his/her personal data at any time through his/her user account or by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@lyricstraning.com">support@lyricstraning.com</a>, with the necessary information for this purpose.</p> 
<p>Elasthink guarantees the exercise of the rights of access, rectification, cancelation and to object to the processing of personal data, as stated by Organic Law 15/1999.</p>
<p>Any data subject who intends to exercise any such rights in connection with personal data processed by Elasthink should contact Elasthink at the address stated above or by an email to <a href="mailto:support@lyricstraning.com">support@lyricstraning.com</a>, including in the message's subject a clear reference to the right he/she intends to exercise.</p>
<p>As stated by Royal Decree 1720/2007, the exercise of the above rights shall follow the procedure below.</p>

<p>The communication shall be addressed to the data controller and shall include:</p> 
<ol>
	<li>Name of the data subject; a copy of his/her identity card, passport or any other valid document which identifies him/her or, if applicable, of the representative of the data subject (in this latter case evidence of the authority to represent the data subject is also required).</li>
	<li>Request.</li>
	<li>Address where notifications may be served to the data subject, date and signature.</li>
	<li>Supporting documentation for the request being made, if any.</li>
</ol> 
<p>Elasthink shall answer the requests in all cases, regardless of whether or not there is personal data of the particular data subject within its personal data filing systems. If the request does not comply with the requirements above, Elasthink shall request the data subject to provide the necessary additional information.</p>

<h2>4. USE OF COOKIES AND IP ADDRESSES OF WEBSITE USERS</h2>
<p>The Website uses cookies to facilitate and customize user navigation through the Website.</p>
<p>A cookie is a piece of information that the computer or computers that host the Website give to the user's browser when accessing the Website. Elasthink uses "session cookies" that help the User to a better experience into the Website and that analyse the Website usage more accurately. For instance, the Website may set a cookie on the user's browser that keeps him/her from needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Website.</p> 
<p>Elasthink uses the "analytic cookies" from Google Analytics (www.google.com/analytics) for obtaining information about User's navigation as well as for measuring and analysing the audience.</p>
<p>Elasthink uses this information for improving the Website, detecting new needs and evaluate the Service.</p> 
<p>Elasthink does not use cookies with advertising purposes, nor to associate browsing data with individuals that have not been previously identified.</p>
<p>This Website also has access to the IP address with which each User accesses the Website. The IP address with which each User accesses the Website may be different each time. Additionally, different Users can share a single IP address. Even though Elasthink does not and will not perform any attempt to associate the IP address with specific individuals, accessing IP addresses could be regarded as a processing of personal data, given the possibility to identify the individual to which an IP address is associated (more a theoretical than an actual possibility), so according to the applicable data protection regulations, this Privacy Policy will apply in those cases.</p>
<p>Elasthink only uses cookies when, as required by Law, the Users have authorized them properly.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the User has capacity to control and/or to modify the cookie's configuration in his/her browser, as well as to delete these cookies in the section "Help" in the toolbar of his/her browser. We refer to that section to obtain more information about the reception of notifications when it is received a new cookie, and how to defuse them. Elasthink recommends that Users leave cookies turned on because they allow Users to benefit from some of the Website's features.</p>
