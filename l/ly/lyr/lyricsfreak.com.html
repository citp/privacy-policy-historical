</p><div align="justify">
	<p><i><b>Effective as of February 23, 2010</b></i>

	<br><br></p><p>We at Lyricsfreak.com respect the privacy concerns of the users of this site and have created this privacy policy to explain (1) what information we gather from you when you visit our site, (2) how we may use such information, (3) your choices concerning how we may use such information and (4) the security measures we take to protect such information. Some information is collected on this site automatically through our technology; other information is collected only when you choose to give it to us (e.g., when you set up an account, register for a contest or sign up for a specific online transaction). 

	<br><br></p><p><b>Information We Gather Automatically</b>

	<br><br></p><p>When you visit this site, certain non-personally identifying information is recorded automatically by the standard operation of our Internet servers. Information such as the type of browser being used, its operating system, and your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address (a number that your Internet service provider assigns to your computer whenever you surf the Internet) is gathered in order to facilitate our online operations and to assure an efficient online experience for you. We may use or share this information for security purposes, to generate group statistics about our user community, or as required by law. 
	<br><br></p><p>Among the purposes for which we may use such generally non-personally identifying information is for identification purposes in the event of an emergency threatening life or property, or where proper legal process allows using such information. For instance, we may use your IP address or other automatically recorded information, in cooperation with your Internet provider, to attempt to identify you if it is necessary to contact you or to bring legal action against you because you are violating the Terms of Service for use for this site, may be causing injury to or interference (intentionally or unintentionally) with our company's rights or property, or may be adversely affecting other users of this site or anyone else who could be harmed by your activities. 

	<br><br></p><p><b>Personal Information You Provide To Us</b>

	<br><br></p><p>We may request personally identifying information from you in a variety of contexts. For example, you may provide such data to us if you: (1) complete an online registration form (e.g., registering for an account, various sign-up forms for receiving email newsletters, registering for special offers, entering a contest/sweepstakes or responding to a survey); (2) fill out an order form to request information; (3) register to participate in message boards and chat rooms (if any) and other community features; or (4) purchase any products or services from us or another Lyricsfreak.com business. 
	<br><br></p><p>In such cases, the personally identifying information we request may include your name, email address, mailing address and zip code, phone number, and, where appropriate, a valid credit card number with expiration date (collectively, "Personal Information"). In addition, we may collect other non-personally identifying information such as your date of birth, gender, country of residence, language preference, hobbies and other information regarding your interaction with our site such as your viewing and listening habits, preferences and other customized activities in which you participate. Of course, you never have to answer any of the questions we ask you (nor choose to view or listen to any multimedia content or otherwise interact with our site), but refusal to do so may limit the products or services we can offer or provide to you. 
	<br><br></p><p>When you provide Personal Information to us, we may use that data to create a "Profile Page” for you, which will be held in a database using reasonable security measures to protect the data from unauthorized access. Others outside Lyricsfreak.com will not be allowed to see the data on your Profile Page except with your consent (see below). If you register to set up an account, you will be able to access your Profile Page at any time in order to update your individual Personal Information listed therein (see below under "How Can You Correct or Review Your Personal Information?" for more details).

We do not rent, sell or share credit card information with promotional partners or other third parties. 
	<br><br></p><p>We may have links to third party-operated sites that sell or license certain music, videos, or other goods mentioned, provided, or promoted on Lyricsfreak.com. Unless a site is within the Lyricsfreak.com domain (as generally indicated by a web address beginning with www.Lyricsfreak.com), it is not operated or controlled by Lyricsfreak.com, and any transactions that you may enter into with such sites will be subject to the privacy and security practices of the merchant with which you are transacting. Lyricsfreak.com and its parent company are not responsible for the privacy and security practices of sites not in our immediate control.

We follow generally accepted industry security standards to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and correctly use such Personal Information. When you provide credit card information, we use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption for that data. 
	Despite many advances in information security technology and procedures, however, no commercially deployed method of information transfer over the Internet or electronic data storage is known to be 100% secure. As a result, while we do strive to use modern and commercially reasonable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of that information during its transmission or its storage in our systems. 

	<br><br></p><p><b>For Parents Concerning the Privacy of Information on Their Children</b>

Currently, we do not collect any age-specific data on our site. If, in the future, we decide to collect any age-specific data on our site, we will, at a minimum, take reasonable steps to ensure that any users who may be under 13 years of age (and who attempt to complete the registration process on our site) are directed to another site within the Lyricsfreak.com family which specifically complies with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA. 
	
	<br><br></p><p><b>Cookies</b>

	<br><br></p><p>A "cookie" is a small text file that an Internet site can place on your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make using this site easier by, among other things, saving your passwords and preferences for you, keeping track of your shopping cart when you visit an online store or other similar purposes, and to help identify you whenever you return to our site, so you do not need to reenter your identification information. Most Internet browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. However, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to alert you when a cookie is being sent (note: you may need to consult your browser's "Help" area for instructions on how to do that). If you choose to disable your cookies setting or refuse to accept a cookie, some parts of this site will not function properly or may perform considerably slower. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized preferences or you may have difficulty downloading tablatures, watching videos or utilizing the Community Forums. Some of our web pages may contain electronic images (called "Clear GIFs", "Single-Pixel GIFs", or "Web Beacons") that allow us to count page views or to access cookies. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a Clear GIF. Typically, though, Clear GIFs are very small (1-by-1 pixel size) files. They are often invisible on a web page, but their presence can be detected within many Internet browsers by setting your browser to view web page "sources". Clear GIFs are so small in order not to use valuable space on the computer screen that is better used to display helpful content. We may also include Clear GIFs in our email products in order to determine information about the opening and reading of such emails. In addition, some advertising networks that serve ads on our web site may occasionally use Clear GIFs within banner advertisements. Clear GIFs set by Lyricsfreak.com generally are not used to collect, gather, monitor, or share personal information about our users, though they can be used in conjunction with cookies to record particular actions. We use Clear GIFs primarily to compile aggregated, anonymous statistics about web site or email product usage. 

	<br><br></p><p><b>Message Boards, Chat Rooms and Instant Messaging</b>

	<br><br></p><p>If you visit a message board, chat room or utilize an instant messaging service on this site, if any, you are solely responsible for the content of messages you post there. You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose Personal Information (for example, your name, street address, email address, or telephone number) on message boards, chat rooms or instant messaging services, that information can be read, collected and used by other users of these services and may result in unsolicited messages, both commercial and otherwise. You agree that by participating in such online public forums, you will not use such forums for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by the Lyricsfreak.com community guidelines that may be in effect from time to time in connection with such service. We reserve the right to terminate your access to this site or to take other protective steps if you violate those terms. 

	<br><br></p><p><b>Links to Other Sites</b>

	<br><br></p><p>We do not endorse and are not responsible for the content or practices of web sites operated by companies outside of Lyricsfreak.com that may be linked to this site. You should not assume that their privacy policies or practices are the same as those followed by our company or by other Lyricsfreak.com companies. Visitors to any such web sites should refer to their respective privacy policies and practices. 

	<br><br></p><p><b>How to Contact Us</b>

	<br><br></p><p>If you have any questions or complaints about our Privacy Policy, you can contact our customer service department at <img src="/i/email_webmaster.png" width="161" height="13" alt="Webmaster email" align="absmiddle">. When we receive such inquiries about our Privacy Policy, we will use the Personal Information (such as your email address) only to respond to your question or comment. However, if your question raises one or more issues that affect our promotional partners, we may also share your question with them in order to provide a response. 

	<br><br></p><p><b>Changes in This Privacy Policy</b>

	<br><br></p><p>We reserve the right to modify, alter or otherwise update this Privacy Policy at any time, so we encourage you to review this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes that we consider material in our privacy practices, we will notify you in this space. We may also attempt to notify you of any such material changes to our privacy practices via email or by placing a notice on our home page. 

	<br><br></p><p><b>Acceptance of This Privacy Policy</b>

	<br><br></p><p>By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of your Personal Information by Lyricsfreak.com in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
