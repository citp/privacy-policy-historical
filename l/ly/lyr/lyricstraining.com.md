# Privacy Policy | LyricsTraining

##### Last Updated: May 24, 2018

## 1\. General

LyricsTraining is a service for learning languages in a fun and innovative way through music, videos and song lyrics.

Both the website [https://lyricstraining.com](https://lyricstraining.com/) with all its variants and subdomains, as well as the app with the same name (<https://lyricstraining.com/app>) available for Android and iOS devices, are owned by ELASTHINK, S.L. (hereinafter " **Elasthink** ") located at Calle Fuerteventura 9, Alovera, 19208, Guadalajara, Spain.

In **Elasthink** , we take your privacy very seriously, for this we use all the necessary technical and human means to make sure they do not fall into the wrong hands. Under no circumstances will we give your information to third parties without your consent.

Recently we modified our Privacy Policy to make it easier for our users to understand, in compliance with the new European **General Data Protection Regulation** ([GDPR](https://www.eugdpr.org/)) which comes into effect on May 25, 2018.

These are the data we request to register you and create a new user account:
