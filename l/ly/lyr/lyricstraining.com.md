## 2\. COMMUNICATION OF PERSONAL DATA

The Users can share the Website contents through their account at social networks as well as through their e-mail address. To comply with such User's request, Elasthink must provide the User's personal data to these networks or to the e-mail services provider and this is accepted by the User when it authorizes the sharing and Elasthink does not assume any liability in relation to the processing of the User's personal data by these networks or providers.

## 3\. RIGHTS OF ACCESS, RECTIFICATION, CANCELATION AND OBJECTION.

The User may modify his/her personal data at any time through his/her user account or by sending an e-mail to [support@lyricstraning.com](mailto:support@lyricstraning.com), with the necessary information for this purpose.

Elasthink guarantees the exercise of the rights of access, rectification, cancelation and to object to the processing of personal data, as stated by Organic Law 15/1999.

Any data subject who intends to exercise any such rights in connection with personal data processed by Elasthink should contact Elasthink at the address stated above or by an email to [support@lyricstraning.com](mailto:support@lyricstraning.com), including in the message's subject a clear reference to the right he/she intends to exercise.

If the request does not comply with the requirements above, Elasthink shall request the data subject to provide the necessary additional information.

## 4\. USE OF COOKIES AND IP ADDRESSES OF WEBSITE USERS

The Website uses cookies to facilitate and customize user navigation through the Website.

A cookie is a piece of information that the computer or computers that host the Website give to the user's browser when accessing the Website. Elasthink uses "session cookies" that help the User to a better experience into the Website and that analyse the Website usage more accurately. For instance, the Website may set a cookie on the user's browser that keeps him/her from needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Website.

Elasthink uses the "analytic cookies" from Google Analytics (www.google.com/analytics) for obtaining information about User's navigation as well as for measuring and analysing the audience.

Elasthink uses this information for improving the Website, detecting new needs and evaluate the Service.

Elasthink does not use cookies with advertising purposes, nor to associate browsing data with individuals that have not been previously identified.

This Website also has access to the IP address with which each User accesses the Website. The IP address with which each User accesses the Website may be different each time. Additionally, different Users can share a single IP address. Even though Elasthink does not and will not perform any attempt to associate the IP address with specific individuals, accessing IP addresses could be regarded as a processing of personal data, given the possibility to identify the individual to which an IP address is associated (more a theoretical than an actual possibility), so according to the applicable data protection regulations, this Privacy Policy will apply in those cases.

Elasthink only uses cookies when, as required by Law, the Users have authorized them properly.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the User has capacity to control and/or to modify the cookie's configuration in his/her browser, as well as to delete these cookies in the section "Help" in the toolbar of his/her browser. We refer to that section to obtain more information about the reception of notifications when it is received a new cookie, and how to defuse them. Elasthink recommends that Users leave cookies turned on because they allow Users to benefit from some of the Website's features.
