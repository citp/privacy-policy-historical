Information Security

The servers are stored in facilities with high security, access restricted to unauthorized personnel, fire detection and response systems.

Physical and Administrative Security

We employ reasonable physical and administrative safeguards to protect your Personal Information. While we will use such efforts, we cannot and will not insure the security of your information. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any disclosure of data due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access or other acts of third-parties, or acts or omissions beyond our reasonable control.

**For Parents Concerning the Privacy of Information on Their Children**

Children under 13 are not allowed to use LyricsFreak. If you are based in the EEA you may only use LyricsFreak if you are over the age at which you can provide consent to data processing under the laws of your country or if verifiable parental consent for your use of LyricsFreak has been provided to us. If you are a parent and you learn that your child is using LyricsFreak and you don't want them to, please contact us at privacy@LyricsFreak.com.

**International Operations and Transfers Out of Switzerland and the EEA**

LyricsFreak is a worldwide service. By using LyricsFreak, you authorize us to transfer and store your information outside your home country, including in the United States, for the purposes described in this policy. The privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your information in these countries may not be the same as in your home country.

We take additional measures when information is transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA). This includes having standard clauses approved by the European Commission in our contracts with parties that receive information outside the EEA. We also rely on European Commission adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, for data transfers to countries outside the EEA.

**Cookies**

A "cookie" is a small text file that an Internet Service can place on your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make using this Service easier by, among other things, saving your passwords and preferences for you, keeping track of your shopping cart when you visit an online store or other similar purposes, and to help identify you whenever you return to our Service, so you do not need to reenter your identification information. Most Internet browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. However, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to alert you when a cookie is being sent (note: you may need to consult your browser's "Help" area for instructions on how to do that). If you choose to disable your cookies setting or refuse to accept a cookie, some parts of this Service will not function properly or may perform considerably slower. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized preferences or you may have difficulty loading lyrics. Some of our web pages may contain electronic images (called "Clear GIFs", "Single-Pixel GIFs", or "Web Beacons") that allow us to count page views or to access cookies. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a Clear GIF. Typically, though, Clear GIFs are very small (1-by-1 pixel size) files. They are often invisible on a web page, but their presence can be detected within many Internet browsers by setting your browser to view web page "sources". Clear GIFs are so small in order not to use valuable space on the computer screen that is better used to display helpful content. We may also include Clear GIFs in our email products in order to determine information about the opening and reading of such emails. In addition, some advertising networks that serve ads on our web Service may occasionally use Clear GIFs within banner advertisements. Clear GIFs set by LyricsFreak generally are not used to collect, gather, monitor, or share Personal Information about our users, though they can be used in conjunction with cookies to record particular actions. We use Clear GIFs primarily to compile aggregated, anonymous statistics about web Service or email product usage.

Some of the advertisements and other services that appear on our Service are delivered to you by Internet advertising companies. These companies utilize certain technologies including cookies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect anonymous information about your visit to our sites and other web sites. If you would like more information about this practice or to opt out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to provide targeted ads, please visit [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

**Links to Other Sites**

We do not endorse and are not responsible for the content or practices of web sites operated by companies outside of LyricsFreak that may be linked to this Service. You should not assume that their privacy policies or practices are the same as those followed by our company or by other LyricsFreak companies. Visitors to any such web sites should refer to their respective privacy policies and practices.

If you have any questions or complaints about our Privacy Policy, you can contact us at 268 Bush Street, #3044, San Francisco, CA 94104 or privacy@LyricsFreak.com. When we receive such inquiries about our Privacy Policy, we will use the Personal Information (such as your email address) only to respond to your question or comment. However, if your question raises one or more issues that affect our promotional partners, we may also share your question with them in order to provide a response.
