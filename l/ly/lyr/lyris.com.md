### **Notice**

You can visit and navigate through our main, corporate Web Site ([www.lyris.com](http://www.lyris.com/)) to gather information about our company and Services without telling us who you are and without otherwise revealing any type of Personal Information.

Our website does offer several opportunities for visitors to register for free information, seminars, or demonstration copies of our software, and for assistance in evaluating our software and Services. These registration forms are often linked to Lyris mailing lists, and require users to provide Personal Information (such as name and e-mail address), which we use to send users information about our company and our products and Services. We also use this information to contact site visitors by e-mail for marketing purposes if they have granted us permission (on the mailing list form or other forms on our website) to send it to them, and for administrative purposes such as providing time and location of seminars. Users may also be contacted by phone or postal mail for marketing purposes.

We use information that is not Personal Information (e.g., IP address) to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. IP addresses are also used to gather broad, personally non-identifiable demographic information, such the countries in which our Web site visitors live.

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We also have third party cookies and other tracking technologies on our site that collect data in the aggregate only.

Our website contains testimonials that contain information such as Customer names and titles. Lyris obtains the consent of each Customer prior to posting any information on such a list or posting testimonials.

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a colleague our site, we request to receive from you Personal Information about your friend and you, such as name, company name, email address, and phone number. We only use this information to contact the referred colleague (once) to see if they wish to receive information from us and to track the success of our referral program. This Personal Information is not otherwise used if the referred colleague does not wish to have contact from us. If the referred person agrees to be contacted by Lyris, then their Personal Information is retained and used by us in the same way as we retain and use Personal Information as described above.

Our Web site includes Widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company _(_ e.g. displaying the news, opinions, music, etc _)._ Personal Information, such as your email address, may be collected through the Widget. Cookies may also be set by the Widget to enable it to function properly. Information collected by this Widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it, which you can access by scrolling over the Widget.

We allow users to access Facebook Connect to interact with friends and to share on Facebook through Wall and friends' News Feeds. If you are already logged into our Web site and Facebook, when you click on “Connect with Facebook” you will be prompted to merge your profiles. If you are already logged into our Web site but not logged into Facebook, when you click on “Connect with Facebook” you will be prompted to enter your Facebook credentials or to “Sign up for Facebook.” By proceeding, you are allowing our Web site to access your information and you are also agreeing to the Facebook Terms of Use in your use of our Web site.

Conversely, if you are not currently registered as a Lyris user and you click on “Sign in Using Facebook,” you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register and join our Web site. Once you register on our Web site and Connect with Facebook, you will be able to automatically post recent activity back to Facebook. You have the option to disable Facebook Connect at any time by logging into “My Profile” and clicking on “My Facebook Profile.” Further, you can edit privacy settings for the reviews that appear on Facebook or disconnect this service by visiting the Facebook Application Settings page.

Our website contains links to other sites. Lyris is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites and recommends that you check the privacy policies of other sites to be aware of how your information is being used.

### **Choice**

Any Personal Information collected by Lyris is used for the sole purpose of communicating with prospects, Customers, and contacts that have requested to receive information from us regarding specific marketing events, materials, or other information specifically advertised by Lyris in promotional material. You have the ability to “opt-out” or unsubscribe from any Lyris’ communications via email, phone, mail, or fax (provided below) at anytime. Lyris also provides opt-out information in all marketing communications via an “unsubscribe” link in communication emails which directly unsubscribes you from any further communication from Lyris.

### **Access**

We allow our Web site visitors to access their Personal Information and allow them to correct, amend or delete inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. Customers may request that we update, amend, or delete their Personal Information by following the Profile Update link in every Lyris e-mail communication. Alternatively, you can contact us as described below if you would like your Personal Information deleted. We will respond to your request within 30 business days.

We will retain your Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with information or services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us as described below. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

### **Onward Transfers**

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Statement. The Personal Information we collect is not shared, rented, or sold to any third-parties. We may provide your Personal Information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information _only as necessary to provide_ these services to us. We may also disclose your personal information:

  * as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process; 
  * when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request; 
  * if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information; and 
  * to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.



### **Lyris’s Provision of Services to its Customers**

Lyris is a provider of email marketing solutions. Our Services include Customer database management and analysis, e-mail delivery, e-mail tracking, and website tracking. Some of our products are offered as application Services, meaning that we host a software application that our Customers access via the worldwide web. Each Customer understands that in the course of providing our Services to it, we collect or receive information about the individual to whom our Customer directs its marketing messages. Some of the information that we collect and store on our Customers’ behalf is personally identifiable, meaning that it can be used to identify an individual person.

As between Lyris and our Customer, all of the information we receive from our Customer belongs to our Customer and not to Lyris. Lyris may use such information only as provided in our written agreement with the individual Customer. While our specific responsibilities regarding such information are found in these written Customer agreements, Lyris does not allow individual information collected and stored for one Customer to be accessed or used by any other Lyris Customer (or by Lyris on its own behalf). We reserve a limited right to use our Customers’ information to compile aggregated statistics, which we use to report such facts as how many emails we have delivered. However, we do not disclose this information in such a way as to enable anyone to identify a Customer or any individual. Our Customer agreements also permit us to disclose any information if required by law or court order, and to access a Customer’s email addresses in order to unsubscribe an individual who asks us to do so.

In our Customer agreements, we require each Customer to abide by all laws, rules and regulations that are applicable to the Customer’s use of our Services (such as CAN-SPAM), and we promise each Customer that we will do the same with respect to our provision of Services. We ask each Customer to post a privacy policy that covers the Customer’s use of our Services. We also request the Customer to acquire and maintain all rights that allow us to provide the Services, such as to receive the information that we collect and store on the Customer’s behalf.

For any email list that we manage on behalf of a Customer, the email recipients can unsubscribe from the list via a link in the footer of most e-mail messages that we deliver. Alternatively, recipients can reply to an e-mail message according to the instructions provided at the bottom of the message. Finally, a recipient can contact us as provided below and we will manually unsubscribe you from any list.

Our Services sometimes use cookies to help our Customers better analyze the success of their email and other online marketing campaigns. The cookies we use are often correlated with information that can identify an individual, but this information is not shared with anyone other than the Customer. As with the email addresses and other information we maintain and process for each of our Customers, this information is not used by us except as described above or shared with other Lyris Customers.

Lyris is not responsible for its Customers' own privacy policies and makes no representations about their accuracy. If you have questions about our Customers' practices, we recommend you check their privacy policies and/or contact them directly.

### **Data Security**

Lyris takes reasonable steps to protect Personal Information in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. However, we cannot guarantee the security of information on, or transmitted via, the Internet

### **Data Integrity**

Lyris processes Personal Information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected or authorized by the owning individual. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.

### **Safe** **Harbor** ****

The Company respects and protects the individual privacy and confidence of our Customers, stakeholders, employees, business partners and others who may use our Services. Protecting consumer privacy is important to the Company. The Company adheres to the Safe Harbor Agreement concerning the transfer of personal data from the European Union (“EU”) to the United States of America ([European Union Safe Harbor](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/ "European Union Safe Harbor")). Accordingly, we follow the Seven (7) Safe Harbor Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce (the “Principles”) with respect to all such data. Our privacy practices are self-certified as part of the [U.S. Commerce Department's Safe Harbor Program](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/ "U.S. Commerce Department's Safe Harbor Program"). Information regarding the E.U. Safe Harbor Framework can be found at: <http://export.gov/safeharbor>.

If there is any conflict between the policies in this Statement and the Principles, the Principles shall govern. This Statement outlines our general policy and practices for implementing the Principles, including the types of information we gather, how we use it and the notice and choice affected individuals have regarding our use of and their ability to correct that information.

### **Enforcement**
