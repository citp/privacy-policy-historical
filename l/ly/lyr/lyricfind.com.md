# LyricFind.com Privacy Policy

**Your Privacy On This Site**

 **What personally identifiable information is collected on this site?**  
No personally identifiable information is collected by LyricFind.com or it's affiliates, unless entered by you (such as information collected by CDnow when ordering a CD through us, or subscribing to our mailing list).  [DoubleClick](http://www.doubleclick.net/) & [Engage Media](http://www.engage.com/), LyricFind's ad serving companies, collect anonymous data profiling the patterns of your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services of interest to you; no identifying information is collected.  Anonymous clickstream information is collected for every visitor to this site, using cookies and/or IP's. This includes pages viewed, date & time, and browser type. IP numbers are not stored, but are temporarily used to determine domain type and in some cases, geographic region. There is no association between this information and a visitor's identity.  To view Engage's Privacy Policy, please visit <http://www.flycast.com/about_us/about-privacy.html>.  To view DoubleClick's Privacy Policy, please visit <http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy>.

**How is it used?  
**The information is used by Engage to build anonymous behavioral profiles which are written to the Engage Knowledge database -- securely housed at the Engage data center. These profiles are accessed by Engage-enabled web sites to offer you personalized content and promotions, and to target relevant, more interesting ads -- all without knowing your identity. Again, there is no association between an Engage Knowledge profile and a visitor's identity. For more information, [click here](http://www.engage.com/privacy/knowprivacy.htm). 

For users who prefer not to have their web usage information reflected in Engage Knowledge, Engage provides an [opt-out procedure](http://www.engage.com/privacy/koptout.htm).

The information culled by Engage and DoubleClick may also be used to serve more relevant and targeted ads to anonymous users when visiting this or other sites in the DoubleClick or Engage networks.
