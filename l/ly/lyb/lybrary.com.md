We do not sell, rent, trade, or give away e-mail addresses or other personal information of our customers. Your information is safe and secure, and will only be used by us to send information you asked for. And this will never change - guaranteed! Orders are stored in encrypted form on our server. We do not store credit card information. So even in the unlikely event of a breach of security at our webhost, credit card information cannot be stolen, because it is not present. Other personal data is encrypted and thus safe from unauthorized use.
