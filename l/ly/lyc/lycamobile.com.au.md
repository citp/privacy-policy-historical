  * Information that you provide by filling in forms on our website [www.lycamobile.com](http://www.lycamobile.com/).au.  This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our website, subscribing to our products and services, posting material or requesting further products or services.  We may also ask you for information when you report a problem with our website or our mobile telephone services and products.

  * We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for market research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them.
  * Other data, from time to time, to help us provide you with improved products and services.  For example, now and again we might ask you to fill in a questionnaire, just so you can let us know how we're doing. 

  
  
**IP ADDRESSES AND COOKIES**  
  
We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.  This is statistical data about a user’s browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.   
  
For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer.  Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive.  They help us to improve our website and to deliver a better and more personalised service.  Cookies enable us:   
  
  * To estimate our audience size and usage pattern. 
  * To store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise our website according to your individual interests. 
  * To speed up your searches. 
  * To recognise you when you return to our website. 

  
  
You may refuse to accept Cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of Cookies.  However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our website.  Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse Cookies, our system will issue Cookies when you log on to our website.   
  
Please note that our advertisers may also use Cookies, over which we have no control.   
  
**WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA**  
  
Any information sent to us is encrypted (scrambled) using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.  This is industry standard encryption technology that protects your Personal Data whilst being sent over the internet from being intercepted and misused by third parties.  When it reaches us, we then store it on a secure server so that it can only be read by authorised personnel.  Although we make every effort to create a secure environment for your Personal Data, Lycamobile cannot guarantee the safety of any personal information you transmit to Lycamobile online.   
  
The Personal Data that we collect from you may be transferred to and stored in a destination outside Australia.  It may be processed by staff that operate outside Australia and who work for us or for one of our suppliers.  Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of payment details and the provision of support services. For example, Lycamobile uses call centre and technical sevices from an associated company in India.  
  
Where the data protection laws of these countries do not provide the same level of data protection as in Australia, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights are at least compliant with the requirements of Australian law particularly the National Privacy Principles, including requiring appropriate security measures from such third parties, set out in a contract between us, to protect your Personal Data; and monitoring compliance with such security measures for the lifetime of our relationship with such third parties.   
  
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.  We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day).  We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in Sydney).  We may make use of the Personal Data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.   
  
We may disclose your Personal Data to any member of our group of companies in respect of the uses set out above.
