Use of data 

Lyoness uses your personal data in full compliance with statutory stipulations. The personal data provided by you upon registration as a Lyoness Member and during the course of your Membership will be strictly collected and processed within the framework of fulfilling our contractual duties to you and only if you give us your express consent. We will use your data to communicate with you, in order to verify your identity, to enable you to access your personal Member section on the Lyoness Website, to process your inquiries and orders and to make our services available to you. In addition, we use your data to determine and assign the corresponding Member Benefits arising from your Membership in the Lyoness Loyalty Program to you. If we have your separate consent to do so, we will use your data to let you know, e.g. about any sales and specials that our Loyalty Merchant companies are offering. 

Data Security and transfer 

In order to protect your data, among other things, we implement encryptions during data transmission (SSL-Encryption), firewalls, hackerdeterring programs and additional security methods based on state-of-the-art technology. The use of your personal data will basically take place through Lyoness Europe AG as the contractual party of the Members, which uses the individual regional companies as well as the Lyoness Group AG for processing purposes. Your personal data can, however, be forwarded to certain service providers as well within the Lyoness Group as follows: We are authorized to use certain service providers to assist us with the processing of our services, the communication with our Members and the administration of our online presence. We guarantee that we carefully select these service providers in order to ensure legal and safe data processing. In addition, these service providers have pledged to use any personal data solely for the intended purpose pursuant to our instructions and in accordance with the Austrian data protection provisions. You can find a complete list of all companies comprising the Lyoness Group on the following website:  
<http://www.lyoness-corporate.com/en-US/Company/Organisation/>. 

The concerned services include but are not limited to the following: contact via electronic means (e.g. Email or SMS), via social media (such as Facebook, etc.) by fax, telephone or postal mail regarding information on products and campaigns offered by Loyalty Merchant companies, the identification of sales which correspond with your interests, taking satisfaction surveys, the operation of hotlines as well as the processing of transactions. If your personal information is required in order to provide a concrete service to you, we will give the Loyalty Merchant companies the necessary personal data. The Loyalty Merchant companies, in turn are obligated to use your data exclusively for the respective specific usage pursuant to the Austrian data protection provisions. Lyoness is an internationally active Group. Our business activities, management structures and technical infrastructure cross national borders. We are therefore able to send your personal data abroad. The transmission of your personal data to the Members of the European Economic area, to Switzerland and to other countries with an adequate level of data protection (§12 Par. 2 DSG 2000) does not require further consent. However, in the event that your personal data is to be sent to countries other than the ones detailed above, we will ask for your express prior consent. We will not forward your personal information to any persons other than those associated businesses, service providers and Lyoness companies detailed above. The forwarding of any such information which may be required for the purpose of executing an agreement shall be subject to your express prior consent.

We take special care to protect the privacy needs of children under the age of 13 and encourage parents to be an active participant in their child's online activities. We abide by the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other relevant laws. Our Site does not target and is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we will not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from them. If we discover personal data from a child through an adult-oriented site, we will eliminate that data. Right of revocation, information, data changes and contact You have the option of revoking your consent to the use of your data in the future at any time without providing a reason.
