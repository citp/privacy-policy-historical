## 1.   INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU

We collect several types of information about visitors to this Website and/or users of our services.  We may collect this information either directly when you provide it to us or automatically as you navigate through the Website.

   (a)    _Personally Identifiable Information_.  ‘Personally Identifiable Information’ refers to information by which you may be personally identified, such as your name, email address, or school.  We will collect and process such data about you when you register for a service/create an account, subscribe to a newsletter, submit feedback, enter a contest, fill out a survey, or send us a communication.  When ordering products or services on the Website, you may also be asked to provide a credit card number and other payment-related information.  You may also provide information to be published or displayed **("posted")** on public areas of the Website (such as blogs, forums, message boards, and the like), or transmitted to other users of the Website using ‘sharing’ features **(collectively, "User Contributions").**   Your User Contributions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk.  We cannot control the actions of other users of the Website with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions.  Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary.  If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.  We do not collect more personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary for a child to participate in an activity on the Website.  If you are a school and you use a lynda.com service for children under the age of 13, you are responsible for obtaining consent from the parents/legal guardians of each child you wish to allow to participate in using any lynda.com service.  A child using the service will be able to participate in certain activities on the Website such as taking online educational and informational courses.

   (b)    _Non-Personally Identifiable Information_.  We may collect, or our third party ad server and/or content server may collect, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information, that does not by itself identify a specific individual.  Such information tells us about your equipment, browsing actions, the resources that you access and use on the Website, your Internet Protocol (‘IP’) address, operating system and browser type.  We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our Website and to gather demographic information.  Our third party ad servers will provide us with summary, but not individual, reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon at our Website.  The information that we collect automatically is ‘statistical’ in nature.  It helps us to deliver a better and more personalized service to users, by enabling us to estimate usage patterns, customize our Website according to your individual preferences, and speed up your searches.

   (c)    _Device Information_.  When you download our mobile application and use our services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use and the operating system version, so we know the best application version to provide you with.  We do not ask you for, access or track any location based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our Mobile Application or services.

## 2.   WHERE WE STORE DATA

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area **("EEA").**   It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our service providers.  Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.  By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.  lynda.com will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
