## 1\. INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU

We collect several types of information about visitors and/or users of our Services. We may collect this information either directly when you provide it to us or automatically as you navigate through the Websites or App.

(a) We will collect and process your personal data when you register for a Service/create an account, subscribe to a newsletter, submit feedback, enter a contest, fill out a survey, or send us a communication. When ordering products or services on the Websites or App, you may also be asked to provide a credit card number and other payment-related information. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is required to use the Services (e.g. registering an account) and some is voluntary. If you do not provide data when needed for a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.

We also collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers and/or software, to administer our Services, and to gather demographic information.

(b) We may collect certain information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. Such information tells us about your equipment, browsing actions, and the resources that you access and use through the Services, such as your operating system and browser type. We use analytics and similar services, as explained in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.lynda.com/aboutus/cookie-policy), to help us to deliver a better and more personalized service to users by enabling us to estimate usage patterns, customize our Services according to your individual preferences, and speed up your searches.

(c) When you download our App and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use and the operating system version, so we know the best version of the application to provide you. We do not ask you for, access, or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our App or Services.

(d) When you contact us for customer support we may collect additional information to resolve your issue and may request you to bind your Lynda account with your LinkedIn account to improve your customer service experience. However, if you elect not to bind, you will still be able to receive customer service.

(e) **We are not a site targeted at children or those under the age of 16.** If you are a school and you use a Lynda service for children under the age of 16, or the equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, you are responsible for obtaining consent from the parents/legal guardians of each child you wish to allow to participate in using any of our Services. A child using our Services will be able to participate in certain limited activities (such as taking online educational and informational courses).

## 2\. WHERE WE STORE DATA

By submitting your personal data, you agree to the transfer, storing and processing of your data outside of the country where you reside. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## 3\. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

We use information held about you in the following ways:

  * To present content from our Services in an effective manner for you and for your computer or mobile device

  * To allow you to participate in interactive features of our Services, when you choose to do so

(a) We provide and support some of our Services through contractual arrangements with service providers and other third parties. We and our service providers use your personal data to operate our Websites and to deliver Services. For example, we must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for products and services purchased on our Websites; and provide order information to third parties that help us deliver the Services.

(b) We will also disclose personal data in the following circumstances: (i) if it is required by law enforcement or judicial authorities, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation; (ii) if we have a good faith belief that we are required or permitted to do so by law or legal process; (iii) to protect our rights, reputation, property or the safety of us or others; (iv) to defend or enforce our rights or your obligations; (v) if the disclosure is required by mandatory professional standards; (vi) to a third party with your prior consent to do so; or (vii) if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to enforce or apply any contracts or agreement that may exist between you and us including this Privacy Policy, our [Website Use Policy](https://www.lynda.com/aboutus/website-use-policy) and our [Terms of Service](https://www.lynda.com/aboutus/lotterms.aspx). This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

(c) In the event that LinkedIn decides to sell all or part of its stock or assets or enter into a merger, we reserve the right to include your data, including personal data, among the assets transferred to the acquiring or surviving company.
