# Privacy Policy – LKQD

1\. General

LKQD, a division of Nexstar Digital Digital LLC (“LKQD”, “we”, “our”, or “us”), provides a range of online advertising services, including an advertising platform that our customers use to deliver advertisements to viewers. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) describes, among other things, the types of information collected through use of our services (“Services”), including how such information may be used and/or disclosed, and our practices for data choice. To review our privacy policy governing our corporate website, please go to Corporate Privacy Policy. Through the Services, LKQD utilizes its proprietary infrastructure to provide its clients a myriad of inventory sources. Such infrastructure affords LKQD the opportunity, on behalf of its clients, to display and serve ads to consumers who access a particular website, mobile application, or online content.

LKQD is committed to safeguarding your privacy and participates in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) self-regulatory organization and strives to comply with the organizations’ self-regulatory principles. We will notify you of changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new policy on this website. Review our Privacy Policy regularly so that you can stay informed of our current practices, as they may change in the future. 

2\. The LKQD Advertising Platform

The LKQD Platform helps publishers and advertiser groups power their business by generating revenue from advertisements. To help publishers and advertiser groups serve accurate and relevant ads, we collect and use a variety of information through our platform, which we describe below

3\. About Data Collected and Used by the LKQD Platform

We collect information about viewers of the advertisements that are made available through our platform. The primary purpose for collecting this information is to enhance the likelihood that an advertisement seen by a viewer is relevant to the viewer. We also use the data we collect to improve and analyze our service, create new services, and report performance metrics to our customers. The information we collect is not intended to personally identify a specific viewer. For example, we do not collect a viewer’s name, address, phone number, or account information. Instead, we collect information that indicates that a specific device tends to be used in ways that suggest certain types of advertisements would be relevant to the device’s user.

The data the LKQD Platform collects and uses includes, but is not limited to:  
a. The type of browser, hardware model, operating system, unique device identifiers, your Internet provider, and IP address.  
b. Device IDs associated with a User’s mobile device. This includes mobile advertising identifiers such as Apple’s IDFA and Android’s Advertising ID.  
c. Information about websites, applications, and other content that you interact with, which may be tied to a unique identifier, and can include the date and time of your visit to a website, and the referring URL or mobile application name.  
d. Web pages and advertisements you view.  
e. Clickstream data.  
f. Unique identifiers that we, or a partner of LKQD has associated with a User’s browser, through browser cookies, web beacons, or similar locally stored objects or code that can identify the physical location of mobile devices and operating system device identifiers.  
g. Information about your interaction with video content, such as the type of content viewed.  
h. Information or inferences about a user’s interests.  
(collectively, “Services Data”)

In addition to data that we collect, we receive information about consumers from third parties to enable targeted advertising on the website(s) and application(s) that we support. The collection and use of that data is governed by the privacy policy and legal terms of the terms of the data collector and the website using the data; it is not governed by LKQD. Additionally, we may associate user’s devices using probabilistic methodologies to accurately target and serve ads across devices.

Services Data does not include information that by itself, individually identifies an individual, such as your e-mail address, phone number, or name.

For the purposes of EU data protection law, some Services Data such as an IP address, device ID and other data may be considered personal data. LKQD does not however collect any "sensitive" or "special categories" as defined under EU data protection law. LKQD is the controller of the personal information it collects from you. 

4\. How We Collect Information?

When LKQD, or LKQD, on behalf of a client, purchases online advertisements on a website/application, and such individual interacts with such advertisement or visits the website/application, Services Data is collected on such website or application through the use of cookies, web beacons, pixels, tags, and other similar technologies. Once collected, the Services Data may be used by LKQD to target advertisements, measure the effectiveness of advertisements, and to deliver interest-based advertisements on behalf of LKQD’s clients.

5\. How We Use the Data We Collect

The purpose for collecting this information is to enhance the likelihood that an advertisement seen by a viewer is relevant to the viewer. We also use the data we collect to improve and analyze our service, create new services, and report performance metrics to our customers. The information we collect is not intended to personally identify a specific viewer. For example, we do not collect a viewer’s name, address, phone number, or account information. Instead, we collect information that indicates that a specific device tends to be used in ways that suggest certain types of advertisements would be relevant to the device’s user. We may use the data to create, or collect from LKQD partners, data segments associated with UIDs, cookies, or device advertising IDs. Data Segments may be based on inferred interests or geo-graphic locations, such as those collected by mobile applications.

Cookies. A cookie is a small text file created by a website and stored in a user’s web browser. LKQD uses cookies to store data for: advertising and/or interest-based advertising purposes; delivery and reporting of advertisements; tracking users’ responses to an ad (e.g., click rate and conversions); reviewing the frequency and time of the display of an advertisement; storage of user preferences; and the collection, aggregation and analysis of anonymous tracking data to help measure and track traffic and general user behavior. Further, to better serve relevant ads to you, we may also assign an identifier (“ID”) to your device, computer, or browser when serving an ad. The ID may be implemented on your computer/device through a cookie. Such method does not enable LKQD to personally identify you. The ID can be used to attempt to match an assigned user by inference, based on the user’s activities tracked across multiple devices or browsers. 

Tags, Beacons, and Pixels. Tags are computer codes incorporated into a HTML/JavaScript code of a web page and delivered to a web browser or application when the web page loads. A beacon, web beacon, or a pixel is a transparent web image that can be placed on a web page. Overall, LKQD utilizes tags, beacons, and/or pixels to set cookies, collect data, extend audiences between multiple marketing partners, and to serve more relevant ads. 

Our third-party service providers, advertisers and affiliates may also use cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies to manage or measure the performance of the information displayed or delivered over a website/application. For more information regarding this use, please see Section 8. “How Do We Work With Third Parties?” section below.

6\. How Do We Use the Services Data?

The Services Data collected may be used by LKQD clients or by LKQD on behalf of its clients to: evaluate and modify existing services and features; compile demographic and geographic information regarding users; identify a target audience to serve an advertisement and obtain the best advertisement response rate; provide interest-based advertising; aggregate statistics related to the Services Data; develop new services and features that may be of interest to you; prepare advertising segments that may be used to target based on demographics, geography and/or relation to the content on the viewing page; control the amount of times a user may see an advertisement; sequentially organize ads for purposes of viewing; and analyze the response of users to the advertisements. Further, Services Data collected from a browser, website, computer, device, or other application may be used on another browser, website, computer, device, or other application linked to the browser, computer, website, or device on which such data was initially collected, or transferred to a third party for such purposes. To manage your preferences related to the collection of Services Data pursuant to such tracking, please see Section 10, “What Are Your Choices”. 

7\. How Do We Disclose Your Information?

We may share Services Data with our affiliates, service providers, clients, related companies, and advertisers. We may also disclose your Services Data in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request; when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or to anyone that could be harmed by such activities; in situations involving threats to the physical safety of any person; where it is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activity or suspected fraud; or as otherwise required by law. We may transfer Services Data to another company, if we are acquired by, sold to or merged with such company. 

Our agents and contractors who have access to your Services Data are required to protect the information in a manner consistent with our Privacy Policy and may not use the information for any other purposes other than to carry out the activity they are performing on our behalf. 

We continue to expand our online presence in order to offer users rich and deep interactive experiences. We may share information we collect about you so that we can provide you with information about products and services that might interest you.

We may share aggregated or anonymized Services Data, with third parties. Much of the information we collect is in the form of aggregated statistics, such as the traffic generated by visits on websites/applications and the habits and preferences of our audience. Such aggregated data does not include any information that would identify you personally. We may use such aggregated data and disclose it to third parties as we see fit.

8\. How Do We Work with Third Parties?

We may work with one or more advertisers, advertising agencies, advertising networks, service providers, and/or audience segment providers to help deliver advertisements or other content. These third parties may utilize cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your computer, mobile, or other device to serve you advertisements or content tailored to your perceived or stated interests and/or preferences based on information you provided, and/or your browsing behavior, on their websites and/or other sites and applications you have visited. These third parties may also use such technologies to help determine whether you previously have seen particular advertisements or content and to avoid sending you duplicates, and/or collect information from a browser, website, computer, device, or other application to link such information to another browser, website, computer, device, on which such data was initially collected. In doing so, these third parties collect information such as your browser type, your operating system, web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other click stream data. In all of the above instances, this Privacy Policy will not apply to any information collected by these third parties. This collection of information is not under our control and such third-party information practices may be different than ours.

Further, these third parties may offer you a way to choose not to have your information used for interest-based advertising purposes. To manage your preference for interest-based advertising provided by third parties, please see Section 10, “What Are Your Choices?” for more information.

9\. Protecting the Data We Collect

We take measures to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of your information. We carefully limit access to the database in which your personal information is stored. Additionally, we share and transfer your personal information only in the ways set forth in this privacy policy.

We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we may be required to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability. We may also (and you authorize us to) disclose personal information about you to credit agencies, collection agencies, and/or merchant database agencies, as we deem necessary.

15\. European Privacy Policy

If you are situated in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), the following provisions will apply in addition to the Privacy Policy to any Services Data which constitutes personal data. 

(a) Data Controller  
For the purposes of European data protection law, Nexstar Digital LLC is the data controller of personal information included in Services Data.

(b) Legal basis for processing  
We will process your personal data (a) for the purpose of legitimate interests pursued by us; or (b) because you have consented to the processing.  
Our legitimate interests include storing and accessing information necessary to provide the services; selecting, delivering and reporting on the effectiveness of advertisements; measuring the performance of advertisements and campaigns; personalizing the advertisements you receive; and investigating and preventing fraud.  
The legal basis for processing will depend on what data we are collecting and what we are using it for. However, we will not use your personal data for the purpose of our legitimate interests when our interests are overridden by the impact on your data protection interests or fundamental rights or freedoms. 

(c) Transferring your information outside Europe  
We are based in the US. When we collect personal information from you, it is therefore transferred to a destination outside the EEA. You acknowledge that unless you have opted out in accordance with Section 10 above, you consent to the transfer of your personal information to the United States.  
If we transfer your personal information to a third party service provider outside of the EEA, we will impose obligations on the recipients of that data to protect your information to the standard required in the EEA. 

(d) Retention of data  
We will keep your personal data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy or as required to comply with any legal obligations to which we are subject.  
If you have opted out in accordance with section 10 above, we will retain your information to enable us to comply with your preferences.

(e) Your rights  
Under EU data protection laws you have a number of rights in relation to your personal data. We respect and honor these rights and will help you to exercise them insofar as we are able. These rights are not absolute – in some cases they will not apply to you, or to the particular use that we are making of your data, and there are exceptions (for example if we have to process the data to comply with our own legal obligations) but if that is the case we will let you know. We aim to ensure that the information we hold about you is accurate at all times. 

At any time, you have the right:  
(i) to request access to or a copy of any personal data which we hold about you;  
(ii) to rectification of your personal data, if you consider that the information we are holding is inaccurate;  
(iii) to ask us to delete your personal data, if you consider that we do not have the right to hold it;  
(iv) to withdraw consent to our processing of your personal data (to the extent such processing is based on previously obtained consent);  
(v) to restrict processing of your personal data;  
(vi) to data portability (moving some of your personal data elsewhere) in certain circumstances;  
(vii) to object to your personal data being processed in certain circumstances; and  
(viii) to not be subject to a decision based on automated processing and to have safeguards put in place if you are being profiled based on your personal data.  
Any request from you for access to or a copy of your personal data must be in writing and we will endeavour to respond within a reasonable period and in any event within one month in compliance with data protection legislation. Because Services Data does not include your e-mail address, phone number, or name, you will need to provide us with additional information for us to identify the personal data we hold about you in order to respond to any request. 

You also have the right to make a complaint at any time to the supervisory authority in the country you are situated in.
