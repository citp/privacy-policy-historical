# Terms & Privacy policy-LK Bennett

### Terms & conditions

Any use by you of our website is conditional on your acceptance of these Terms and our Privacy statement. We may change these Terms without letting you know and therefore it is up to you to check this page for any changes. Your continued use of our website means that you have accepted these Terms and the Privacy statement.

**Company Details**  
This website is owned and operated by LK Bennett Limited, a company registered in England and Wales under registered number 2699136. The registered office is at 3 Cavendish Square, London W1G 0LB

**Contract for sale**   
The advertising of products on this site is an 'invitation to treat'. You will indicate by completing the appropriate order form on the site the products that you wish to order. At the same time you will complete an authorisation for us to recover, through your credit or debit card, payments due to us. This means that your order is an offer, not a contract of sale between you and LK Bennett, so prices and stock availability won't be contractually confirmed until you receive the 'confirmation of despatch' email which is sent out once credit card authorisation has been confirmed and stock levels have been checked. For the avoidance of doubt, the ‘order confirmation’ email that is sent out once you have placed an order is just an acknowledgement of your offer and should not be taken as our acceptance of that offer.

These terms and conditions cannot be varied except by changes made by LK Bennett on the site, which we may make from time to time. In particular, nothing said by any representative of LK Bennett will operate as a variation to these terms and conditions or constitutes a legal representation on behalf of them. 

**Pricing**

  * All online orders will be charged in British Pounds Sterling (£) and include Value Added Tax at the current rate, but exclude postage and packaging.
  * Prices quoted on the website are indicative only and are subject to change.
  * Prices on the website may differ from those in LK Bennett stores.



**Receipt of order**   
LK Bennett must receive payment in full for your order before it can be accepted. Once your credit card has been authorised and stock is checked, LK Bennett will send you an email receipt confirming your order. Please keep this receipt for your records.   
We can only accept orders for items that are in stock. In exceptional circumstances, if we are not able to fulfill an order we have accepted, your credit card will be re-funded with the original price and we will notify you by email. In no circumstances will we be liable to you for any additional amounts. 

LK Bennett reserve the right to refuse to supply any person for whatever reason. 

**Disclaimer**  
LK Bennett make every effort to keep the site up to date but cannot guarantee that this site and its contents are completely free of technical errors. By using this site, you acknowledge that you assume full responsibility for all costs associated with all necessary servicing or repairs of any equipment you use in connection with this site. We are also not liable for any damages associated with use of this site however caused. LK Bennett’s total liability for any claim howsoever arising shall not exceed the price of the goods supplied by LK Bennett to the customer, together with any postage costs incurred. LK Bennett shall not be liable for any consequential customer loss whether this arises from a breach of duty in contract or in any other way.

**Legal Governance**   
This website, its contents and any contracts arising out of it are governed by English law. By entering into a contract both parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of England and Wales. If any provision of these terms and conditions shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable for these terms and conditions and shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining provisions.

**Copyright and other rights**   
The website and all text, images, information, photographs contained within it, are owned by or licensed to LK Bennett. The copyright and all other intellectual property rights in the content contained on the website are the sole and exclusive property of LK Bennett.
