### BASIC CONFIDENTIALITY POLICY

It is policy that personal information, such as your name, postal and e-mail address or telephone number, is private and confidential. Accordingly, the personal information you provide is stored in a secure location and is accessible only by designated staff. It is used only for the purposes of things such as providing information requested, aggregate research, promotional purposes, further web site development and answering your questions.

### FUTURE CONTACT

If you also indicate that you would like to be on our mailing list or receive future information, we may contact you with information such as promotional items, product alerts and special announcements. You can be removed from the list any time you wish.

### NO RELEASE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES

Personal information will not be released to third parties (except to further the purpose for which you provide the information, such as fulfilling information requests, forwarding complaints, or if release is required by law or is pertinent to judicial or governmental investigations or proceedings.) There are no other circumstances under which we will provide or sell personal information to third parties.

### NO COMPUTER TRACKING OF IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

Our system is not set up to track, collect or distribute personal information about its visitors. It does recognize the hostname of visitors, but it will not track e-mail addresses. For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider our visitors use. We cannot, however, distinguish individual names, addresses or other personal information.

This Web site tracks information about the visits to our pages. We compile statistics that show the daily number of visitors to our sites, the daily requests we receive for particular files on our web sites, and what countries those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others. Again, these statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.
