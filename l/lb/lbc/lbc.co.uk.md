**About this Policy**

**We are Global!**  
We are part of “This is Global Limited” and we are obsessive about respecting the privacy of our listeners and customers.

This policy explains how we will collect information about you through interaction with us over the radio, on the TV, our charity activities or through any sales channel and what we will use it for. 

Any personal information you provide about yourself to us, may be shared across our “This is Global” Group but will only be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Firstly, please be aware that we do not aim to collect any personal information from individuals under the age of 13.

Please note, this Privacy Policy does not apply to websites or text services operated by third parties, who will have their own Policies covering the use of your personal information, or to those webpages which relate to Global Talent and Publishing which have separate Privacy and Cookie Policies.

**1\. How we will get in touch with you  
** When we first collect your personal information, we will tell you that we want to keep in contact with you to keep you informed about things that we believe you will be interested in.  
You have the right to request that we cease sending marketing communications, whether by e-mail or otherwise, to you. You can do this by checking certain boxes when we collect your personal information or by clicking the unsubscribe link in the marketing e-mails you receive from us. You can also do this by contacting us at privacy@thisisglobal.com.

**2\. Collection of Information  
** We collect personal information from you through your interaction via our websites, text services or other media such as giving your information to one of our roaming “street teams”. This may occur when you participate in, or sign up to, any of  This is Global’s services, such as competitions, research panels, or if you use any of our apps, register an account with one of our websites.   
The information we collect will vary depending on the service you request but could include name, address, phone number, email address, user name, password, age, gender, date of birth, household composition, comments, competition answers.
