# Privacy Policy | Mirum

This website is provided by Mirum Inc (“Mirum”). We take very seriously the privacy of our website users and the security of their personal information.

For your convenience, this website contains links to a number of other websites, both inside and outside Mirum. The privacy policies and procedures described here do not apply to those sites; we suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their data collection and distribution policies.

The purpose of this privacy policy is to set out the principles governing our use of personal information that we may obtain about you. By using the websites, or by registering as a user of the services that we provide, you agree to this use. We ask you to read this privacy policy carefully. Any dispute which may arise over privacy will be subject to this policy and the data protection notice (if any) incorporated into this website.

We may change our privacy policy from time to time. We therefore ask you to check it occasionally to ensure that you are aware of the most recent version that will apply each time you access this website.

## Personal information collection and use

Mirum will only collect personally identifiable data, such as your name or email address, when it is voluntarily submitted to us at this website.

From time to time, we may refer to that information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our services. We may use that information to contact you. We will not otherwise transfer the personally identifiable information you provide at this website to any third party unless otherwise disclosed to you.

## Non-personal information collection and use

In common with many commercial organizations we monitor the use of this website by collecting aggregate information. We may automatically collect non-personal information about you such as the type of internet browsers you use, the pages you visit or the website which directed you to our site. You cannot be identified from this information and it is used only to assist us in providing an effective service on this website.

## Use of cookies

Cookies are small files which are sent to your web browser and stored on your computer’s hard drive.

## Security of your personal data
