This document will let you know what information we collect from Lunarpages users and how we use that information. This document will let you know what choices you have concerning your personal information and inform you how to make them.

#### Collection and Use of Information

Lunarpages collects information from customers who sign up for Web Hosting Services, Domain Name Registration, Affiliate Accounts, Web Hosting Resale Accounts and other such services. This information includes but may not be limited to name, address, telephone number, email address, billing information, URL information and other data relating to the sale, use and billing of such services. This information is used for the registration and management of your account. It may also be used to contact you for purposes of collecting any outstanding balance on your account.

Lunarpages may use this information internally to provide the services that you have requested and facilitate customer communications, domain registration services, web hosting services and billing and collection activities associated therewith. Lunarpages may from time to time also communicate with you on behalf of our marketing partners. Lunarpages will also in some instances share your personally identifiable information with our approved marketing partners for marketing purposes related to specific special offers that we believe you would like to receive based upon the services that you express an interest in from us. We require all marketing partners to comply with the Federal CAN-SPAM Act and all other applicable laws. We require that each such marketing partner provide a conspicuous opt-out link for your use to remove your information from their email list. Furthermore, if you wish us not to share your email address or other personally identifiable information you may contact us by email at [support@lunarpages.com](mailto:support@lunarpages.com).

#### Surveys or Contests

On occasion we provide hosting customers with the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).

If the contest or survey requires, permits or is otherwise related to the submission by you to us of any story, artwork, photograph or other such material this information and material may be used to select a winner and tabulate survey results. In addition, we may use any such submission pursuant to the relevant portion of our Terms of Service to display to other hosting customers or non-hosting customers whether or not in conjunction with information from our advertisers or partners.

#### Additional Information

In addition to the registration information set forth above, Lunarpages also records and tracks your IP address, and browser type for purposes of security, maintaining the web site and ensuring the best possible user experience. This non-personally identifiable information is also tabulated and aggregated for statistical purposes of determining broad demographic usage information and on occasion is shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to hosting customers. We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.

Information that you may choose to post on the Service including any text entries, photos, videos or other content are displayed to other hosting customers and, at times, are available to unregistered web site visitors. Your full name, address, telephone number, or email address are never provided to other hosting customers or web site visitors by Lunarpages.
