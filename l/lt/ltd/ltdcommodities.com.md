##  Privacy Policy

LTD Commodities LLC holds the privacy and security of our customers in the highest regard. The following data explains what kind of information is gathered on the LTD Commodities website and how the information is used.

LTD Commodities LLC will treat your email address as confidential information; we will not rent, sell or trade the contents of our email list to any outside parties.

**Does LTD Commodities offer secure online ordering?**

Yes, we do. All customer and order information is securely stored behind a firewall and protected from unauthorized access. Your online session is encrypted using SSL with a certificate provided by Verisign. Therefore, none of your personal information, including credit card number, name and address, can be read as the information travels over the internet. Your credit card number is protected by our encryption methods as soon as we capture it and before it is stored in our database to protect it from potential theft. LTD Commodities does not store your CVV2 credit card security code anywhere on its system.

**What do you do with my email address?**

LTD Commodities LLC collects your email address as part of your registration with us. We use this address to communicate with you about your account. We do not sell your email address to others.

**What kind of information do you collect from me when I visit your web site?**

We do not collect any personally identifiable information from those merely visiting our site. We do ask for additional information if you would like to place an order, request an order status or a free catalog, or if you need to communicate with us regarding an account issue.

**What are 'cookies' and how do you use them?**

"Cookies" are files that are stored on your device's hard drive by your web browser and are used to improve your online experience. Cookies help us identify account holders and optimize their shopping experience by allowing functions such as online shopping carts.

However, if you choose not to accept cookies, we may not be able to provide you with as good of an experience as one that is specifically tailored to your needs by utilizing the cookie.

We may also use technologies, such as our own cookies, to provide you with personalized online display advertising tailored to your interests.

The information you provided on the website is used to fulfill a product order, a catalog request or research a customer inquiry. The information that you provide is stored in-house separate from the Internet.

We do occasionally share name and address information with other catalog companies that offer similar products. We will not share any personal financial information. If you are on our catalog mailing list, or order from one of our catalogs, and would prefer not to have your name shared with other catalog companies, please email at **MarketingDepartment@ltdcommodities.com** and ask that your name not be shared.
