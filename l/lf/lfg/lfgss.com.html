We control how your personal information is used.</p>
<p>We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This privacy policy sets out how we collect, use and share information that identifies you or is associated with you ("<strong>personal information</strong>") when you use our forum.</p>
<p>By setting up an account with us or using and accessing the forum, you consent to the use of your personal information as described in this privacy policy.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that we use cookies to store and access information whilst providing the forum. You can find out more about our use of cookies in our cookies policy <a href="https://www.lfgss.com/legal/cookies">https://www.lfgss.com/legal/cookies</a>.</p>
<h3>Personal information we hold about you</h3>
<p>We collect personal information from you when you voluntarily submit information directly to us or the forum.
