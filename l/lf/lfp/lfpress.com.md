**London Free Press Privacy Statement**

The London Free Press respects the privacy of its subscribers, readers and those who enter our contests and promotions. As part of our commitment to you, we want to clarify why we may ask for your personal information (such as your name, address and phone number). 

If you are a subscriber or advertiser, we collect personal information in order to set up an account, verify creditworthiness, to maintain a satisfactory relationship and to provide you with ongoing service. For example, we collect information that allows us to process your subscription, confirm your identity and address so we can accurately deliver your newspaper or print your advertisement and accurately bill and collect. We may collect credit card or bank account information if you prefer the convenience of pre-authorized payment or we require pre-payment. We or another company acting with our authority may contact you to conduct surveys or determine your preferences in order to better serve you and provide you with the newspaper content or other products or services that you may wish to receive. We may share your personal information with our affiliate businesses or with selected third parties who act on our behalf as our agents, suppliers or service providers. (We may also make our subscription list available to specific reputable businesses whose products or services may be of interest to you.)

If you enter a contest or participate in a promotion, we collect personal information to process your application and administer the contest. On occasion, we undertake contests or promotions with sponsors or we use third parties to assist us in administering a contest or promotion. In these cases we share your personal information with these sponsors or administrators in order that they can assist us in undertaking and administering the contest or promotion. In addition, if you enter a contest or participate in a promotion that involves or relates to specific products or activities we or our sponsors may send you material that relates to such products or activities. 

From time to time we may revise this privacy policy. To view our current privacy policy please log on to [www.lfpress.com](http://www.lfpress.com/) and click the privacy policy link.

We will honour any request you may make to have access to or review your personal information that we have obtained as referred to above.

If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy practices or you do not wish to allow us to use your personal information in any manner discussed above you may call 519-679-1111 or 1-800-265-4167 or contact us in writing at the following address:

|  |  LFPRESS.COM (LFP) is committed to upholding fundamental principles of honesty and integrity in our relationship with visitors to our website. Our objective is to build an enduring relationship between CANOE and our users based on a foundation of integrity and trust. 

To that end, LFP has adopted rigorous standards of privacy and makes the following promise to every visitor to our Web site: 

* When a visitor to LFP is required to submit registration information as a prerequisite for accessing any content area of LFP or to use any of its interactive services, contests or newsgroups, e-commerce applications, LFP will not share or sell that personal information about our users to any outside agency, advertiser or other third party unless the user was made aware of this possibility prior to submitting their personal information. 

* Although LFP will use "cookies" to track user patterns on its web site, LFP will not use cookies to learn the identity of its users, nor attempt to track users after they leave the LFP site. Further, cookies will not be used by LFP to gather specific personal information about individual users. The usage patterns tracked by individual cookies will remain confidential, and LFP will not participate in any external site tracking programs. Nor will we share any cookie-generated information about individual users or user patterns with outside agencies or advertisers. A LFP advertiser may be given summaries of collective user patterns. For example, an advertiser might be told their ad was viewed by 6,000 users on a particular day and 100 clicked on the ad. But an advertiser will never be given information about individual users or their browsing habits. 

* LFP will not send unsolicited e-mail to its users. Nor will the use of cookies by LFP result in an LFP user receiving unsolicited e-mail from LFP or its advertisers. LFP will not supply e-mail addresses to any third party without having obtained the consent of a user. 

* When LFP asks its users to supply optional, personal information for contests, survey, e-commerce applications, or for any other purpose, that information will remain private and not be shared with any outside agency, advertiser or third party unless the user was made aware of this possibility prior to submitting their personal information. 

* LFP will compile site-wide demographic information that it will share with advertisers, but it will not compile profiles of individual users, including the gathering of names, addresses, e-mail addresses and other personal information, to be shared with an advertiser unless the user has consented to the compilation of this material and submitted it freely in a registration form or survey. 

* LFP tracks user IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration, demographic profiling and traffic logging, but LFP will not use IP addresses to try to identify individual users of LFP. 

* LFP will abide by all court orders, valid search warrants and subpoenae.
