					<h1 class="mtcColor2">Personal privacy and protection of Member data</h1>
					<p class="mtcSpacing"><span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span> upholds the strictest of standards with respect to protection of privacy and of personal information, and has made a declaration to the French data protection authority (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés - CNIL), using number 796865 then 802516.<br><br>
				   Some information, comments or content (photographs or video) that the Member optionally provides may possibly, under the responsibility and on the initiative of the Member concerned, reveal the ethnic origin of the Member, his/her nationality, religion and/or sexual orientation. By providing such information, all optional, the Member concerned manifests his/her intention and, consequently, expressly consents to, and takes sole responsibility for, the processing of this mentioned "sensitive" data by <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span>, and freely takes the exclusive responsibility.<br><br>
				   Each Member can access or request access to information concerning him/her in order to have it modified, deleted or to forbid any use by <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span> of it. Such request access shall be exercised via postal mail to the following address: <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span> BP 109, 92106 BOULOGNE Cedex, France or by filing out the contact forms, and each Member shall carefully identify the senders personal identification.<br><br>
				   Each Member can, at the time of registration or at any time thereafter, request to receive and, subsequently, request without charge via <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span> to cease to receive, the <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span> newsletters and/or promotional offers sent to her/him by email or to cellular phone from <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span> and/or its partners. The rights and warranties of <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span> Members respect in particular the French law on "information technology and civil liberties", n° 78-17 dated 6 January 1978 as modified by Law n° 2004-801 dated 6 August 2004 transposing into French law the EU Directive 95/46/EC dated 24 October 1995 on the protection of personal data and privacy within the European Union; and the French law on "confidence in the digital economy", n° 2004-575 dated 21 June 2004 (article L 33-4-1, as modified, of the Post and Electronic Communications Code and the new article L. 121-20-5 of the Consumers Code) transposing into French law the EU Directive 2000/31/EC dated 8 June 2000 on electronic commerce and EU Directive 2002/58/EC dated 12 July 2002 on the protection of personal data and privacy in electronic communications.</p>
					
					<h2>5.1. When and why do we gather information about you?</h2>
					<p class="mtcSpacing">The Member is asked to supply information about himself/herself when he/she registers with the Service, participates in a contest, responds to a survey, participates in a chat or acquires a Pass. Certain items of information are mandatory in order to gain access to Services.</p>
					
					<h2>5.2. What sort of information do we gather?</h2>
					<p class="mtcSpacing">Personal information gathered by <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span> can include your name, postal and/or email address, fixed line and/or cellular phone number, bank information, information about your physical appearance, photographs, voice recording, video, personal values, religion, interests and your use of the Service.<br><br>
				   Furthermore, certain non-personal information are also gathered, such as the version of the Member's and any other visitor's web browser (Netscape, Internet Explorer, etc.), the operating system (Windows 98, Mac Os, etc.) and the IP address of the computer from which they are visiting.<br><br>
				   Finally, <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span> uses cookies, designed to store information used to identify the Member while he/she is browsing on the <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span> Internet site, in order to allow the Member to continue browsing without having to re-enter this information for each new page. The Member always has the option of preventing the use of cookies by modifying the options of his/her web browser. To obtain further information about this, please refer to the browser-specific advice on option modification, which is accessible on the "Your Traces" ("Vos Traces") section of the website of the French data protection authority (CNIL): <a class="mtcLink3D" href="http://www.cnil.fr" target="_blank">www.cnil.fr</a>.</p>
					
					<h2>5.3. Who has access to your information?</h2>
					<p>The information gathered about you when you register with <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span> and subscribe to our Services is used to offer you our different Services. All precautions have been taken on our databases to archive your information in a secure environment. Only a small number of our employees have access to your information, which is only accessible in case of necessity. The personal information you provide at the time of registration which does not comprise your personal ad and your profile will not be accessible by third parties, nor passed on, sold or exchanged, except in the cases named below and subject to your prior information and agreement, or in assumption of your non opposition hereto.<br><br>
				   We may send you promotional offers from some of our partners, subject to your explicit and informed consent given during registration, unless you oppose to it during your registration or at any moment thereafter. If you do not wish to recieve any special offers from <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span> or our partner companies let us know when you subscribe, or alternatively at any time through the area entitled "My Account" on the <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span> site, or by post.<br><br>
				   <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span> may occasionally share general socio-demographic information that does not include names with selected partners to allow them to target their announcements (by age category, gender, etc.). In this case, we will not send these partners any information that would allow them to identify you.<br><br>
				   The information contained in your personal ad, your search criteria and your profile can be accessed on <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span>, on the web, by email (newsletters), by cellular telephone or on <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span>'s Audiotel Service (a value-added telephone Service). In addition, these information may be broadcasted directly by <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span> or via our partners to persons interested in <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span>, through newsletters or third-party websites, or by all other electronic (email, SMS, etc.) or audiovisual (radio, television, etc.) communication tools, or by written press (newspapers, magazines, etc.), in order to increase your chances of meeting someone by promoting your person ads, search criteria and profile.<br><br>
				   Consequently, the Member explicitly authorizes <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span> to reproduce and broadcast the information contained in his/her personal ad, search criteria or profile (personal information, description, images, videos, etc.) on all or part of the <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span> Services (on the <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span> site, on the Web, by email, Audiotel) and/or in a general manner, on all distribution media, in particular audiovisual communication (press, radio, analogue television, digital television, cable or satellite) or electronic communication (email, Internet), throughout the entire world and for the length of time established in these Terms of Use between the Member and <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span>. Furthermore, the Member explicitly authorizes <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span> to transfer the benefits of the above mentioned rights to its partners and eventual successors of <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span>.<br><br>
				   If you no longer wish for <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span> or its partners to reproduce or broadcast the information comprised in your personal ad, your search criteria, or your profile, you can terminate your <span class="mtcCapitalize">Meetic</span> account following the conditions foreseen in the Article "Termination". Since this information is comprised of your personal ad, your search criteria and your profile, the termination will only take effect upon the next update or version of these communications (printed, press, audiovisual, or electronic) containing your personal ad, your search criteria and your profile information.</p>
