_The Leading Hotels of the World, Ltd. Privacy Policy_

Your privacy is very important to The Leading Hotels of the World, Ltd. The local entity in your jurisdiction, which can be found in the Contacts section below, is acting as data controller with respect to your personal information ("we" or "us"). With that in mind, we have established and implemented information-handling practices for www.lhw.com ("site") that we believe are consistent with the standards and practices of hospitality organizations doing business on the Internet. This privacy policy ("policy") describes the practices that apply to our site, including, specifically, the information we collect about you, when and how we collect and process that information. We have prepared a detailed policy so that you can make an informed decision about the extent you provide your information to our site. Please do not use our site if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy.

### Simply put:

  1. we will not collect personally identifiable information like your name, email, mailing address or telephone number ("Personal Information") in a manner inconsistent with this policy;
  2. we will not disclose your Personal Information to third parties except as described in this policy, or unless you have authorized us to do so in advance;
  3. we will allow you to view, correct or remove your Personal Information and other information that is accessible to you as part of your account as a registered user of the site; and
  4. we will take reasonable steps to protect the security of the Personal Information we collect from you. The remainder of this policy describes our information handling practices in detail.



### Purposes

We collect, process and use your Personal Information for purposes of providing the services requested by you from us, and in particular to register and manage your account, process your reservations, requests, and payments, and to communicate with you in connection with the above-listed purposes. Refusal to provide Personal Information for the above-mentioned purposes may affect our ability to fulfill contractual obligations or to provide you with services, information, and or material requested by you. With your consent, we may also use your Personal Information in order to provide you with advertising and promotional materials relating to us or other third parties using automatic means (such as e-mail or fax.), as well as paper mail and operator-assisted phone calls. Certain Personal Information that you have provided us may be given to the airline, car rental agency, hotel or property, travel package vendor or other involved third parties to fulfill your travel arrangements.

Such information in the guest profile may be used by us to automatically fill in certain forms that appear when you browse this site for information and reservations. When you browse, reserve or purchase travel services through this site, such information may be provided to the applicable vendors or other involved third parties to fulfill your travel arrangements.

**Other Information**

You may decide to share other information ("Other Information") with us about yourself (for example, demographic information like your age and gender) and your travel preferences and experiences.).

You may still use our site to search for and purchase travel services, even if you choose not to share this type of information with us.

**Opt-in and Opt-out**

As part of the registration process and reservation process, we allow you to choose whether you wish to receive advertisements, updates and promotions from us.

To do so, you must provide payment information to us - for example, your credit card specifics like card number, issuing bank, expiration date, cardholder name and billing address. If you have registered with us as part of our Leaders Club program, we will add this payment information to your traveler profile in order to fulfill future reservations.

### Sharing and Transfer of Personal Information

For the purposes described above, we may transfer and share your information, in compliance with applicable data privacy laws and on a need-to-know basis, with third parties including contractors, agents or data processors, some of whom may be located outside of your home jurisdiction, to enable such parties to provide services to us and to improve our service offerings to you. We will establish appropriate contract terms or other protections to appropriately safeguard such data. To ensure that all personal data transferred receive an adequate level of data protection within the meaning of the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC), the data processors have entered into contractual measures based on the European Commission model clauses or have taken other appropriate measures to address the adequacy requirement.

We may also use anonymous information supplied by you and other users during registration on our site with information about your use and others' use of our site. We will use this combined information to describe our user base, without reference to any specific individual, to potential partners, vendors, investors and advertisers. We will not share your Personal Information with any other users of our site, but we may use information we collect about your travel preferences and experiences to make recommendations to other users of our site. For example, if we know that you and other users of our site who have traveled to a particular destination had positive experiences at a hotel in that destination, we might recommend that hotel to others who will be traveling to that destination. We may also share aggregated statistical information about users of our site and our service and product offerings with others, including our vendors and partners. We will not link this statistical information to any Personal Information that can identify you as an individual.

**Storage of Personal Information**

The Personal Information you provide will be transferred and stored in a jurisdiction that may not provide an adequate level of protection to Personal Information equivalent to that provided by your home jurisdiction.

We have taken appropriate measures with our data processors to ensure that all personal data transferred receive an adequate level of data protection within the meaning of the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC).

In addition, we may share information with additional service providers as described below.

**Required Disclosures**

### Data Security

We maintain technical, electronic, and organizational security procedures to maintain the security of Personal Information, and safeguard Personal Information against unauthorized or unlawful processing and/or against accidental or unlawful loss, alteration, disclosure or access. Our security procedures include contractual terms with any contractors, agents or data processors that require such entities to protect the security and confidentiality of Personal Information in accordance with our standards.

It is your responsibility to safeguard any email or password that you have created or used in connection with this site, and to notify us if you ever suspect that the security and confidentiality of such email or password has been compromised in any way. You are solely responsible for any use of this site via your email and password.

### Retention of Personal Information

We will maintain Personal Information for as long as we are required to do so by applicable law(s), or for as long as necessary for the purpose(s) described above for which it is processed. We will delete Personal Information when it is no longer needed and, in any case, upon expiration of the maximum storage term set forth by applicable law.

### Notification of Changes

We may change this policy from time to time. If we decide to change this policy in a material way (for example, a change regarding disclosure of Personal Information), we will post notice of the change on our site and notify you via email at the address you have provided to us at least thirty (30) days before putting the change into effect. If we decide to change our policy in a less significant way, we will simply post notice of the change on our site at least thirty (30) days before putting the change into effect. Your continued use of our site after we make changes to this policy is deemed acceptance of those changes.
