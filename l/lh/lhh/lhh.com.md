# Privacy policy - Lee Hecht Harrison

LHH and its affiliates are committed to respecting the privacy of our website visitors, candidates and employees in accordance with applicable law. This Privacy Policy generally describes how we collect and process personal information, how we use such information and to whom it may be disclosed.  By submitting personal data, a visitor to our website is agreeing to our use of such data as described in this privacy statement.   In keeping with our policy, individual users of specific services and online tools may receive additional notice about specific uses of their information in connection with those services and tools.

LHH abides by the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework established by the U.S. Department of Commerce (together the “Safe Harbor”) regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.  In that regard, we have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.  To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification, please visit [**http://www.export.gov/safeharbor**](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor).

**HOW WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION  
**  
We use information provided to us in order to foster a positive website experience, to provide services that we offer (including delivering reports and billing to our client companies about these services), to develop sales opportunities, and to deliver benefits and other programs to our employees.   If you have posted a resume on our online tools, this may include using and sharing information from your resume.    From time to time we may also use contact details that you provide to us in order to send news and information about products, services and events offered by LHH, LHH affiliates, and our carefully selected third party commercial partners who provide services in connection with ours, which may be of interest to you.  These communications may be sent by fax, email, SMS and other electronic means via the contact details you have supplied.  Please note that we will only do his with your explicit consent and you can unsubscribe from receiving direct marketing communications at any time in the future by contacting us at the email address in the DELETE/UNSUBSCRIBE section below or using the unsubscribe facility provided on a relevant communication.

**TRANSFER OF INFORMATION  
**  
We use your information internally, with other LHH subsidiaries and affiliates, but we do not disclose personal information to third parties, except that:

Additionally, like most international businesses, we have centralized certain aspects of our data processing activities in accordance with applicable laws, which in many instances will result in the transfer of your personal information from one country to another. If you live or are based in the European Economic Area (EEA), this will include transfer of your personal information from the EEA to the United States.  The United States and other jurisdictions where that information will be processed have laws that may not be regarded as providing a level of legal protection for personal information that is regarded as adequate by standards applied in the EEA. Nevertheless, whenever your personal information is transferred between LHH and LHH affiliates, your personal information will be processed in accordance with the standards contained in this Privacy Policy.

**PASSIVE INFORMATION COLLECTION**

We use "cookies" to enable our online tools to interact with the web browser software on your computer or mobile device, so as to provide you with better service and a more effective experience. 

"Cookies" are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies are used to maintain session information between your browser and our online tools, and are required for some of our online tools to operate.  Our online tools can later retrieve these cookies if you visit our website again.

You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most website browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and allow you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. If you elect to decline cookies, please note that this may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on our website or in your use of our online tools.

We may also gather your IP address to help diagnose problems with our services, to administer our websites, and to gather broad demographic information. IP addresses will be held for seven days only or subject to such time limits as required under applicable law.  Demographic information is gathered in aggregate only and cannot be traced to an individual user.

**USER FEEDBACK  
**  
We welcome ideas and feedback from users about all aspects of our services or websites. We store feedback that you send to us. This feedback is used to administer and refine our services, and, at times, may be shared with our partners either in aggregate form or with specific identifying characteristics (e.g., e-mail address, name) removed. We may also use the information and ideas you send us to improve or promote our services and websites, but we will not publish your name in association with any information provided without contacting you and gaining your permission.

**CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION  
**  
If you participate in our services or are an employee, access to online services that we provide and personal information is provided by use of your username, password and other log-in details that we may supply or which you may create from time to time (“Log-in Details”). You are responsible for ensuring the privacy and security of these Log-in Details and must not share them with anyone else. You also may choose to send or store personal information with one of our representatives. This could include job applications sent directly via e-mail to us, or making your resume available for searching by authorized parties.  

If an individual contacts us with a request for assistance in using website features or to report an error, our authorized staff may access user registration details solely in order to diagnose the problem and identify solutions.

**YOUR RIGHTS TO ACCESS PERSONAL DATA  
**  
We provide individuals with rights to access and update personal information held about them.  Any individual who wishes to inquire about any personal information we may have can do so by contacting us (see CONTACTING US section).  In most cases, you have the right to request that we correct, or stop processing personal information that we hold about you, subject to applicable legal requirements, by contacting us at the address provided below in the CONTACTING US section.   We reserve the right to ask for documentary evidence to verify your identity before we can deal with any request. Where legally permitted we may also charge a small administration fee for complying with any request.

**DELETE/UNSUBSCRIBE INFORMATION  
**  
Users can unsubscribe at any time, by following the instructions on the particular online tool, or in e-mail sent to [**support@lhh.com**](mailto:support@lhh.com).

To the maximum extent legally permitted, we cannot be responsible for unsubscribing you from third-party mailing lists where this is beyond our reasonable control or would involve a disproportionate effort.

**HOW SECURE IS YOUR INFORMATION?** We have implemented appropriate measures to keep the servers on which your information is stored secure and free from unauthorized access and use, by enforcing physical security at the premises in which the servers are located, and by using industry standard technological measures, including firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems, secured servers and database security, to prevent unauthorized remote access to the server.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Despite our best efforts to keep transmissions to and from our server secure, we are unable to absolutely guarantee security over the Internet and there will always be a risk of unauthorized access to information that you transmit to us. 

Where Log-in Details are required to access any online tools and your personal information, you must keep these private and secure at all times and must not share them with anyone else.  To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law and subject to us taking the security measures referred to above, we cannot be responsible for any loss, damage or expense (whether direct or indirect) arising from unauthorized access to or use of personal information due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control, or to the extent any user fails to back-up personal information or does not observe reasonable security requirements such as protecting passwords.

**COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY THIRD-PARTY SITES  
**  
This website contains links to third party owned websites whose information practices may be different from ours. You should consult these third party websites' privacy notices before you provide any personal data to them, as we have no control over these third parties and how they may use your information.

The posting or distribution of registered user resumes may require the display to others of personally identifiable information contained in the resumes, which may result in registered users receiving unsolicited messages from third parties over whom we have no control.
