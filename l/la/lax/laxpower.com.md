Our Sites include online communities for people who want to discover, participate in, and share activities about which they are passionate. 

The information we collect from you allows you to log into our Sites, use our Services and Applications, and register for and/or set up registration for you or your organization’s own customers for events, contests, camps, licenses, classes, tickets, facility/equipment use, transactions, sales, memberships, reservations, donations, and/or activities (collectively, **“Events”** ). 

We also collect information from businesses, organizations, and individuals who request information from ACTIVE.

Individuals (and agents of individuals) may provide us information directly or indirectly by registering for an Event or by otherwise using our Services (these individuals are referred to as **“Consumers”** ). For example, you may enter your information in order to register for an Event, or someone who has organized a team may enter your information on your behalf to register your entire team.

Relatedly, our Clients (including agents of our Clients) may provide us personal information about individuals who have registered for an Event being operated by our Client or who the Client wants us to contact or otherwise provide Services to on behalf of the Client.

  * If you are using our Services to register for an Event or to purchase a third party product or service (for example, one of our Clients who is an Event organizer), ACTIVE shares the personal information that you provide with the applicable third party in order to fulfill your request. You may also receive communications, correspondence, emails, or direct mail from such third party. Each such party operates independently from ACTIVE and, as we explained earlier, their collection of your personal information is not subject to this Policy but is subject to their own privacy notice.

**TRANSFERRING PERSONAL INFORMATION GLOBALLY**

**International data transfer**

We operate on a global basis. This means that your personal information may be transferred to and stored in the United States, which may be subject to different standards of data protection than your country of residence. 

We will take appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of personal information are in accordance with applicable law, are carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and interests and limited to countries which are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where alternative adequate arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights. To this end:

  * we ensure transfers within ACTIVE will be covered by an agreement entered into by ACTIVE entities (an intra group agreement) which contractually obliges each such entity to ensure that personal information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within ACTIVE;
  * where we transfer your personal information outside ACTIVE or to third parties who help provide our Services, we obtain contractual commitments from them to protect your personal information; or
  * where we receive requests for information from law enforcement or regulators, we carefully validate these requests before any personal information are disclosed.



You have a right to contact us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place (including a copy of relevant contractual commitments) to ensure the adequate protection of your personal information when this is transferred as mentioned above. 

**EU Transfer Mechanism**

ACTIVE participates in, and has certified its compliance with, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. ACTIVE is committed to subjecting all personal information received from European Union (EU) member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit [ www.privacyshield.gov.](https://www.privacyshield.gov/)

ACTIVE is responsible for the processing of personal information it receives under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequent transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. ACTIVE complies with the Privacy Shield principles for all onward transfers of personal information from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, ACTIVE is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, ACTIVE may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

**HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION**

**Security**

We have implemented and maintain appropriate technical and organisational security measures, policies and procedures designed to reduce the risk of accidental destruction, or loss, or unauthorised disclosure or access to such information appropriate to the nature of the information concerned, including:

  * (where appropriate) password protection, encryption, and use of secure communication transmission software (known as "secure socket layering" or "SSL") to protect our Sites; 
  * placing confidentiality requirements on our employees and service providers;
  * destroying or permanently anonymising personal information if it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected; and
  * following strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of your personal information to prevent unauthorised access to it. Whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard your personal information, no transmission over the Internet can ever be guaranteed to be secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information that you transfer over the Internet to us and any such transmission is at your own risk. 

As the security of personal information depends in part on the security of the computer you use to communicate with us and the security you use to protect usernames and passwords, you should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, computer, and web-enabled devices, among other things, by signing off after using a shared computer, inserting a password on your web-enabled device, choosing a password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, keeping your password private, and periodically changing your password. You should never share your log-in information with others. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity. 

**Storing your personal information**

We will store your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, as explained in this Policy. Where your information is no longer needed, we will ensure that it is disposed of in a secure manner. In some circumstances we may store your personal information for longer periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax, accounting requirements. 

In specific circumstances we may store your personal information for longer periods of time so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your personal information or dealings.

**EXPLAINING MORE ABOUT DIRECT MARKETING**

**How we use personal information you keep you up to date with our Services**

We may use personal information to let you know about our Services that we believe will be of interest to you. We may contact you by email, post, or telephone or through other communications channels that we think you may find helpful. In all cases, we will respect your preferences for how you would like us to manage marketing activities with you. 

We also work with carefully selected third parties, such as promotional partners and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships. At all times, in accordance with your marketing preferences, these third parties may contact you by email, SMS/text, social media or through other communications channels to tell you about products and services that they believe would be of interest to you. 

**How you can manage your marketing preferences**

To protect privacy rights and to ensure you have control over how we manage marketing with you:

    * We will take steps to limit direct marketing to a reasonable and proportionate level and only send you communications which we believe may be of interest or relevance to you;
    * At any time you can update or correct your personal profile, or change your preferences for the way in which you would like us to communication with you, including how you receive details of latest offers from us;

    * You can change the way your browser manages cookies, which may be used to deliver online advertising, by following the settings on your browser.

We recommend you routinely review the privacy notices and preference settings that are available to you on any social media platforms as well as your preferences in your account with us. Further, if (in accordance with your marketing preferences) you receive marketing from the third parties referred to above, we recommend you review any relevant third party's privacy notice for how they use your personal information.

We may not always be able to fully address your request, for example if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if we are legally entitled to deal with the request in a different way. 

**Right to access personal information**

You have a right to request that we provide you with a copy of your personal information that we hold and you have the right to be informed of (a) the source of your personal information; (b) the purposes, legal basis and methods of processing; (c) the data controller’s identity; and (d) the entities or categories of entities to whom your personal information may be transferred. You can exercise this right by completing the form located at <http://www.active.com/claim>

**Right to rectify or erase personal information**

You have a right to request that we rectify inaccurate personal information. We may seek to verify the accuracy of the personal information before rectifying it.

You can also request that we erase your personal information in limited circumstances where:

    * it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected; or
    * you have withdrawn your consent (where the data processing was based on consent); or
    * following a successful right to object (see right to object); or
    * it has been processed unlawfully; or
    * to comply with a legal obligation to which ACTIVE is subject.

You can exercise these rights by completing the form located at [http://www.active.com/claim.](http://www.active.com/claim)

We are not required to comply with your request to erase personal information if the processing of your personal information is necessary:

    * for compliance with a legal obligation; or
    * for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

**Right to restrict the processing of your personal information**

You can ask us to restrict your personal information, but only where:

    * its accuracy is contested, to allow us to verify its accuracy; or
    * the processing is unlawful, but you do not want it erased; or
    * it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected, but we still need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
    * you have exercised the right to object, and verification of overriding grounds is pending.

We can continue to use your personal information following a request for restriction, where:

    * we have your consent; or
    * to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
    * to protect the rights of another natural or legal person. 

**Right to transfer your personal information**

You can ask us to provide your personal information to you in a structured, commonly used, machine readable format, or you can ask to have it transferred directly to another data controller, but in each case only where:

    * the processing is based on your consent or on the performance of a contract with you; and
    * the processing is carried out by automated means. 

**Right to object to the processing of your personal information**

You can object to any processing of your personal information which has our legitimate interests as its legal basis if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests.

If you raise an objection, we have an opportunity to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests which override your rights and freedoms. 

**Right to object to how we use your personal information for direct marketing purposes**

You can request that we change the manner in which we contact you for marketing purposes.

You can request that we not transfer your personal information to unaffiliated third parties for the purposes of direct marketing or any other purposes.

You can ask to obtain a copy of, or reference to, the safeguards under which your personal information is transferred outside of the European Union. 

We may redact data transfer agreements to protect commercial terms.

We ask that you please attempt to resolve any issues with us first, although you have a right to contact your supervisory authority at any time.
