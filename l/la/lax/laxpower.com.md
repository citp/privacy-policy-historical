# LaxPower Privacy Policy

**What This Privacy Policy Covers**

This policy covers how LaxPower treats personal information LaxPower collects and receives. This policy does not apply to practices of companies that LaxPower does not control or to people that LaxPower does not manage.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

LaxPower does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other companies or parties. However, the identity (e-mail address) of those members of LaxPower’s forums who violate our policies are subject to dissemination to the appropriate individuals (or authorities) who may be injured by false or malicious information that is posted.

**Cookies**

LaxPower may set and access cookies on your computer. LaxPower lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies’ use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to LaxPower cookies.

**Confidentiality and Security**

We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we reasonably believe need to come into contact with that information in order to provide products or services to you.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

LaxPower may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by publishing it on the main page of our site.

**E-Mail**

If you elect to register on our forum(s) or have submitted scores or other information with your e-mail address attached, we may save it so that we can contact you if necessary about issues or questions that may arise. If you do not wish to receive these e-mails, you can simply advise us, and we will delete your name from our registration and/or remove you from our scores submission list.

**Forums**

Any information you disclose when posting a message becomes public. Your e-mail address is hidden unless you elect to disclose it at the time of posting. We do not share this address with anyone unless you have libeled someone or violated a law.

**Advertising Sales Specific Terms and Conditions**

We use third-party advertising companies to serve our ads on our web site. These companies have their own privacy policies, which we have no control over.

**Privacy Policy for Children under 13**

LaxPower is a family oriented site and contains content which we deem suitable for all members of the family. However, the forums are open to many members, and posts can be in violation of our forum policy. We make our best efforts to delete offensive posts but cannot always do so in a timely fashion. On the other hand, we cannot censure posts simply because they could be construed as inappropriate to children. Therefore, parents should evaluate the forums and decide whether to permit children to visit.

**Links**

Our web site contains links to numerous other sites. LaxPower is not responsible for the content or privacy practice of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each web site to which we may link that may collect personally identifiable data.
