# Privacy Policy | US Lacrosse Magazine

US Lacrosse, Inc. (“USL,” “we”, “us” or “our”) owns and operates this website (this “Site”).  USL is concerned about your privacy and the confidentiality of information you share with us. This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes how we collect, use, share, store, and protect your information.

### SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY

This Privacy Policy applies to activities of USL and to persons who visit the Site, sign up for USL publications and mailings, or otherwise transact with USL, and covers our collection, use, storage and sharing of personal and non-personal information.

“Personal information” is any information that can be used to identify you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us. 

“Non-personal information” includes information that is collected passively or automatically from you, such as information collected from your browser or device through the use of cookies and other similar technologies. 

We consider Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and other similar identifiers to be non-personal information unless we are required to treat such information as personal information under applicable law. If non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.

### YOUR CONSENT

By accessing or using this Site and/or providing any personal information to us, you accept and consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not accept these practices, you must not access or use the Site or provide us with your personal information.

### INFORMATION WE COLLECT

You do not have to provide any personal information to read the content of our Site. You will, however,  provide personal information when you use the Site to submit a donation, sign up to attend an event, register for a clinic, apply to become a member, create a USL account, make a purchase, or contact us for more information. Some examples of personal information we collect include: your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and phone number. When you make a purchase or donation, or you sign up for an event, we ask for your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and credit card information, including the card type, number, security code and expiration date. Credit card payment processing is handled by a third party and is subject to the third party’s privacy policy. USL does not store credit card information provided to the third party for credit card payment processing.

### HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

We use your personal information for our internal business operations such as to process your donation, provide our programs and services or respond to your request for information. We may also use the information to contact you if there is a problem with your donation, for feedback on our services or for marketing purposes. For example, you may receive periodic e-mails, direct mailings, or telephone calls from us with information on our upcoming events.  We also use your information for any other purpose identified in any other agreement between you and us.

If you do not wish to receive such mailings or calls, please send an e-mail to the address below or click “unsubscribe” in an e-mail that you receive from us.

### CHILD PRIVACY

We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13, and we require information regarding children under 13 to be provided by parents or guardians. Please contact us at [info@uslacrosse.org](mailto:info@uslacrosse.org) if you suspect that we have collected information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected information of a child under 13 without consent, we will take steps to delete the information as quickly as possible.

### TECHNOLOGY WE USE TO COLLECT INFORMATION

In addition to information that you manually provided to us by using, for example, your keyboard, mouse, or touchpad, this Site uses cookies and other similar technologies to collect information for the purposes explained below.

            _COOKIES_

Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information that are placed on your device’s browser and used to recognize your browser in the future and to track your interaction with the Site. Cookies are stored on your device or in local storage. Cookies are useful. They make using the internet easier by, among other things, saving your passwords and preferences for you. Some cookies (“session” cookies) expire and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Others (“persistent” cookies), do not expire and are not automatically deleted.

You can enable your browser to refuse cookies.  If you do, certain features of the Site may not work as intended or may be slowed. For information on configuring your browser to decline cookies, check your browser’s “help” feature.

We may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to track and analyze Site usage and browsing activity, to make your visit to the Site easier by recognizing you when you return, and for other purposes set forth in any agreement between you and USL. We may also use web beacons, clear gif technology, action tags, or other technologies to track how users navigate to and through the Site. We may also use this technology to track the delivery of HTML e-mail messages.

Web beacons cannot be declined when delivered using a regular web page, but they can be refused when delivered by e-mail. If you do not wish to receive web beacons by e-mail, you will need to disable HTML images or select text only for e-mails received with your e-mail software.

            _DO-NOT-TRACK SIGNALS_

Some web browsers may transmit “do–not-track” signals to the Site. There is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals. We therefore do not currently take action in response to these signals. We may update this Privacy Policy if and when a standard for responding to these signals is established.

_             OTHER METHODS_

We may also track activity on our Site using log files stored on our servers, and collect information, including IP addresses, browser types and versions, geographic information, pages viewed and devices used to interact with the Site. We may use this information to personalize your experience and to administer our Site.

We may use a web analytics service, such as Google Analytics, to record and analyze your activity on this Site. The Site or any such service may track your browsing across web sites that use the same service and may collect information about you such as the type of computer or operating system you are using, your location (e.g., city, state, country), and gender.

This Site may interact with social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube Google+, Pinterest, Tumblr, Reddit, and LinkedIn.  The Site may include social media features such as the Facebook “like” button, widgets, or interactive mini-programs that run on our Site. These features, and the third-parties who offer them, may collect your IP address, browsing information, and may set cookies to enable the feature to function properly. In addition to this Privacy Policy, your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the party providing the feature. 

You may be able to register with or log on to the Site by choosing to automatically populate the requested data fields with information you previously provided to a third-party (such as Facebook, Twitter or Google). By doing this, you are asking the third-party platform to send us information, including personal information, from your profile on that platform. We treat that information as we do any other information you give to us when you register, log on, or enhance your profile.

### HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, we do not knowingly sell, share, or rent your information to any third parties without your permission. We may share your information, including your personal information, with our employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, such as Chapters, for the purpose of carrying out general USL business operations. For example, we use third party services to assist us in securely processing your credit card transactions and may share information with Chapters or third party service providers for the purpose of verifying USL membership. We may also share personal information and non-personal information with third parties that help manage and maintain this Site and databases and who assist us with event registration, direct mailing, e-mail communications, and other business operations.

We strive to ensure that any parties with which we share your information will provide at least the same level of protection as this Privacy Policy offers. We are not, however, responsible for the privacy practices of third parties and do not guarantee that they have similar privacy practices.

We will share information with courts, law enforcement and other governmental agencies, and with third parties when required by law to do so, or when we in good faith believe it is necessary in order to comply with legal obligations. In the event that this Site, or all or substantially all of our assets are acquired, merged, or reorganized, user information may be transferred to another party.

USL shares with its sponsors and third-party services providers the names, e-mail addresses, and mailing addresses of members for their own marketing purposes and for the purpose of providing exclusive promotional offers to USL members. You may request that USL not provide your information to third parties for their marketing purposes by sending a written request to the mailing address below or to [info@uslacrosse.org](mailto:info@uslacrosse.org).

### PRIVACY POLICIES OF LINKED SITES AND THIRD PARTIES

The Site uses third parties to process credit card transactions, and the Site also contains links to other sites. This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Although you may link to other sites or third parties via the Site, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties or the content of linked sites.

### SECURITY OF INFORMATION

We have in place reasonable procedures designed to help prevent unauthorized access and to maintain information and data security. Although we take reasonable precautions, we cannot guarantee the security of information provided over the internet or that we store, and we will not be responsible for breaches of security beyond our reasonable control. 

### WHO MAY SEE THE INFORMATION I POST TO VARIOUS AREAS OF THE SITE?

If you provide information that is published or displayed on the USL Blog or other public areas of the Site, or is transmitted to other users of the Site or third parties (collectively, “User Contributions”), you are solely responsible for your User Contributions and their attendant consequences, and you provide User Contributions and transmit them to others at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users of the Site with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. We therefore cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. Nor do we make any warranties with regards to the information transmitted through User Contributions.

### HOW YOU CAN ACCESS AND CORRECT YOUR INFORMATION

You may view, correct or update the personal information we have about you by sending a request to the e-mail or mailing address listed below. Individuals with a USL account may correct or update the personal information within the USL system by logging into their account. Others who may want to correct or update their personal information may do so by contacting us using the contact information below. If we use any of your personal information in a manner that you believe is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, please contact us so that we may correct such inconsistency. To change your date of birth you must contact member services by phone at 410-235-6882, extension 102.

### AMENDMENTS TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

From time to time, we may make changes to our information practices or alter the functionality of the Site. If we change this Privacy Policy, we will post a notice of those changes on our home page so our users are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. When we update this Privacy Policy, we will change the “last updated” date below. We encourage you to periodically review this page and the Site’s home page for the latest information on our privacy practices for this Site.

### STORAGE OF INFORMATION

Information that we collect is processed and stored in the U.S. If you reside outside of the U.S. and provide information to us, you consent to the transfer, processing, and storage of your information in the U.S.
