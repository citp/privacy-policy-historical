We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy before using the Sites. Your use of the Sites signifies that you agree with all of the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, so please do not use the Sites if you disagree with any part of this Privacy Policy.

**1\. What are Webscale’s practices regarding the collection and use of information?**

We may maintain a record of the purchases you make with us.

(ii) We may use your personally identifiable information in the following ways:

  * To communicate with you and to send you information by mail, email, telephone or other means about our products, services, promotions and the like;

  * To analyze trends and statistics;
  * To protect the security or integrity of the Sites and our business;
  * To contact you if necessary.



(b) Cookies: The Sites use “cookies,” which are small data files that are stored on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies enable you to use or shop on the Sites and may be used in a variety of ways to enhance or personalize your online experience. For example, we may use cookies to enable you to use certain features of the Sites, store your preferences, recognize you when you return to the Sites, track your orders, and monitor and maintain information about your use of the Sites. Cookies also may be used to collect transaction information for promotions conducted on the Sites. Cookies do not cause damage to your computer system or files, and only the website that transferred a particular cookie to you can read, modify or delete such cookie. You can set your browser not to accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it. If you do not accept cookies, however, you will not be able to access your account information or make purchases on or similarly use the Sites.

(c) Pixel Tags:

(i) We use “pixel tags” (also called “web beacons” or “clear gifs”), which are tiny graphic images, on the Sites and in our emails. Pixel tags help us analyze our customers’ online behavior and measure the effectiveness of the Sites. We work with service providers that help us track, collect, and analyze this information.

(ii) Pixel tags on the Sites may be used to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the Sites. This information may include your computer’s Internet protocol (IP) address, your browser type, your operating system, date and time information and other technical information about your computer. We may also track certain information about the identity of the website you visited immediately before coming to the Sites. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other websites.

(iii) Pixel tags and cookies in our emails may be used to track your interactions with those messages, such as when you receive, open, or click a link in an email from us.

(iv) We also work with third-party companies that use tracking technologies to serve information on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your visits to the Sites and your interaction with our information and other communications.

(d) Other Information: As you interact with us, certain information may be collected passively, such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, or the MAC address of a wireless device that you may be using to access the Sites. This helps us identify you and provide better service to you. An “Internet protocol address” or “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. The “MAC Address” or “Media Access Control Address” is an identifier attached to a network adapter, such as your wireless (Wi-Fi) card, device or component.

Additionally, we may share such personally identifiable information with our subsidiaries and affiliates (“Affiliated Entities”) and selected third parties (“Promotional Partners”) as follows:

(i) Affiliated Entities: We may share your personally identifiable information with Affiliated Entities for the uses set forth in Section 1(a) above.

Webscale also may provide your personally identifiable information to Promotional Partners when we team up with them to offer or provide products, services or other promotions. When selecting Promotional Partners, Webscale chooses only reputable companies that offer high-quality products and services. When you respond to any offers of, purchase the products or services from or participate in any other promotion sponsored by any Promotional Partner, any information that you provide to such Promotional Partner will be subject to such Promotional Partner’s privacy practices.

(iii) Service Providers: We may share your personally identifiable information with service providers who manage our customer information and perform services on our behalf, such as analyzing certain personal and non-personal information to allow us to better provide products and services to you, sending communications and conducting surveys. We do not authorize any of these service providers to make any other use or disclosure of your information.

**3\. Ad Networks**

Our third-party ad networks use technology that allows advertisements and links to appear on other websites in your browser. In some cases they automatically receive your IP address when this occurs. Other technologies (such as cookies, pixel tags and JavaScript) may also be used by the third-party ad networks to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and/or to personalize the advertising content that you see.

Webscale has no access to or control over these cookies that are used by third-party advertisers; however we do not advertise directly on the Sites.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers for more detailed information on their practices as well as for instructions about how to opt-out of certain practices. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or websites.

If you wish to disable cookies, you may do so through your individual browser options. More detailed information about cookie management with specific web browsers can be found at the browsers’ respective websites.

**4\. Online Advertising We Use**

Webscale also uses third-party vendor re-marketing tracking cookies, including the Google Adwords tracking cookie. This means that we will continue to show ads to you across the Internet. As always we respect your privacy and are not collecting any personally identifiable information through the use of Google’s or any other third-party remarketing system. This allows us to make special offers and continue to market our services to those who have shown interest in our service.

**11\. How do I know that my personally identifiable information is secure?**

(a) We have in place certain physical, electronic, contractual, and managerial safeguards to protect the security and privacy of your personally identifiable information. No company can fully eliminate security risks connected to handling information on the Internet. You should know that unauthorized persons might attempt to intercept your network communications. We encourage you to exercise caution in accessing Wi-Fi hotspots and other communications networks.

(b) When you enter your personally identifiable information on the Sites, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your information as it is transmitted to us. To make sure that you are accessing our secure server before you submit personally identifiable financial information, look at your browser’s security level indicator to the right of the address bar or lower right corner of the window. If you see a solid key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the URL or Location line of your browser. If you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the address in that line should change from “http” to “https.”

**12\. What about links to other websites?**

For your convenience and information, the Sites may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the content or practices of any linked website. Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites, and we recommend that you review the privacy policy of any website that you access through the Sites.
