analyse some problem with the server. In such cases the relevant log file
may be kept longer, but will be deleted after being used.

other than what is accessible publicly through the public user interface.

linked to any other personal information. We will be none the wiser.

be downloaded to other servers beyond our control (such as mailing list
archives).

in case of bugreports.
