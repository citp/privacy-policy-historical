# Terms and Conditions - Lazy Man and Money

### Quick Non-Legalese Version

The stuff in the full legalese version below is standard boilerplate stuff. Some other personal finance blogger wrote it around 2007 or so and gave me permission to use it with some minor edits.

  * I have to tell you that I’m not a financial professional to protect myself legally. I could go out and get a bunch of licenses to give financial advice and I’ve thought about doing so, but then what I can write about would be legally restricted as well.
  * While I do give myself the ability to edit user comments, I’ve rarely used it… probably in less than 1 in a thousand cases. Typically it only happens when someone has a pretty good comment, but then ends with something like: “Here’s my [link to a get rich quick scheme].” I openly allow for any number of dissenting opinions (see [the comments on my MonaVie article](http://www.lazymanandmoney.com/monavie-scam/)), but in the end, I have to include this clause.
  * The advertising that I use, Google AdSense, and a number of other advertisers that I use are used by millions of sites. These advertisers require that I disclose that cookies can be used by these advertising systems. I do not get access to any of this information and can’t see any of your personal preferences, things you like, or sites you previously visited. I can get the general location of my visitors such as which country they live in, but with over 4 million visitors, chances are that every country is covered by now. You are essentially anonymous to me.
  * I will never ask for, and you should never tell me any a password of any kind.
  * If you leave a comment or subscribe to receive emails, I will never sell it. I hate spam as much as you do. In fact if you leave a comment with your email address as part of the text that another user can see, I edit your comment to take out the email address so nefarious spam bots scouring my site won’t pick up your email address.



That’s pretty much it. The overriding rule here is that I don’t collect much of your information myself and I make none of it available to others. You’ll find that the legalese below is essentially the same as millions of other websites and many personal finance blogs.
