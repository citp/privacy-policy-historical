# Lazarus wiki:Privacy policy - Lazarus wiki

The Free Pascal servers are located in the EU, and so are most of the core contributors to Free Pascal. This means we are subject to the stipulations of the [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) (General Data Protection Regulation -> [Official Text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG)), which requires us to inform you about our privacy policy, and about which data we collect about you. 

## What data do we collect about you?

The only personal data we collect and store are: 

  * a name (which can be a nickname for this specific use) 
  * an email address 



There are 4 possible locations where we ask for a name and an email address: 

  * The bug tracker 
  * The WIKI. 
  * The forum. 
  * The mailing lists. 



This information is stored in the respective databases that underly these information systems. This information is kept for an indeterminate period of time, as they are needed for the functioning of these communication systems. 

The web server's log files of these systems contain the IP address from all requests. Occasionally they also contain a name or email address. The log files are deleted after 2 days unless we need to analyse some problem with the server. In such cases, the relevant log file may be kept longer but will be deleted after being used. 

The collected data is not communicated or sold to other parties in any way, other than what is accessible publicly through the public user interface. 

You are free to use an alias and a special email address that cannot be linked to any other personal information. We will be none the wiser. 

Note that because some information is displayed publicly, it can be therefore be downloaded to other servers beyond our control (such as mailing list archives). 

## For what is this data used?

The data is only used to be able to contact you through the public websites or by email in case of bug reports. 

## Where can you see this information?

All recorded information is publicly accessible when you log into one of these systems, you can consult therefore all information we have on the respective websites listed above. 

## What to do if you want to exercise your right to be forgotten?

Send a mail to **gdpr at freepascal.org** with the request. Please include the necessary information we need to find your data in your request: that includes username, email. We will get back to you when we process your request. 

## Use of cookies

The bug tracker, WIKI, and forum use cookies to maintain a session for your activities in the respective sites. They do not use third-party cookies, and the cookies needed to make the website work are not transmitted to other parties.
