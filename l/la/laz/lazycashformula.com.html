<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>





<p style="text-align: left;">We
have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our
firm and continuing commitment to the privacy of personal
information provided by those visiting and interacting with
this web site. We hold the privacy of your personal information
in the highest regard. The following discloses our information
gathering and dissemination practices for this
website.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">We recognizes the
importance of protecting your
privacy and our policy is
designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and
safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to
assist you in making informed decisions when using our site.
This policy will be continuously assessed against new
technologies, business practices and our customers'
needs.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">When you visit this web site you may
provide us with two types
of information: personal information you knowingly choose to
disclose that is collected on an individual basis and Web site
use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and
others browse our Web site.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">1.
Personal Information You Choose to
Provide</h2>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registration
Information</span><br>
When you
register for any of our products, services or newsletters you
will provide us information about yourself.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Email
Information
</span><br>
If you choose to correspond with us
through email, we may retain the content of your email messages
together with your email address and our responses. We provide
the same protections for these electronic communications that
we employ in the maintenance of information received by mail
and telephone.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">2. Web Site Use
Information
</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Similar to other commercial Web sites, our
Web site utilizes a
standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below,
"What Are Cookies?") and web server log files to collect
information about how our Web site is used. Information
gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the
date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our
Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after
our Web site.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">How Do We
Use the Information That You Provide to
Us?</span><br>
Broadly speaking, we
use personal information for purposes of administering our
business activities, providing the products and services you
requested, to monitor the use of
the service, our marketing and
promotional efforts and improve our
content and service offerings, and customize our site's
content, layout, services and for other lawful
purposes. These uses improve our
site and better tailor it to meet your
needs. </p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">Furthermore, such information may be
shared with
others on an aggregate basis. Personally identifiable
information or business information will not be shared with
parties except as required by law.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">Occasionally, we may also use the
information we
collect to notify you about important changes to our Website,
new services, and special offers we think you will find
valuable. You may notify us at any time if you do not wish to
receive these offers by emailing us at the link provided on the
newsletter.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What Are
Cookies?</span><br>
A cookie is a very small text document,
which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you
visit a Web site, that site's computer asks your computer for
permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive
specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its
own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow
it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a
Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not
the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually
set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to
receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of your
browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser
refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will
not function as effectively when viewed by the
users.A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or
pass on computer viruses.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">How Do We
Use Information We Collect from
Cookies?</span><br>
As you visit and browse our Web site, the
site uses cookies to differentiate you from other users. In
some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from having to
log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in
conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to
calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site
and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us
gather feedback to constantly improve our Web site and better
serve our clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any
personal information about you and we do not intentionally
store any personal information that your browser provided to us
in your cookies.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">IP
Addresses</span><br>
IP addresses are used by your computer
every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address
is a number that is used by computers on the network to
identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically
collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile
data known as traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages
you request) can be sent to you.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sharing
and Selling
Information</span><br>
We <b>do not</b> share, sell, lend or
lease any of the information that uniquely identify a
subscriber (such as email addresses or personal details) with
anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process
transactions or provide services that you have
requested.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">How Can
You Access and Correct Your
Information?</span><br>
You may request access to all your
personally identifiable information that we collect online and
maintain in our database by emailing us at the usual
address.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What
About Legally
Compelled Disclosure of Information?</span><br>
We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in
other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law
requires it or for the protection of our legal
rights. We may also disclose
account information when we have reason to believe that
disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact
or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our
Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our users and the
Public.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What
About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web
Site?</span><br>
We are not responsible for the practices
employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site or the
information or content contained therein. Often links to other
Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on
topics that may be useful to the users of our Web
site.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">Please remember that when you use a link
to go from
our Website to another web site, our Privacy Policy is no
longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other
web site, including web sites, which have a link on our
Website, is subject to that Web site's own rules and policies.
Please read over those rules and policies before
proceeding.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Your
Consent</span><br>
By using our Web site you consent to our
collection and use of your personal information as described in
this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to amend this privacy
policy at any time with or without notice.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Our
Commitment To Data
Security:</span><br>
Please note that your
information will be stored and processed on our computers in
the United States. The laws on holding personal data in the
United States may be less stringent than the laws of your
Country of residence or citizenship. To prevent unauthorized access,
maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we
have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out</span><br>
This site allows
visitors to unsubscribe so that they will not receive future
messages. After unsubscribing we will discontinue sending the
particular messages as soon as technically
feasible.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Surveys
&amp; Contests</span><br>
From time-to-time our site requests information from
users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys
or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has
a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
Information requested may include contact information (such as
name and shipping address), and demographic information (such
as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to
notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be
used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and
satisfaction of this site.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A
Special Note About Children</span><br>
Children are not eligible to use our services unsupervised and we ask
that children (under the age of 14) do not submit any personal
information to us. If you are a minor, you can use this service only in
conjunction with permission and guidance from your parents or guardians.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Acquisition
or Changes in
Ownership</span><br>
In
the event that the web site (or a substantial portion of its
assets) is acquired, your information would be considered part
of those assets, and may be part of those assets that are
transferred.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Policy
Modifications</span><br>
We may change this
Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when changes are made to
this privacy policy, we will email users who have given us
permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure
to check back periodically. However, please be assured that if
the Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the
personal information you have submitted to us under this
Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially inconsistent with
this Privacy Policy, without your prior
consent.</p>
