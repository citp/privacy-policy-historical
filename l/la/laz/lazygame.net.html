<h3>THE USE OF COOKIES TECHNOLOGY</h3>

<p>A "cookie" is a small data file which is transferred to your computer’s hard drive. We use cookie technology to make your use of our Site and our Services more convenient and to support our internal business purposes.</p>

<p>Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to alert you every time a cookie is offered, letting you decide whether or not to accept it. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. If you continue to use our Site and Services without disabling cookies we will assume that you are willing to accept all cookies from our Site.</p>

<p>You can, of course, use and visit our Site with cookies disabled, but you will not automatically be recognised by the Site upon re-visiting. We therefore recommend that you visit our Website using "Essential Cookies" as described below.</p>

<p><u>Essential Cookies</u></p>

<p>We use cookies to identify you when you visit our Sites e.g. we use session cookies to recall your e-mail address so you don’t have to re-enter this information each time you visit. Cookies allow us to tailor your unique user experience.</p>

<p>We may collect the following personal data through essential cookies: a unique ID assigned to your device; IP address; device and browser type; operating system; referring URLs; content viewed or other actions taken on our sites and apps; time and date of those actions; country and language selected.</p>

<p><u>Analytics Cookies</u></p>

<p>We use analytics cookies when we process your data and so we can manage and improve sites for monitoring, auditing, research and reporting purposes.</p>

<h3>The Use of Other Tracking Mechanisms</h3>

<p>Our Site may use technology such as web beacons, web bugs or clear GIFs to track and analyse non-personally identifiable usage information and to compile statistical information about our Users (e.g. their IP address, browser type, internet service provider etc.) in order to improve the Site's quality and to support our business.</p>

<p>You should note that We also use HTML5 localStorage technology to enhance your user experience. This technology operates in the same fashion as cookies technology and therefore we will use this mechanism to collect and store information as well as configure your experience in the same ways outlined above.</p>

	<li>to improve our Services;</li>
	<li>to provide you with the most user-friendly online experience;</li>
	<li>to use IP addresses and device identifiers to: identify the location of users, block disruptive use, establish the number of visits from different countries and other statistical purposes;</li>
</ul>

<h3>THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

<p>We will use your Personal Information for our internal business purposes e.g. to:</p>

<ul class="list-privacy">
