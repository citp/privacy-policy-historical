**_What information does labsafety.com gather about me?_**

_Registration, Ordering, Opt-In Newsletters_  
Basically, we collect only the information you choose to share. If you request a catalog, we collect your name and address. If you opt-in to an online newsletter, we ask for your e-mail address. If you place an order, we collect bill to/ship to information and your credit card details. Again, we collect only what you choose to give us. **And, we do not store your credit card account number in any way on the Web site or within a web accessible file.**

_Navigation_  
Knowing how customers use our site...tracking their movement through the site...helps us improve site design and usefulness. As a result, labsafety.com does use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

_Sharing_  
You can also be sure that Lab Safety Supply does not sell customer information to other direct marketers. 

_Removing Personal Information_  
You can cancel any of this information at any time. If you wish to be removed from our catalog mailing list or e-mail list, just call 1-800-356-0783 or e-mail us at [custsvc@labsafety.com](mailto:custsvc@labsafety.com). If you want to opt-out of an online newsletter, follow the simple instructions included at the end of each issue. Because mailing lists are prepared ahead of each promotion, your name may already be scheduled to receive one or two more promotions.

_Security_  
Labsafety.com takes every precaution to protect the information you give us...both online and off-line. When our registration or order forms asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry--SSL. While you're on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon at the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you're just surfing.

**_Will I get e-mail if I register or ask for a newsletter?_**

We send all new members a welcoming e-mail to verify password and username. Registered members will occasionally receive information on products, services, or special offers. If you do not want to receive this information, simply email our listmaster at [noemails@labsafety.com](mailto:noemails@labsafety.com) and ask to be removed from all e-comm promotions.

**_How does the Lab Safety Supply site recognize me when I visit?_**

Does Lab Safety Supply use cookies? The simple answer is yes. First we'll explain what cookies are and then we'll address why we use them.

Cookies are one-line text files that contain absolutely no personal information about you, **nor do they "hold" your credit card account number.** The cookie file is sent to your browser from our site when you register. It allows computers to "recognize" each other. When you return to the Lab Safety Supply Web site, a number in the text associates your computer with the information we're storing for you at Lab Safety Supply.

_What this means to you is that when you return to our site from the same computer, using the same password, your account information is available to you without requiring you to log in again. It saves you time and makes our site more helpful...it allows you to keep track of what you've ordered or maintain a running shopping list, for example._

If you don't want to keep your Lab Safety Supply cookies, you can delete them by "logging off" the site and signing in each time you return.

**_How does my personal shopping account work?_**

If you are a registered labsafety.com user, you receive the benefit of a personal shopping account. It's convenient for you...the Web site remembers who you are. What that means is, when you come back to our site, the shipping and billing information you have provided pops right back up. There's no need for you to enter it over each time you place an order. The information you provide is stored on a secure database and is seen by no one but you. All the information is provided to us and retrieved using a secure socket layer (SSL) connection.

Once you've registered, all you need to get into that account is your e-mail address and password. Then you have one-click access to all your account information.

Of course, this service is provided as a convenience to you...to make shopping at labsafety.com easier. **The most important part is that you control exactly what information to store and how it is used.** And remember, you can change the settings or erase the account any time you choose.

**_What happens when I e-mail Lab Safety Supply?_**

Every message sent to any of Lab Safety Supply's company e-mail boxes (i.e. [custsvc@labsafety.com,](mailto:custsvc@labsafety.com) [techsvc@labsafety.com](mailto:techsvc@labsafety.com) or [prez@labsafety.com](mailto:prez@labsafety.com)) are read within 24 hours. Our goal is to respond back to you in 24 hours, as well.

If you've registered with labsafety.com, we do keep your e-mail address on file for future promotions, but we do not sell that address to other companies. If you do not want to receive information about new products, new site features or special offers, you can ask to be taken off our e-mail list by following the instructions included at the end of each email message you get from us. Or you can simply e-mail our listmaster at [noemails@labsafety.com](mailto:noemails@labsafety.com) and ask to be removed from all e-comm promotions.
