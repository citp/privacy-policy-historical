However, if your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our Site.

One type of cookie, known as a "persistent" cookie, is set when you log in to your LabRoots account. The next time you visit the Site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing user so you will not need to re-enter your password before using the Site. In order to access or change any of your private information (like a credit card number), you must log in securely by re-entering your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie. If you log out of the Site, you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit the Site in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called a "session" cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.

We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your Internet service provider. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve our Site and its operation.
