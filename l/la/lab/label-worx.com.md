### Overview

The Website, Apps and Services shall be collectively referred to as the “Platform” within this Privacy Policy.

The Company operates a “business to business” rights management service. Prior to being accepted by the Company and executing a contract for services, the Company will collect and stores certain types of data in order to determine whether a business relationship can be established. The manner of the data collection will be set out in this Privacy Policy. Once a services contract has been executed between you and the Company all data submitted by you will be subject to the terms of that contract, this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions. Please read these documents carefully and check them regularly as we may amend the Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions from time to time.

By using or interacting with our Platform, you are accepting the practices described in our Privacy Policy and you are providing specific, informed and unambiguous consent to the use of your information in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.

We reserve the right to modify or amend the terms of our Privacy Policy from time to time without notice. Your continued use of our Platform and our affiliate sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or don't see your concerns addressed here, you should contact us by email at [privacy@label-worx.com](mailto:privacy@label-worx.com).
