**SHARING COLLECTED DATA WITH OTHERS**

Areas of this web site that serve you to conduct e-commerce may share your information with outside companies to allow for processing of those transactions. 

Occasionally, Lacava LLC hires outside services to perform mailing and other promotional services, in which cases the collected data is shared with those outside companies. However, those companies are only provided the personal data necessary for delivery of the service and are required to keep the information confidential and prohibited from making use of that data for any other purposes. Lacava LLC may be required to disclose personal information in legal proceedings if ordered so by the law, or to protect our company rights, and property.
