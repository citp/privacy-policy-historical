  The City only collects personally identifiable information that is required

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial"><strong>Access

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">Access 
  to personally identifiable information in public records at state and local 
  levels of government in Los Angeles is controlled primarily by the California 
  Public Records Act (Government Code Section 6250, et seq.). Information that 
  is generally available under the Public Records Act may be posted for electronic 
  access through the City's web site. While the Public Records Act sets the general 
  policies for access to City records, other sections of California code as well 
  as federal laws also deal with confidentiality issues.</span></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial"><strong>E-mail

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">	
  E-mail addresses obtained through the web site will not be sold or given to 
  other private companies for marketing purposes. The information collected is 
  subject to the access and confidentiality provisions of the Public Records Act, 
  other applicable sections of the California code as well as federal laws. E-mail 
  or other information requests sent to the City web site may be maintained in 
  order to respond to the request, forward that request to the appropriate agency 
  within the City, communicate updates to the City page that may be of interest 
  to citizens, or to provide the City web designer with valuable customer feedback 
  to assist in improving the site. Individuals can cancel any communications regarding 
  new service updates at any time.</span></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br wp="BR2">

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial"><strong>Cookies</strong></span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">	
  Some City applications use "cookies." A cookie is a small data file that certain 
  web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain 
  information such as a user id that the site uses to track the pages you have 
  visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information 
  you supply yourself. A cookie is only a text file and cannot read data off your 
  hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies can track user 
  traffic patterns, recognize your computer's browser when you return, and could 
  provide personalized content without requiring sign-in.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">	
  You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. However, they may 
  be required to use some of the web applications on the City's site. </span></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial"><strong>Google Analytics Cookie Tracking</strong></span></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">	
  Some City applications use Google Analytics cookies to log user sessions and help us understand traffic and behavior. This helps us analyze data about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes.</span></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">	
 Some City applications include the Google Analytics Display Advertising feature used to provide Demographics and Interest Reporting. This feature uses a third party DoubleClick Cookie.</span></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">	
 To provide website visitors the ability to prevent their data from being used by Google Analytics, Google has developed the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on for the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, dc.js). This add-on instructs the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) running on websites to prohibit sending information to Google Analytics. However, the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on does not prevent data from being sent to the City’s site. <br>
 Visit <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a> for more info on how to opt out.</span></font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">	
 Please note that updates to your browser or operating system may affect the functionality of the opt-out add-on. The latest versions of Internet Explorer sometimes load the Google Analytics opt-out add-on after sending data to Google Analytics. Therefore, if you are using Internet Explorer, the add-on will set cookies on your computer. These cookies ensure that any collected data is immediately deleted from the collection server. Please make sure that third party cookies aren’t disabled for your Internet Explorer browser. If you delete your cookies, the add-on will, within a short timeframe, reset these cookies to ensure that your Google Analytics browser add-on remains fully functional.</span></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial">	
 The following chart is a detailed list of Google Analytics cookies that would be used.</span></font></p>
