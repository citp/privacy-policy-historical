## What are the legal bases we rely upon when collecting your personal data?

The law on data protection sets out a number of different reasons for which a company may collect and process your personal data, including:

### Consent

In specific situations, we collect and process your data with your consent.

An example of consent is when you tick a box to receive email newsletters.

When collecting your personal data, we’ll always make clear to you which data is necessary in connection with a particular service.

### Contractual obligations

In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligations.

An example of a contractual obligation is when you order an item from us for home delivery, we collect your address details in order to deliver your purchase, and pass them to our courier.

### Legal compliance

In certain circumstances, the law requires us to collect and process your data.

An example of legal compliance is when we pass on details of people involved in fraud or other criminal activity affecting the Partnership to law enforcement.

### Legitimate interest

In specific situations, we require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.

For example, we will use your purchase history to send you or make available personalised offers.

We also combine the shopping history of many customers to identify trends and ensure we can keep up with demand, or develop new products/services.

We will also use your address details to send you direct marketing information by post, telling you about products and services that we think might interest you.

## How do we manage Data?

Lands’ End is the data controller of the personal data that we hold and as such we process personal data only in compliance with applicable data protection laws, including the Data Protection Act 1998, the Data Protection Regulation (EU) (2016/679) (the " **GDPR** ") and any Act deriving from the Data Protection Bill 2017, now before Parliament and any successor legislation to any of the above (together, the " **Data Protection Laws** ").

Subject to your consent, Lands’ End may share your personal data with third parties for direct marketing purposes, as further described in the " _Who do we share your information with_ " and " _Your choices and privacy rights_ " sections below.

## How and why we use your personal data?

We want to give you the best possible customer experience. One way to achieve that is to get the richest picture we can of who you are by combining the data we have about you.

We then use this to offer you promotions, products and services that are most likely to interest you. In the case of loyalty scheme members, we’ll also offer you relevant rewards.

The data privacy law allows this as part of our legitimate interest in understanding our customers and providing the highest levels of service.

Remember, if you choose not to share your personal data with us, or refuse certain contact permissions, we might not be able to provide some services you’ve asked for.

For example, if you’ve asked us to let you know when an item comes back into stock, we can’t do that if you’ve withdrawn your general consent to hear from us.

When we no longer need to use your information, we will remove it from our systems and records and/or take steps to properly anonymise it so that you can no longer be identified from it (unless we need to keep your information to comply with legal or regulatory obligations to which we are subject).

## Where do we protect and store your personal data?

The personal data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") (for example, in the USA). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our service providers. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy & Security Policy and applicable data protection laws, including, where relevant, entering into EU standard contractual clauses in accordance with Article 46.2 GDPR (or equivalent measures) with the party outside the EEA receiving the personal information.

## Security of Transactions

At Lands’ End we take your security very seriously indeed and encrypt consumer data, such as credit card numbers, when you order directly through the website. We transfer the encrypted data over the Internet using secure socket layer (SSL) technology so that your online shopping experience is safe and secure.

In the case of fraud, we’ll assume all liability for what you owe. This means that we’ll pick up the first £50, and the credit card company takes responsibility for the rest. If you prefer to order products from our website by telephone, please call our order line on 0800 376 7974 (UK only) or (+44) 1572 758070 (outside UK).

The website also invites you to contact Lands’ End via email, through the ’Contact Us’ page at [www.landsend.co.uk/ContactUs](https://www.landsend.co.uk/ContactUs).

Although we use advanced security measures to protect your information against loss, misuse and alteration, as is the case with all computer networks linked to the Internet, we cannot absolutely guarantee the security of your information provided over the Internet and cannot be responsible for this.

Lands’ End may disclose information we collect in the following ways, to the extent permitted by applicable law:

Specifically, as an example, if during checkout you have provided your mobile phone number to receive notifications (via phone or text/SMS) about the delivery of your package(s), we will share your contact information with the applicable courier(s) who will use your information for that limited purpose and only on our behalf. If you would like to know more information about the third-party companies currently charged with such data processing, please contact us with your request at [www.landsend.co.uk/ContactUs](https://www.landsend.co.uk/ContactUs)
