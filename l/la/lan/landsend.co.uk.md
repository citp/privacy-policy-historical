**"When I visit your Web site, what information do you gather about me?"**  
One of the basic principles we've followed in designing this Web site is that we ask for only the information we need to provide the service you've requested. As a result, the answer to this question depends almost entirely on how you choose to make use of our Web site and our growing list of Web site services.

Currently, Web site customers provide information in order to take advantage of the following services: 

  * **Catalogue Requests.** Naturally, we need a name and an address to send the catalogue to. Plus a contact — phone or e-mail — in case the address is wrong. To be removed from our mailing list at any time, call 0800 279 9598. 
  * **Purchases.** Name, address, phone or e-mail, and credit card information are necessary for purchase and delivery. 
  * **Address book services.** To provide this service, we need the addresses you like us to remember.   




We do just one thing with the information you provide that you may not expect. If you purchase a product from us, there is a chance that we will exchange your name with another company whose products and services might interest you.

If you do not want to have your name traded with other companies, please call 0800 376 7974 and one of our operators will help you. You can also contact us via [e-mail](http://www1.landsend.co.uk/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ExecMacro/LandsEndUK/legbr_Help.d2w/report?mdiv=cu).

**Personal Shopping Accounts**  
Many Web site customers have requested a more convenient way to place orders. In particular, they've asked us to find a way to "remember" the address and credit card information they provided with a previous order.

In response to these requests, we've added Personal Shopping Accounts to our list of Web site services. A personal shopping account allows you to store information with us. Currently, we'll keep an unlimited number of shipping addresses. In the coming months, we'll be adding more features to Personal Shopping Accounts. The information is stored on a secure database and is seen by no one but you. All the information is provided to us and retrieved using a secure socket layer (SSL) connection.

Once you've set up an account, you can identify yourself at any time with a name and password. Then you have one-click access to all your addresses and your billing information.

Once again, this is a service intended to make shopping easier. You can choose whether or not to take advantage of it. You also control exactly what information Lands' End stores and how it is used. And of course, you can change the settings or erase the account at any time.

**"How do you keep track of me as I move through the Web site?"**  
In the original design for the Web, there was no way for a Web site to know whether one page request was connected to another. For most sites, this is fine. In a news site, for example, each article is independent of the others. Visitors see what they want, then leave.

But for those of us selling on the Internet, this is a real problem. We want people to be able to select several products before purchasing them. We want the selection process and the checkout process to span more than one page. In other words, we need a way of keeping track of Web site _sessions_ rather than merely page requests.

The way Lands' End deals with this is with a "state ID." Your state ID is the long number you can see at the end of all the URLs on the Lands' End Web site. The state ID contains absolutely no information about you. It is completely unique to each session, and changes each time a new session is created. The sole purpose is to enable us to know that the person who added the mesh shirt to their basket is the same person as the one who wants the denim dress.

If you have a personal shopping account, the session ID allows us to remember who you are once you have identified yourself. In other words, the act of logging in is the act of associating the random session ID with the person for whom we're keeping certain pieces of information.

**"Does Lands' End use cookies?"**  
Specifically, if you select "remember my ID and Password" when you register for a personal account, our site sends a cookie to your browser to put in its cookie file. This cookie contains absolutely no personal information about you. The cookie file is merely a text file, and the cookie we add is nothing but a line of text. When you return to the Lands' End site, a number in this text associates your computer with the information we're storing for you at Lands' End.

The result is when you return to Lands End using the same computer, your personal Shopping Account information is available to you without needing to log in.

**Interacting with Lands' End via e-mail**  
We read every message that comes to us. We also try to respond back within at least 24 hours of its receipt.

We **never** sell or give out e-mail addresses to anyone.

At Lands' End, we save messages and/or e-mail addresses only for a few specific reasons. We save messages if we think we'll need to refer to them later when we communicate with the customer. We keep e-mail addresses on file for our Overstocks and "What's New at Lands' End" newsletters, and occasional notices from us about helpful new features on the site (the recipient can choose to not receive such notices). And we save e-mail addresses as customers' user names for their Personal Shopping Accounts.
