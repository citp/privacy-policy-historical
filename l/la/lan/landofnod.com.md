Information sharing can provide a valuable type of consumer networking. When you make a purchase with us, your name and mailing address is shared with other select catalog companies whose products and services you may find useful. By helping to make these connections, we hope to introduce you to new products that are compatible with your interests and needs. Rest assured that your email address and confidential credit card information are never shared with any other company or third party.

We appreciate and respect that not all customers may wish to benefit from the opportunity to share information with other select companies.

To prevent a child’s name from being added to our database, we suggest that you refrain from listing your child’s name as the purchaser or recipient on an order.

## Mmmm, Cookies

This provider may collect anonymous information about your visits to our website, and your interaction with our products and services.

This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major websites. They do not know the name, phone number, postal address, email address or any other personal information about the user because this information is made anonymous before it reaches the provider.
