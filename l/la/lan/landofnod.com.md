Secure Shopping  
For your security, orders on our site are encrypted with SSL technology on both the client and server end. Your information sent via the Internet can be trusted to arrive privately and unaltered, to our server only. In order for SSL security to work, you must use an SSL-enabled browser.

Your Privacy Online  
At The Land of Nod, we are committed to ensuring the privacy of our customers. We keep confidential any information entered during ordering and registration. While our website automatically recognizes your Internet Service Provider, you cannot be identified as an individual. When someone makes a purchase at landofnod.com, we keep track of which pages of our site are visited in order to improve your overall shopping experience. We also use anonymous information about your visits to our website, and your interaction with our products and services, to target advertisements for goods and services on other websites. This anonymous information is collected by a third-party service provider through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major web sites. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this anonymous information used by our third party service provider, please click here. 

In an effort to offer you the best and most current shopping opportunities, if you sign up for our email list, we may contact you with news about our products, services and events. If, for any reason, you would like to be removed from our email list, please contact us.
