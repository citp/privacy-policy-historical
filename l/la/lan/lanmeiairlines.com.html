		   <h2>11. Cookies And Web Beacons</h2>
		   <p>1)A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. Cookies will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. Two types of cookies are used on this website - session cookies, which are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the site, and persistent cookies, which remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). Most browsers have options that allow the visitor to control whether the browser will accept cookies, reject cookies, or notify the visitor each time a cookie is sent. You may elect to reject cookies by adjusting your browser's settings, but doing so will limit the range of features available to the visitor on our site and most other major websites that use cookies. To find out more information about cookies, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>
		   <p>2)Web beacons are used in conjunction with cookies to record the simple actions of the user opening the page that contains the beacon. When a user's browser requests information from a website in this way certain simple information can also be gathered, such as: the IP address of your computer; time the material was viewed; the type of browser that retrieved the image; and the existence of cookies previously set by that server. This is information that is available to any web server you visit. Web beacons do not give any "extra" information away. They are simply a convenient way of gathering the simplest of statistics and managing cookies.</p>

		   <h2>12. API (Advanced Passenger Information)　</h2>
		   <p>1)A growing number of destination countries oblige the airlines that fly to them to transmit passenger data before an aircraft lands in one of them. Usually, these legal regulations encompass the transmission of data on the passengers' identity and travel documents (passport, visa).</p>
		   <p>2)As a rule, an airline does not have these data, so it must collect them shortly before an aircraft departs, which increasingly is being done by means of the so-called 'machine-readable zone' in the new travel documents. If we are requested to transmit your passenger data to authorities other than the People’s Republic of China (for the purpose of this Privacy Policy, it shall not include Hong Kong SPR, Macau SPR and Taiwan Province), we will obtain your consent before doing so.</p>
		   <p>3)Collection of the data is done solely for immediate transmission to the authorities of the destination country.</p>

		   <h2>13. Data Security</h2>
		   <p>Lanmei a takes your data security very seriously. In addition to complying with all applicable data security regulations, to ensure the highest possible security for the transmission of your data between your web browser and our internet system we use the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encrypting technology. SSL is an industry standard way to send personal information over the Internet. It enables an encrypted communication respectively transfer of documents via the internet between web browser and web server. The URL of a website with SSL connection to your browser starts with https://. SSL is fast, secure, and it ensures that your personal information will not be read by anyone else.</p>
