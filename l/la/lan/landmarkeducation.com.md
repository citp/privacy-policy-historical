# Landmark Education: Privacy Policy

Landmark Education ("Landmark") has adopted the following Privacy Policy, which is applicable to all personally identifiable information that you provide to Landmark through LandmarkEducation.com (the Site) or for purposes of using the Site. 

You must also review and accept our [LandmarkEducation.com Terms of Use](http://www.landmarkeducation.com/termsofuse.aspx) as it's also applicable and governs your use of the Site. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any personally identifiable information that you may provide to third parties, such as through other sites linked to the Site. Please be aware that if you choose to visit such third party sites, you should contact such third parties directly to determine their respective privacy policies because that third party's privacy policy, and not Landmark's, will govern your activities and any personally identifiable information you disclose while visiting the third party site.

Landmark expressly reserves at its sole discretion, and at times and intervals of its choosing, the right to change this Privacy Policy periodically in the future without prior notice to you or Authorized Users (both as defined below). Review our Privacy Policy available at [[http://landmarkeducation.com/About_Us/Privacy_Policy.aspx](http://www.landmarkeducation.com/privacypolicy.aspx)] regularly to be sure you are fully current with our practices and procedures in this area. Your continued use of the Site will be subject to the then-current Privacy Policy.

The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Site:

**Overview**  
As part of the normal operation of the Site, we collect and, in some cases, may disclose personally identifiable information about you. This Privacy Policy describes the personally identifiable information we collect about you and what may happen to that information.

By accepting this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information in the manner prescribed in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the LandmarkEducation.com Terms of Use and governs all use of the Site.

**Children**  
Landmark recognizes the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. No personally identifiable information of children under age 18 is collected on the Site and the Site is not intended for children under the age of 18. Children are not permitted to provide any personally identifiable information on or through the Site.

**Restricted Areas**  
Certain areas are restricted ("Restricted Areas") to users who are graduates of Landmark's programs and who join or register (become an Authorized User). Users (non-Authorized Users) may have limited access to the Site provided that such users accept the Landmark Education Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy; and (ii) create a username and password.

**Merchandise Areas**  
Merchandise offered for sale on LandmarkEducation.com is sold and distributed by Promotional Product Solutions (PPS). Your use of the LE site for the purpose of shopping for merchandise or purchasing merchandise is subject to the [PPS Privacy Policy](http://stores.nationalpremium.com/landmarkstore/PrivacyPolicy.asp) .

**Information We Collect  
**We may collect your name, address, email address, telephone number, and other personally identifiable information you submit in connection with the processes of setting up an account (getting a username and password); registering for a course, program, or event. Such personally identifiable information will not be posted in areas of the Site viewable by the public or users of the Site. 

We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the Site using "cookies" (described below) and other devices. We use this information to do internal research Authorized Users' demographics, interests and behavior to better understand and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our Site or not), which URL you go to next (whether this URL is on our Site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address.  
**  
Our Use of Your Information**  
Our primary goal in collecting personally identifiable information is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that are most likely to meet your needs, and to customize the Site and our services to make your experience easier. We use personally identifiable information in the files we maintain about you, and the other personally identifiable information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site to provide you with services; resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; enforce the Landmark Education.com Terms of Use; identify multiple usernames, ID numbers, or aliases; improve our marketing and promotional efforts; analyze usage of the Site; improve our content and product offerings; and customize content, layout, and offerings on the Site. 

We also may use your personally identifiable information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of the Site. If you do not wish to receive communications such as those promoting product offerings, services and events, and you have set up a username and password, we encourage you to indicate your preference on the [Update Records/Account](https://web.archive.org/My_Account.aspx) page. However, you will continue to receive administrative notices and communications relevant to your use of the Site. You will also receive email confirmations if you register for a course online, subscribe to services, join a service as an Authorized User, or update records information.  
**  
Cookies and Aggregate Information**  
"Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customized services through the Site. We also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a cookie, for example course registration. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests and to personalize your user experience. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits. 

The Site may track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the URL from which you came to these Site, the URL to which you transfer after using these Site, the browser type and IP addresses. We may analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used, and disclosed in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information. We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  
**  
Our Disclosure of Your Information**  
Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be required to disclose personally identifiable information to the government, law enforcement agencies, or third parties under certain circumstances; third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications; or users or Authorized Users may independently abuse or misuse your information that they collect from the Site in violation of our Landmark Education Terms of Use. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will always remain private.

As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personally identifiable information may be disclosed. 

**Advertisers.** We may aggregate (gather data across all Authorized Users) personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for other marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally. 

**Other Corporate Entities.** We may sometimes share data with our affiliates, subsidiaries, joint ventures and third party service providers that provide us with services and/or provide you with services. To the extent that these entities have access to your personally identifiable information, we will ask them to treat it at least as protectively as they treat personally identifiable information they obtain from their other Authorized users or members. Our affiliates, subsidiaries, and joint ventures will follow privacy practices no less protective of all Authorized users and members than our practices described in this document, to the extent allowed by applicable law. It is possible that Landmark, its subsidiaries, affiliates, joint ventures or any combination of such, could merge with or be acquired by another business entity. Should such a combination occur, you should expect that Landmark would share some or all of your personally identifiable information in order to continue to maintain and provide access to the Site. You will receive notice of such event (to the extent it occurs), and we will require that the new combined entity follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy.

**Legal Requests.** Landmark cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws relating to matters, such as intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any personally identifiable information about you to law enforcement and other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe reasonably necessary or appropriate, in connection with any investigation.

**Your Use of Authorized User Information**  
Under no circumstances, can you disclose personally identifiable information about another Authorized User to any third party without our consent and the consent of such other Authorized User after adequate disclosure. Landmark Authorized Users do not tolerate spam. Therefore, without limiting the foregoing, you are not licensed to add an Authorized User to your mail list (email or physical mail) without their express written consent after adequate disclosure.   
**  
Changing Your Personally Identitifable Information**  
After setting up an account (creating a username and password) you can review and change specific information you submitted during the process of setting up the account, including your password, email address, occupation, marital status, name, address, city, state, zip code, country, and phone number by visiting [Update Records/Account](https://web.archive.org/My_Account.aspx) page.

If you would like to request a change to other information regarding your account or your participation in Landmark programs, you may contact us at [grad.records@landmarkeducation.net](mailto:grad.records@landmarkeducation.net).

We will, however, retain in our files and databases personally identifiable information you have requested to remove in order to use it in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our terms and conditions. Further, such prior personally identifiable information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical and legal constraints, including stored "back up" systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personally identifiable information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.  
**  
****Security**  
Landmark may use reasonable security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, such as "firewalls," Secure Socket Layers (SSL), and other physical and electronic security measures. However, you agree and acknowledge that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.

**Questions and Updates.**  
If you have any questions or suggestions about our privacy practices, please feel free to contact us at legal@landmarkeducation.net.

This Privacy Policy is effective as of: 07/16/2010
