This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information that we collect through the Site and when you contact us. 

**2.Information we collect**

We collect information when you provide it to us.  We also collect information about you through automated technologies on our Site and from third parties.  When we link information to you that was collected through automated technology, we treat that information as Personal Information.

**Information that you provide**  
Landmark and our Affiliates and Service Providers collect Personal Information from you when you provide it.  For example, you might provide us with your Personal Information when you e-mail us, sign up for an e-mail newsletter, participate in a promotion, survey or other feature of the Site, register for an account, make payment on your account, communicate or interact with us through our Site. ****  
If you do not want your Personal Information collected, please do not submit it. ****

**Automated information and cookies**  
When you visit or interact with us, we and our Affiliates and Service Providers may use technologies that automatically collect information about how you access, navigate and leave our Site.  For example, we will collect information on what other website you came from before visiting the Site, what browser type and operating system you are using, the internet protocol (IP) address you are accessing the Site from, the pages you are navigating through and what website you go to after visiting our Site.  In general, we do not associate this type of information with other Personal Information about you except in the case of an investigation into our website security.
