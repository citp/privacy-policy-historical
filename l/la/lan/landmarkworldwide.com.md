Landmark Worldwide("Landmark") has adopted the following Privacy Policy, which is applicable to all personally identifiable information that you provide to Landmark through LandmarkWorldwide.com as well as other Landmark websites and microsites (collectively the "Site") and the information that we collect through your use of the Site.

References to "Landmark", "we", "us" or "our" are references to: Landmark Worldwide LLC of 353 Sacramento Street, Suite 200, San Francisco, CA 94111, USA.

Please also review the [LandmarkWorldwide.com Terms of Use](http://www.landmarkworldwide.com/terms-of-use) (the "Terms of Use"), which incorporate this Privacy Policy and govern your use of the Site.

Landmark may change this Privacy Policy periodically. Review our Privacy Policy available at [http://LandmarkWorldwide.com/About_US/Privacy_Policy.aspx](http://www.landmarkworldwide.com/privacy-policy) regularly to be sure you are fully current with our practices and procedures in this area. If we make a material change that will affect the way that we use personally identifiable information that we already have collected about you, we will endeavor to notify you by posting a notice on our Site and sending an email to our registered users. We will post the last date of any change to this Privacy Policy at the bottom of this page. Your continued use of the Site will be subject to the then-current Privacy Policy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Site:

Overview  
As part of the normal operation of the Site, we collect and, in some cases, may disclose personally identifiable information about you. This Privacy Policy describes the information, including personally identifiable information, that we collect about you and what may happen to that information.

Children  
Landmark recognizes the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. Children are not permitted to provide any personally identifiable information on or through the Site.

Restricted Areas  
Certain areas of the Site are restricted ("Restricted Areas") to users who are graduates of Landmark's programs, are registered for certain Landmark programs and have created an account with us ("Authorized Users"). You may browse our Site without being an Authorized User, but the features and functions may be limited.

Information We Collect  
We may collect your name, address, email address, telephone number, and other personally identifiable information you submit in connection with the processes of setting up an account (getting a username and password) and registering for a course, program, or event. Such personally identifiable information will not be posted in areas of the Site viewable by the public or Authorized Users of the Site. As discussed below, certain portions of our Site permit user generated content. If you post content to those portions of the Site, the information that you post will be available to other users.

We also collect information from you if you contact us for any purpose. The scope of the information that we collect will be based on your particular inquiry.

In addition, we automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the Site using "cookies" and other devices (described below).

Our Use of Your Information  
Our primary goal in collecting your information, including your personally identifiable information, is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that are most likely to meet your needs, and to customize the Site and our services to make your experience easier. We use personally identifiable information in the files we maintain about you, and the other personally identifiable information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site to provide you with services; resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; enforce the Terms of Use; identify multiple usernames, ID numbers, or aliases; analyze usage of the Site; improve our content and product offerings; customize content, layout, and offerings on the Site; to respond to your inquiries, and for other customer services purposes. We also may use your information for legal purposes, to protect our rights and interests, our Site, and other users of our Site and services. As discussed below, we also may use your personally identifiable information for marketing purposes.

Marketing  
We will use your personally identifiable information for marketing purposes. Among other purposes, we may send you communications via email, including promotional communications about products and services that we believe would be of interest to you.

You may opt-out of the receipt of marketing communications from us by following the link contained in the email. Alternatively, if you have registered and paid for a course or have created an account on this Site, you may update your preferences on the [Update Records/Account page](https://www.landmarkworldwide.com/ec/Updateaccount). Please note that it may take up to 10 days to process your request.

If you opt out of receiving marketing communications from us, we will continue to send administrative notices and communications relevant to your use of the Site to you via email. You will also receive email confirmations if you register for a course online, subscribe to services, join a service as an Authorized User, or update records information.

Our Disclosure of Your Information  
We do not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties for their own marketing purposes. We may disclose the information that we collect about you, including your personally identifiable information, as follows:

  * **Service Providers.** We may share your personally identifiable information with third party service providers that provide services on our behalf. To the extent that these entities have access to your personally identifiable information, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that they treat it at least as protectively as they treat personally identifiable information they obtain from their own customers, users or members, and in accordance with applicable law.
  * **Affiliates.** We also may share your personally identifiable information with our affiliates to assist us in providing services to you, and, where applicable, to notify you about products and services that may be relevant to you.
  * **Joint Venture Partners.** We also may share your information with our joint venture partners to assist us in providing services that we both make available to you.
  * **In Response to Legal Process/To Protect Ourselves and Others.** We may disclose your personally identifiable information to the government, law enforcement agencies, or third parties to comply with the law, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose your personally identifiable information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use or this Policy, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
  * **Business Transfers.** If Landmark, its subsidiaries, affiliates, joint ventures or any combination of such, is acquired by or merged with another company, if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer the information that we have collected about you, including your personally identifiable information, to the other company.
  * **Aggregate Data.** We may aggregate (gather data across all Authorized Users) personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for other marketing and promotional purposes.
  * **Credit Card Information.** We do not store credit card details nor do we share your credit card information with third parties for any purpose other than the provision of the requested service.



Cookies and Other Tracking  
We use cookies, web beacons, analytics, and other tracking mechanisms to collect information automatically about visitors to our Site. Specifically, we track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the URL from which you came to the Site, the URL to which you transfer after using this Site, the browser type and IP addresses. We may analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used, and disclosed in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information. We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

  * **Cookies.** "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customized services through the Site. We also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a cookie, for example course registration. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests and to personalize your user experience. There are two primary types of cookies: Session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.

You can block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. You may wish to visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) which contains comprehensive information about how to do this on a variety of browsers and about cookies generally.

However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of our Site.

  * **Web Beacons, Pixel Tags and Other Technologies.** We use web beacons, such as clear GIFs, web bugs or pixel tags, which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers to help us track e-mail response rates, measure the success of our marketing campaigns, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.
  * **Site Analytics.** We work with third party service providers who use the technologies described in this section and other tracking means to conduct analytics to help us track and understand how visitors use our Site. For example, we use a variety of third party web analytics, including Google Analytics, to help us improve our Site's performance and user experiences.



Third Party Applications  
Third party applications may be available on our Site. The owners or providers of those third party applications may collect information from you. Their collection of information is bound by their own information collection policies and practices. We are not responsible for the collection and use of your information by third parties.

Your Use of User Information  
Certain features of our Site enable you to have access to other users of our Site. For example, you may interact with other users through seminars and various forums. You are prohibited from disclosing personally identifiable information about another user, including Authorized Users, that you learn through these or other portions of our Site or otherwise, to any third party without our consent and the informed consent of such other user. Our users do not tolerate spam. Therefore, without limiting the foregoing, you are not licensed to add any user to your mail list (email or physical mail) without their express written informed consent.

Accessing and Changing Your Personally Identifiable Information  
After setting up an account (creating a username and password) you can review and change specific information you submitted during the process of setting up the account or registering for a course, including your password, email address, occupation, marital status, name, address, city, state, zip code, country, and phone number by visiting the [Update Records/Account page](https://www.landmarkworldwide.com/ec/Updateaccount).

If you would like to request a change to other information regarding your account or your participation in Landmark programs, you may contact us at [grad.records@landmarkworldwide.com](mailto:grad.records@landmarkworldwide.com).

If you are located in Canada and you require any information about your personal information under our custody and control, how such information is being used or disclosed by us, or if you require corrections to your personal information, you may submit your questions and requests in writing to our Privacy Officer:

Retention of Data  
We will retain in our files and databases personally identifiable information for as long as necessary for our business purposes, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, as required by law, or to enforce the Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy.

Safe Harbor  
With respect to the personal data we receive from countries in the European Economic Area and Switzerland, we have certified our adherence to the US-EU and the US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles. You can find our Safe Harbor certification at <https://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx>. For more information about these Safe Harbor Principles, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's website at <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>. To request a copy of our Safe Harbor Policy, please check our certification at <https://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx> or email [dataprivacy@themedco.com](mailto:dataprivacy@themedco.com).

In compliance with the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles, Landmark Worldwide commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Landmark Worldwide at [legal@landmarkworldwide.com](mailto:legal@landmarkworldwide.com).

Landmark Worldwide has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Landmark Education, please visit the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR web site at [www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints](http://www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints) for more information and to file a complaint.

Storage of Data  
The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored, at a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"), including in the United States. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us (e.g., to fulfill your order or provide support services). By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. 

Links from our Site  
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any personally identifiable information that you may provide to third parties, such as through other sites linked to the Site. Please be aware that if you choose to visit such third party sites, you should contact such third parties directly to determine their respective privacy policies because that third party's privacy policy, and not Landmark's, will govern your activities and any personally identifiable information you disclose while visiting the third party site.

Security  
Landmark will use reasonable security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information, such as "firewalls," Secure Socket Layers (SSL), and other physical and electronic security measures where appropriate. However, you agree and acknowledge that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. Although we will take reasonable steps to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Site: any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information we will use reasonable procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.

User Generated Content  
Certain portions of our Site, such as our blogs and forums, permit user generated content. If you post content to our Site, all of the information that you post will be available to other persons visiting the Site. Your posting becomes public and we cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law, or your personal privacy.

Questions and Updates  
If you have any questions or suggestions about our privacy practices, please feel free to contact our Privacy Officer in writing at the address set out above or by email to the Privacy Officer at: [legal@landmarkworldwide.com](mailto:legal@landmarkworldwide.com).

If you are located in Canada and you are dissatisfied with our handling of your personal information, we invite you to contact our Privacy Officer in writing, setting out the reasons for your concern. If, after our Privacy Officer has reviewed and responded to your concern, you remain dissatisfied, you may wish to contact the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner for your local province or state.

This Privacy Policy is effective as of: 05/20/2013
