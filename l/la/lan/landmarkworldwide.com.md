  * **Service Providers.** We may share your personally identifiable information with third party service providers that provide services on our behalf.

  * **In Response to Legal Process/To Protect Ourselves and Others.** We may be required to disclose your personally identifiable information to the government, public authorities, law enforcement agencies, or third parties to comply with the law, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We also may disclose your personally identifiable information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use or this Policy, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
  * **Business Transfers.** If Landmark, its subsidiaries, affiliates, joint ventures or any combination of such, is acquired by or merged with another company, if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer the information that we have collected about you, including your personally identifiable information, to the other company.
  * **Aggregate Data.** We may aggregate (gather data across all Authorized Users) personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for other marketing and promotional purposes.
  * **Credit Card Information.** We do not store credit card details nor do we share your credit card information with third parties for any purpose other than the provision of the requested service.



**Cookies and Other Tracking**  
We use cookies, web beacons, analytics, and other tracking mechanisms to collect information automatically about visitors to our Site. Specifically, we track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the URL from which you came to the Site, the URL to which you transfer after using this Site, the browser type and IP addresses. We may analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used, and disclosed in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information. We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

  * **Cookies.** "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customized services through the Site. We also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a cookie, for example course registration. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests and to personalize your user experience. There are two primary types of cookies: Session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.

You can block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. You may wish to visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) which contains comprehensive information about how to do this on a variety of browsers and about cookies generally.

However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of our Site.

  * **Web Beacons, Pixel Tags and Other Technologies.** We use web beacons, such as clear GIFs, web bugs or pixel tags, which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers to help us track e-mail response rates, measure the success of our marketing campaigns, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.
  * **Site Analytics.** We work with third party service providers who use the technologies described in this section and other tracking means to conduct analytics to help us track and understand how visitors use our Site. For example, we use a variety of third party web analytics, including Google Analytics, to help us improve our Site's performance and user experiences.



**Your Use of User Information**  
Certain features of our Site enable you to have access to other users of our Site. For example, you may interact with other users through seminars and various forums. You are prohibited from disclosing personally identifiable information about another user, including Authorized Users, that you learn through these or other portions of our Site or otherwise, to any third party without our consent and the informed consent of such other user. Our users do not tolerate spam. Therefore, without limiting the foregoing, you are not licensed to add any user to your mail list (email or physical mail) without their express written informed consent.

**Accessing and Changing Your Personally Identifiable Information**

We will retain in our files and databases personally identifiable information for as long as necessary for our business purposes, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, as required by law, or to enforce the Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy.

**Storage of Data**  
The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored, at a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"), including in the United States.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any personally identifiable information that you may provide to third parties, such as through other sites linked to the Site. Please be aware that if you choose to visit such third party sites, you should contact such third parties directly to determine their respective privacy policies because that third party's privacy policy, and not Landmark's, will govern your activities and any personally identifiable information you disclose while visiting the third party site.

**Security**  
Landmark will use reasonable security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information, such as "firewalls," Secure Socket Layers (SSL), and other physical and electronic security measures where appropriate. However, you agree and acknowledge that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. Although we will take reasonable steps to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Site: any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information we will use reasonable procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.

**User Generated Content**  
Certain portions of our Site, such as our blogs and forums, permit user generated content. If you post content to our Site, all of the information that you post will be available to other persons visiting the Site. Your posting becomes public and we cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law, or your personal privacy.

**Questions and Updates**  
If you have any questions or suggestions about our privacy practices, please feel free to contact our Privacy Officer in writing at the address set out above or by email to the Privacy Officer at: [legal@landmarkworldwide.com](mailto:legal@landmarkworldwide.com). See Accessing and Changing Your Personally Identifiable Information.

If, after our Privacy Officer has reviewed and responded to your concern, you remain dissatisfied, you may wish to contact the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner for your local province or state.

This Privacy Policy is effective as of: 3/24/2017
