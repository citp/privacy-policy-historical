We at Landing Lion (Landing Lion, Inc. and our affiliates) are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to both our websites (Websites), including www.LandingLion.com and our Subscription Service (the Subscription Service). This Privacy Policy governs our data collection, processing and usage practices. By using the Websites or the Subscription Service, you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the data practices described in this Privacy Policy, you should not use the Websites or the Subscription Service. We periodically update this Privacy Policy. If you subscribe to the Subscription Service, then you will receive notice when this Privacy Policy is modified. The notice will be delivered through the Landing Lion portal used to access your Landing Lion subscription. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.

#### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting a new version online. You should check this page occasionally to review any changes. If we make any material changes we will notify you by posting the revised Privacy Policy on our Websites and, if you subscribe to our Subscription Service, providing notice through the Landing Lion portal used to access your Landing Lion subscription. Your review of the policy and updates to the policy helps you to always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, it is disclosed. Your continued use of the Websites, the Subscription Service, and/or continued provision of Personal Information to us will be subject to the terms of the then ­current Privacy Policy.

### Use of the Subscription Service by Landing Lion and our Customers

#### Landing Lion Subscription Service

Our online Subscription Service allows any company that uses it (our customers and Landing Lion itself) to build marketing webpages on our servers where visitors can learn more about the company, download content, and provide their contact information and other demographic information. This information, which is stored and managed on our service providers' servers, is then used so that the visitors can be contacted about their interest in the c ompany's goods or services and interact with the company. Landing Lion provides the Subscription Service to our customers for their own marketing and lead generation, we provide it to our other customers for their marketing and lead generation, and we use it on our Websites for our own marketing and lead generation.

#### Landing Lion as a data controller

If you are a registered Landing Lion user or a visitor to our website, we act as the ‘data controller’ of personal data. This means we determine how and why your data is processed.

#### Landing Lion as a data processor

As a Landing Lion user, Landing Lion is a processor of the data that you send to us about your users and visitors. To understand how Landing Lion operates with respect to the data you collect with it, think of Landing Lion (the platform) as your mailman.

When you use Landing Lion for your business, you are collecting data about your users (which may or may not be personal data) into your Landing Lion account, which is like your very own mailbox.  In the same way that your mailman doesn’t access the contents of your mail, Landing Lion doesn’t access the visitor data in your account for Landing Lion’s own purposes. You’ll work directly with your visitors to honor their requests about the data you have captured and stored about them whether it is in your Landing Lion account or not. We will help by providing resources that allow you to remove any data in your Landing Lion account at your visitor’s request. 

Because Landing Lion is a processor, you may need to obtain consent from your visitors for the way that you plan to use Landing Lion to process their data. If so, we suggest you be as clear as possible about how you use Landing Lion and why your visitors need to grant you consent to identify them for those purposes.  For example, if you use Landing Lion to gather data from a form, you should inform your visitors that you will be using this information for marketing or sales purposes. Make sure that each purpose needing consent is a separate checkbox that is unchecked by default.  We believe that being more descriptive about how you’re using your visitor’s data will improve the likelihood that they grant consent.

We use our own Subscription Service to build webpages that people can visit to learn more about Landing Lion. Information that we collect and manage using the Subscription Service for our own marketing belongs to us and is used, disclosed and protected according to this Privacy Policy.

Our users use the Subscription Service to build webpages that people can visit to learn more about their business. Landing Lion does not control the content of these webpages or the types of information that our users may choose to collect or manage using the Subscription Service; however, our users provide us with access to this information for our use and the use of other third parties with whom Landing Lion is affiliated subject to our agreement with the customer. Any information our users choose to collect and manage for their use is protected by them according to their privacy policies. Our agreements with our users prohibit them from using the Subscription Service to collect, manage, or process Sensitive Information. We are not responsible for our users' use of information they collect on the Subscription Service.

If you create a website or a landing page with Landing Lion you act as the ‘data controller’ of your visitor’s data.  Landing Lion is processing your visitor’s data on your behalf. This means that you determine how and why your visitor’s data is processed.

Sensitive Information is credit or debit card numbers, personal financial account information, Social Security numbers, passport numbers, driver's license numbers or similar personal identifiers, racial or ethnic origin, physical or mental health condition or information, or other employment, financial or health information.

What is session playback?

Session playback is an emulation of a user’s interactions on a webpage exactly or as close as possible to how the user actually experienced it. 

What does session playback capture?

Session playback captures interactions like mouse movements, clicks and scrolling on the webpage you create.

What does session playback not capture?

Session playback does not capture emails, names, and other contact information you enter into Landing Lion form fields. This means that the personal information visitors are typing into forms on your webpage are not captured in interaction data, preventing you from passively sending information about your visitors into our database.

We do not knowingly or intentionally collect information about children under 13 years of age and the Websites are not intended for or targeted at children under 13.
