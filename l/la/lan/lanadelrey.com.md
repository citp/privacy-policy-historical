**SECURITY AND PRIVACY POLICY**

YOUR PEACE OF MIND

Universal Music Operations Limited ("Universal") operates this website and respects the security and privacy concerns of users of this and all its websites. We are notified under the Data Protection Act 1998 and comply with the Act in all our dealings with your personal data. By using the website you agree to the terms of this privacy policy. As a general rule, no personal information (i.e. name, address, telephone number, e-mail address) is automatically collected from users of this website. However, there may be circumstances in which users voluntarily supply such information and in this event, any such information will be kept secure and confidential and will be used only for those purposes made known to users at the time the information is collected, or for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. We will also add your registered email address and personal details to our database if you register for updates from Universal Music via Facebook Connect. We follow strict security procedures for the storage and disclosure of information you have given us in order to prevent unauthorised access.

Personal information collected via this website is controlled by  
Universal Music Operations Limited,   
364-366 Kensington High Street,  
London,  
W14 8NS.

OUR USE OF INFORMATION AND PERSONAL DATA

The information collected is used to provide users with information on the relevant Universal Artist to customise the user's online experience and to improve the content of the website. Other uses of this information include the internal review of the web pages visited, tracking the progress and number of entries in promotions and contests, tracking the number of users of the site and where appropriate, product purchased through the site. Where users have signed up and opted in to receive information and promotions from us, the information may also be used to notify users of future Universal product releases and information on the artist concerned together with news on other Universal artists, related products and services which may be of interest to users. If at any time you wish to stop receiving information you can opt out or reply to the e-mail address at the bottom of each e-mail you receive from us. You can also opt out of any SMS communications you receive from us. Alternatively you can e-mail us at [info@umusic.com](mailto:info@umusic.com) and tell us what you would like us to do. As Universal Music is part of a worldwide group of companies, Universal Music may from time to time transfer data from the point of collection to a local Universal Music company located in another jurisdiction (including but not limited to Universal Music group companies located outside of the European Economic Area). Information will only be so transferred in circumstances where it is necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy or the purposes made known to users at the time information is collected. For example, if a user located in another jurisdiction signs up and opts in to receive information and promotions from us, Universal Music may transfer data to the local Universal Music company located in the user's jurisdiction which may contact the user with relevant information and promotions as described above. Communications may therefore come from local Universal Music companies, be in your local language and promote localised events/promotions. You will be given the opportunity to opt out of those local communications on any email you receive from them. Please note that any transfer of data to a Universal Music group company located outside of the European Economic Area shall be made in accordance with the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission as providing adequate protection for personal data and authorised by the Information Commissioner. No matter where your information is processed, this privacy policy will remain in effect. 

If you register for artist update via SMS to 82665 you will be registered for email and mobile updates. Please note this is a UK Only service. Texts are completely FREE to you with the exception of the initial registration text which will cost your standard network charge. To stop receiving text messages in the future all you have to do is text STOP [KEYWORD] to 82665 - the relevant keyword will have been given to you at initial registration and on any subsequent text messages.

THIRD PARY COOKIES

Some of the advertisements you see on this and some artist sites are generated by third parties. Some of these third parties generate their own "anonymous cookies" to track how many unique users have seen a particular ad, and how many times they have seen it. These third party cookies cannot be used to identify an individual user, but only for statistical purposes, for example, in providing you with advertisements that are more relevant to your interests. Additionally, the companies that generate these cookies have their own, very strict, privacy policies but we don't have access to these cookies; other than allowing them to be served, we have no role to play in these cookies at all (although we may use statistical information arising from these third party cookies and provided to us by third parties, to improve the targeting of advertisements to users). If you wish to block third party cookies, you can do so in your browser's security settings - indeed, the majority of browsers will block them by default.

FORUMS

While the administrators and moderators of our forums will attempt to remove or edit any generally objectionable material as quickly as possible, it is impossible to review every message. Therefore you must acknowledge that all posts made to these forums express the views and opinions of the author and not the administrators, moderators or webmaster (except for posts by these people) and hence will not be held liable.

We ask that you agree to not to post any abusive, obscene, vulgar, slanderous, hateful, threatening, sexually-oriented or any other material that may violate any applicable laws. Doing so may lead to you being immediately and permanently banned (and your service provider being informed). The IP address of all posts is recorded to aid in enforcing these conditions.

SHARING DATA WITH THIRD PARTIES WORKING ON BEHALF OF UNIVERSAL MUSIC

Universal Music works with a number of carefully selected third party companies that provide a broad range of online solutions, from traffic analysis and advertising to user experience enhancements, such as enabling you to use the same login details across multiple websites.

It is sometimes necessary for Universal Music to provide these companies with access to limited personal information about our users. In such cases Universal Music will share only the personal information required to for these companies to perform their functions and will not allow them to use this data for any other purposes. A selection of these third party companies include:

Comufy:  
Comufy is a service that enables Universal Music to communicate with fans of our artists via Facebook notifications. If you provide us with your Facebook ID, by registering for one of our mailing lists or websites using Facebook, or any other means, we may provide Comufy with your Facebook ID and/or email address to enable us to communicate with you about your requested artist via Facebook apps, notifications and other channels. If you do not wish to receive these notifications, please log into Facebook and set the notification permission setting of the Comufy app to 'Never'. You can find more information at [http://comufy.com](http://comufy.com/)

Janrain:  
Universal Music uses Janrain to provide single-sign-on functionality, social network integration and user analytics for a number of Universal Music websites and registration forms. This enables you to login to an artist website or register for artist updates by using your social media accounts such as a Facebook or Twitter account for example, rather than using an email address and password. If you do choose to use an email address and password, these credentials will allow you to access other Universal Music websites & forms as your unique ID will be stored via the Janrain login.

The Janrain platform collects personally identifiable information such as names and email addresses, demographic information, location and behavioral information in accordance with the preferences you gave when setting up your social account. Universal Music will also have access to the data collected by the Janrain system on our behalf while facilitating user interaction with our websites and other online properties, such as apps. This may include personal and behavioral data, such as which websites on the Universal Music network a specific user has visited and the properties a user has 'liked' on Facebook.

This data will be used as part of Universal Music's combined digital marketing strategy, which includes communication via email, SMS, social media and online advertising.

You can find more information at [http://janrain.com](http://janrain.com/)

Facebook:  
Facebook allows companies like Universal Music to target specific users with advertising campaigns across their service. To enable Facebook to identify these users it is necessary for us to provide them with a 'hashed' non personally identifiable fingerprint of your email. Facebook will be able to match your email address if they already exist in their database (because the fingerprints will be the same).

This data is sent to Facebook over a secure connection and compared with their user database. Any non-matches are ignored while matches will be made available to Universal Music for targeted advertising campaigns across the Facebook service. 

If we decide to include you in a list of users to be targeted with an advertising campaign on Facebook, we will use an interface managed by Facebook to hash your email before transmitting this to Facebook.

You can find more information about Facebook advertising here: <https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/advertising>
