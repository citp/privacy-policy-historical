[Unibake Home](https://web.archive.org/) > [Privacy & Cookies Policy](https://web.archive.org/Cookies/) 


## Introduction

Lantmännen ekonomisk förening and its Group companies(“ **Lantmännen** ” or “ **we** ”) process personal data about persons who visit and use our websites, mobile apps and social media platforms (“ **Digital Channels** ”) and about persons who participate in evaluations, campaigns or competitions organised by any of the companies within Lantmännen or who contact us in connection with customer issues.

This Privacy Policy describes how we process your personal data, what rights you have in connection with it, and what cookies we use in connection with our Digital Channels.

This version of the Privacy Policy has been modified for Lantmännen Unibakes digital channels. See the section “Lantmännen’s use of cookies” for details.

Your privacy is important to Lantmännen and we strive for a high level of protection in all our personal data processing. All personal data processing carried out within Lantmännen is performed in accordance with applicable data protection legislation. Within the EU/EEA, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies from 25 May 2018[[1]](file:///C:/Users/kendah01/Desktop/Lantm%C3%A4nnens%20privacy%20policy%20and%20information%20about%20cookies.docx#_ftn1). As most of Lantmännen’s companies are covered by European legislation, this policy is based on the GDPR. Local data protection legislation outside the EU/EEA will be taken into account where relevant.

Specific information regarding personal data processing might be provided in connection with Lantmännen’s Digital Channels, which, in such case, will take precedence over this general information.

## What is personal data?

Personal data means any information, which can be linked directly or indirectly when combined with other data, to a living natural person. This means that different types of information such as name and contact details, IP addresses, competition entries, purchase history, case information and photographs constitute personal data.

### What personal data do we collect about you?

_When you visit our Digital Channels_

When you visit or use our Digital Channels, we may collect data that you choose to submit to us, for example your name, postal address, e-mail address and phone number. We may also collect personal data through cookies as described under “Information about cookies - and how to avoid them” below.

_When you participate in competitions, other marketing activities, evaluations or tasting panels_

If you participate in competitions or other marketing activities organised by any of the companies within Lantmännen, competition entries and other necessary data about you (for example to administer prizes) will be processed. If you participate in an evaluation activity for any of Lantmännen’s products, your ratings and suggestions, as well as data on gender and age, will also be processed. If you participate in tasting panels, we will also process data regarding any food allergies you might have.

_When you are in contact with customer services or communicate with us in other ways_

When you communicate with us, for example, when you ask customer services something or if you have queries in connection with a complaint regarding a product, we may process case data, other than your contact details, such as customer number, complaints, requests and other data you provide about yourself while in contact with us.

## Purposes for which we process your personal data

  * To deliver services or products that you order and to administer our agreements with you;
  * To communicate with you and deal with your requests (e.g. handle returns/damages, complaints or comments etc.);

  * To administer events, competitions and prizes. Competition entries may be published during marketing;

## Legal basis for our personal data processing

Lantmännen always processes your personal data in accordance with applicable law. We process your personal data when necessary for the performance of a contract with you, to handle any complaints, or other types of customer service issues. We also process your personal data when we have another legitimate and justifiable interest to do so, for example an interest in marketing our company to visitors on our Digital Channels, an interest in developing our Digital Channels or in communicating with you (e.g. via customer services).

If Lantmännen was to process your personal data for any purpose, which requires your consent under applicable data protection legislation, we will obtain your consent in advance.

### Erasure

Lantmännen will only process your personal data for as long as necessary in order to fulfil the purposes of the processing. We have procedures in place to ensure that your data are erased thereafter.

Security for the protection of personal data

### Restrictions on disclosure of personal data

Lantmännen may appoint external partners to perform tasks on Lantmännen’s behalf, such as providing IT services or helping with marketing, data analysis or statistics. The performance of these services may mean that Lantmännen’s partners, both within and outside the EU/EEA, gain access to your personal data. Companies that manage personal data on Lantmännen’s behalf must always sign an agreement with Lantmännen so that we are able to ensure a high level of protection of your personal data also with our partners. Lantmännen takes special safeguards with regard to partners outside the EU/EEA, such as signing agreements that include the standardised model clauses for data transfer adopted by the EU Commission and which are available on the EU Commission’s website.

Lantmännen may also disclose your personal data to third parties, for example the police or other public authorities, if it concerns criminal investigations or if we are otherwise required to disclose such data by law or public authority decisions.

Lantmännen will not disclose your personal data to any extent other than described in this section.
