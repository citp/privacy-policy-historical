Our reputation and integrity is directly related to how we serve our clients, customers and visitors. Below, please find below a description of how LandAndFarm.com strives to protect the privacy of Internet users, and maintain the Internet as a highly credible medium for all to enjoy.

**  
User Information (Searching)**

All users who view listings on LandAndFarm.com retain complete anonymity where LandAndFarm.com is concerned. As the listings appear in your web browser, LandAndFarm.com does not acquire or collect any personal information about you. Your name, address, phone number, and email address all remain your private properties. LandAndFarm.com does, however, collect information which is specific to how you use the Internet. LandAndFarm.com servers note details such as the server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, and your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of targeting listings and measuring the effectiveness of listings on geographically-based groups of clients and customers.

  
**Registration Information (Listing)**

LandAndFarm.com regards all personal information collected from its registered partners as completely confidential, except for those items that appear in the listings, such as Name, Address, Email Address, and Phone Numbers. All other personal data provided during registration processes and financial account information (credit card / bank information) is kept strictly private. In other words, LandAndFarm.com does not sell its registration lists to third parties or allow those lists to be used internally to create unwanted messages to its members. Such activities are immoral and wrong, and LandAndFarm.com has never condoned such activities.

When you first enter LandAndFarm.com, we may set a cookie in your browser to help let us know how many times you come back to visit or which pages you consistently visit. We want to make sure that we meet the needs of our clients and users, and this information helps let us know which areas we need to emulate or improve. This information is never shared with third-parties, and your personal identity is never tracked, just the use of your browser. If you don't want to be tracked on the site, please use your browser's configuration area to disallow the use of cookies, as most browsers have cookies turned on by default.
