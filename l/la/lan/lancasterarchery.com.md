_Privacy Statement _

At Lancaster Archery Supply we understand that privacy is an important issue for visitors to the Lancaster Archery Supply Web site ([www.LancasterArchery com)](http://www.lancasterarchery%20com%29/). The following information is designed to help visitors understand what information we gather from our site, and how we handle the information once we gather it.

**Information Collection and Use**

In general, there are two types of information collected over the Internet: personally identifiable information and anonymous information. Personally identifiable information refers to that information that is unique to an individual, such as a name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. Anonymous information is information typically collected in aggregate for statistical purposes, with no reference to personally identifiable information pertaining to the visitors of the site.  All personal information that you provide on this site will be kept confidential. Lancaster Archery Supply will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.

**Security**

When visitors submit information to Lancaster Archery Supply through one of our online forms, SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption technology is utilized to protect the information they submit. This technology protects visitors from having their information used by others since it is not readable due to the encryption protection.

Lancaster Archery Supply works hard to ensure that our systems are secure and that they meet industry standards. Where appropriate, we employ firewalls, encryption technology, use authentication systems (e.g., passwords and personal identification numbers) and access control mechanisms to control access to systems and data.

If you do obtain a password or personal identification number from us, you should not share that information with others. If Lancaster Archery Supply becomes aware that a visitor to a Lancaster Archery Supply Web site is determined to have logged in as another user in order to gain access to personal and confidential information, this would be considered a breach of security. Lancaster Archery Supply reserves the right to terminate access for a user’s login if a breach has been determined.

Please note that your e-mail is a non-encrypted form of Internet communication and may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users without your knowledge or permission while in transit to us. Please exercise caution when using e-mail to communicate any information that you consider confidential.

**Hyperlinks**

This Web site contains hyperlinks or “links” to other sites, and other sites may “link” to this site. Web sites linking to and from this site may have different privacy practices from the ones described here for [www.LancasterArchery.com](http://www.lancasterarchery.com/).  We encourage visitors to our site to read the privacy statements of other Web sites they visit. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site and we are not responsible for the privacy of your information shared with other Web sites.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user.  Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.  Cookies are required to gain access to secured areas of the site, and can be a convenience by limiting the need for the user to enter duplicate information as they advance from page to page through the site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Sharing**

We may also share this aggregated data with our partners for marketing and promotional purposes. As a general rule, we do not disclose any information that contains personally identifiable information about you to any third party without your permission. However, we may use your information to contact you directly with newsletters, site enhancement notices, etc. In compliance with the CAN SPAM Act, you can elect to opt out of receiving such communications from Lancaster Archery Supply.

**Surveys**

From time-to-time our site may request information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Each survey offered will contain a statement disclosing the purpose and use of the survey information. Please read this disclosure before proceeding with any survey.

**Site and Service Updates**

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email where provided. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. If a user chooses not to have their information available under different circumstances, we will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
