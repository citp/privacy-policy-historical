tags to collect information and store your online preferences. Cookies are widely used and most browsers are set up to   
accept them automatically. If you would prefer, you can choose to not accept cookies.

we may use marketing segments developed by us or other companies to customize certain services to your local area   
and provide relevant Land-FX offers tailored to you.

**Personal Information**

In addition to the information described in the previous section, we may also gather personal information that you   
provide to us such as your name, address, phone number, and email. Collecting this personal information enables us to   
offer you online experiences that help you with your financial needs. For example, we collect personal information   
when you are:

If you've enrolled in Land-FX services, such as online bill payment, we collect personal information about your transactions,   
and how you interact with third parties such as those you pay like a utility company or phone company.   
Collecting this information enables us to provide you these services. You can refer to the terms and conditions for your   
account or service to learn how your information is collected and used.

combination with the information that Land-FX has collected online. We can use this information to better tailor and   
personalize our service and marketing communications with you, both online and offline.

The personal information you provide online is held by the Land-FX business that maintains your account or is processing   
your application for a new product or service. You can access and/or change information in connection with your account   
or application by logging on to your account online or telephoning customer service.

Land-FX uses the information we collect about and from you to manage our business and to offer an enhanced,   
personalized online experience on our site and third-party websites.

3\. How Do We Use Information from Our Advertisements on Other Websites?

Companies we work with place and track advertisements on third-party websites.  
Like most advertisers, we place advertisements where we think they will be most relevant to customers.   
We place advertisements by developing and using our own marketing segments that may combine online and offline   
information about our current and prospective customers. In addition, we may use marketing segments provided by   
online publishers and network advertising companies.

Network advertising companies that provide these services have their own privacy policies and are not subject to our   
Online Privacy Statement. Many of these companies provide ways to avoid targeted advertising provided by, or thru,   
them.

It's important to note that the information we use about you helps us provide you with products, services and   
experiences that benefit you. You have the ability to control how your non-personal information is collected and used   
online.
