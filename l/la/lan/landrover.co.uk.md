#### 5\. INFORMATION ABOUT INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS.

The Jaguar Land Rover UK websites use servers which are hosted in the EU. However we may share website personal data with suppliers or group companies located outside of the EU where this is necessary for the purposes described above. Where this happens, we apply safeguards to add to the data protections that apply to those data transfers. This includes an assessment of the adequacy of the third country in question, use of European Commission approved model contract terms where appropriate, and assessment of Privacy Shield certification for US located entities where applicable. 

**TELL ME MORE ...

...about the adequacy checks JLR puts in place for international data transfers...

**

Where JLR chooses to share personal data with a third party located outside the EU, the following factors are assessed to support adequate transfer of this data:

  * **Internal checks to identify the existence or absence of any adequacy decision by the European Commission.** We have group companies, and use suppliers located in countries that have been approved by the European Commission as having essentially equivalent data protection laws. A full list of these countries as at the date of this Privacy Policy is: Andorra, Argentina, Canada, Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Switzerland, Jersey, New Zealand, Uruguay and the Isle of Man. (The European Commission has also approved as adequate the EU-US Privacy Shield programme – this is described below). This list and information about the protections the European Commission has considered is available via [this link](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en).
  * **Use of measures like European Commission approved measures to support adequate transfers of personal data.** We also have group companies, and use suppliers located in countries that are elsewhere in the world. To manage data protection compliance with these transfers, we will use European Commission approved data transfer mechanisms such as use of model contractual clauses approved by the Commission. We will also assess where applicable where a supplier is able to demonstrate to us they have Binding Corporate Rules. (Binding Corporate Rules is a GDPR – recognised Data Protection mechanism to ensure adequate personal data transfers). We may work with suppliers who are able to demonstrate to us they are Privacy Shield certified. 
    * To understand the protections required in European Commission approved Model Clauses, a template copy of these [is accessible from this location.](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en)
    * To see a full list of approved Binding Corporate Rules, [please click this link](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/binding-corporate-rules_en).
    * A full list of Privacy Shield participants, and their Privacy Shield certification information is available from [this website link](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome).

We will keep your personal data for as long as we need it to provide the products and services you have signed up to. We may also keep it to comply with our legal obligations, respond to queries and resolve any disputes, to meet our legitimate interests and to enforce our rights.
