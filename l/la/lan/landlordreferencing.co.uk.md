# Landlord Referencing Services Privacy Policy | LandlordReferencing.co.uk

### **Our commitment to your privacy**

At Landlord Referencing Services we are committed to protecting your privacy and we comply with the data protection laws applicable to the United Kingdom. This Privacy Policy outlines how your personal information is treated and forms part of our Conditions of Use.

### **What information do we collect and how do we use it?**

We will not collect any personal information about you unless you have chosen to give it to us. If you require further information, wish to open an account or would like to contact us, we may ask for your name, address, e-mail address and telephone number so that we can contact you accordingly.

When you instruct us to carry our work we need to may need to know your name, e-mail address, delivery and billing addresses, credit or debit card number and the expiry date (if applicable). This allows us to process and fulfil your work and carry out credit checking. We also ask for your telephone number, which enables us to contact you urgently if there is a problem with your request.

We may use the information provided by you to communicate with you, to provide a more personalised online experience, for record keeping purposes, and in aggregate (and therefore anonymously) for market research purposes, to track activity on our site, to publish trends and/or to improve usefulness and content. We may also use the information we collect to keep you updated with information about promotional offers and what is coming soon at Landlord Referencing Services. If you do not wish to receive this information please let us know.

We may use other companies to provide services on our behalf. These services may include but are not limited to packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customers questions about products or services, sending postal mail and e-mails, analysing data and processing credit or debit card payments. We will only provide those companies with the information they need to deliver the service and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. We may undertake a search with a licensed credit reference agency for the purposes of verifying your identity and the details you have submitted before accepting or despatching your order. The credit reference agency may check the details you supply against any particulars on any database (public or otherwise) that they have access to. They may also use your details in the future to assist other companies for verification purposes. A record of the search will be retained.

**We never make your personal details available to companies outside Landlord Referencing Services for marketing purposes.**

### **How is customer information protected?**

Ordering online is protected by a secure server. The secure server uses industry-standard SSL encryption that encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. We recommend you use an up to date internet browser which supports 128-bit encryption. Use of an out of date browser or one that does not support 128-bit encryption may compromise the level of security we are able to provide. Internally, we restrict access to personal information. Only employees who need the information in order to do their jobs have access to it.
