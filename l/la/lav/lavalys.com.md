# Privacy Policy | Lavalys.com

[](http://www.aida64.com/ "AIDA64 the successor to EVEREST")

This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Lavalys, Inc. ("Lavalys") concerning the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information. Lavalys receives such information through our various web sites, services, software and third-parties ("Services"). When using any of our Services, you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information:

**Personal Information** \- Some of our Services require you to provide some personal information which we store securely on our servers. This information may include your name, email address, username and password, amongst other things. 

**Log Data** \- Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of our Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type and language, pages visited, search terms, referring domain, and the date and time of your request. 

**Cookies** \- Like many websites, we use cookies to collect additional usage data in order to better understand how you interact with our Services and continually improve them. A "cookie" is a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your Internet browser. Most browsers automatically accept cookies but generally provide a mechanism to stop accepting them or to prompt you before accepting one that is being sent. We do not require cookies for many parts of our Services but some features may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

If we propose to use your personal information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected and/or for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy, we will ask for your prior consent and offer you an effective way to opt out. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent.

We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us. We may share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to obligations mirroring the protections of this Privacy Policy.

## Information Security and Integrity

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We also take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we store is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary. 

Access to personal information is restricted to our employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to disciplinary measures, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

## Our Policy Towards Children

Our Services are not directed to people under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at [privacy@lavalys.com](mailto:privacy@lavalys.com). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will automatically delete such information.

## Changes to this Policy

Please note that we may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of this Privacy Policy will govern our use of your information and will always be available at [http://www.lavalys.com/company/privacy](https://web.archive.org/web/20130806043159id_/http://www.lavalys.com/company/privacy/index.html "http://www.lavalys.com/company/privacy"). If we make a significant change to this policy, in our sole discretion, we will notify you via email to the address we have on record. By continuing to access or use our Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
