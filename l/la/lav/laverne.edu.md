#### Purpose

The University of La Verne (La Verne) is committed to ensuring the privacy and accuracy of your confidential information. La Verne does not share personal information gathered from its Web servers. However, some information collected from La Verne Web sites, including the summary server log information and e-mails sent to Web sites may be used for marketing and recruitment purposes.

As part of its commitment to maintain the privacy of its Web users, La Verne has developed this privacy statement. The statement has two purposes:

  1. To educate users about privacy issues
  2. To inform users about specific privacy policies and guidelines employed at La Verne.



La Verne also complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which prohibits the release of education records without student permission. Although FERPA regulations apply only to La Verne students, the University is equally committed to protecting the privacy of all visitors to our Web sites.

#### Scope

La Verne owns, controls, operates and/or maintains Web sites under a number of domains. This Web Privacy Policy applies to all domains used by the University.

#### Exceptions

This University Web Privacy policy supersedes any departmental Web Privacy policies. Departmental Web Privacy policies must be approved by the Office of Information Technology and must be posted on this site.

The La Verne Web site contains links to external Web sites. The University is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of the external Web sites we link to.

#### Information Gathered by La Verne

La Verne Web servers generate temporary logs that may contain the following information:

  * Internet address (IP address) of computer being used
  * Web pages requested
  * Referring Web page
  * Browser/OS used
  * Date and Time



This data is used by our Marketing & Publications Department to refine the Web site for more efficient use and is not associated with specific visitors. Raw data from the Web server logs is only shared with Marketing and the content managers of each Web site for the betterment of the site. Summary reports produced from the logs help us determine what Web browsers and pages are most popular.

_Third-party content_

Some pages may contain content served from external third parties; for example, a script from a third party. La Verne does not transmit information to these third parties. However, when you visit pages that contain third party content, information such as your IP address, date, browser, and requested page are transmitted from your computer to that third party. La Verne is not responsible for the privacy practices of external third parties.

_Cookies_

Cookies are small pieces of data stored by the Web browser. Cookies are used to remember information about preferences and pages you have visited. The first time you visited the site a cookie may have been set on your computer. When you return, the cookie is read again. You can configure your Web browser to refuse to accept cookies, to disable cookies, and to remove cookies.

Some Web servers within La Verne may also use cookies to retain user preference information. It is against University policy to share this information with external third parties.

_Security and Accuracy of Confidential Information_

La Verne does its best to ensure the personal information we have about you is accurate. Although no computer system is 100% secure, La Verne has extensive security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information.

_E-commerce_

Some sites within La Verne enable you to pay for products or services online with a credit card. Unless otherwise noted, these transactions are encrypted. It is University policy that confidential information you enter in the transaction is used only for the purposes described in that transaction, unless an additional use is specifically stated on that site.

#### Sharing of Information

Consistent with FERPA, we do not release personal student information, other than public directory information, to other parties unless we receive explicit written authorization to do so. La Verne students can read more about FERPA and student privacy in the University's catalog. Enrolled students can restrict release of their directory information by contacting the Office of the Registrar.

_Public Forums_

La Verne may make use o public chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups and other social networking mediums. The University does not log chat sessions, however, any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should therefore exercise caution when deciding to disclose your confidential information in such places.

Academic chat sessions and discussion forums, such as those in Blackboard, may be logged. However, these educational records are protected from disclosure by FERPA.

_Online Surveys_

It is University policy that confidential information gathered in online surveys is used only for the research purposes indicated in the survey. Unless otherwise noted on the specified survey, your answers are confidential and individual responses will not be shared with other parties,

#### Questions

If you have questions about this privacy statement or you believe that your personal information has been misused or released without your consent, send an e-mail to [web@ulv.edu](mailto:web@ulv.edu).

The authoritative source on this policy and responsibility for its implementation rests with the Chief Information Officer, who can be reached at [cio@ulv.edu](mailto:cio@ulv.edu).
