# LauchLab.co.uk Privacy Policy

At LaunchLab co.uk we may from time to time collect different types of information about our users.  This information may be used for the following:

1\. As part of our ongoing site improvement, seeing how our users navigate through the site and what content they visit helps us to focus our future development work.

2\. To provide personalised services or content unique to individual users.

3\. To assist us in selling advertising space on the site. No individual data is used in this process, rather information such as the total number of users, geographical distribution, etc.  It does not mean sharing an individual's details with an advertiser. Where we collect registration information from an individual, we will never share that individual's information with a third party, including an advertiser, without that user's explicit permission.

We take your privacy seriously.  We will never share your information with others without your prior consent.

In support of our core privacy policy we have agreed the following:

1\. We will invest in current security protection measures for any part of the site where financial details are requested.

2\. We will not send unsolicited marketing mail from us and/or from third parties screened by Point & Fire Media Ltd. unless you have agreed to this. We will, however, mail you occasionally with information or queries about your registration, your subscription account or postings, for example, with reminders, warnings or copyright requests.

3\. We will not pass on any individual user details (including your email address) for third party use unless we have your prior consent.

4\. We always ensure that contractors we use in connection with the running of the website and services (for example hosting providers) are subject to strict contractual obligations. They are only able to process data on our behalf and in accordance with our principles and instructions and not for any other independent purpose.

5\. We will only share anonymous aggregate statistics about our users, sales and traffic patterns with our advertisers.

Should we elect to change our privacy policy we will post the changes here. Where the changes are significant, we may also choose to email all our registered users with the new details.

Please note that we reserve the right to access and disclose individually identifiable information to comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests, to operate our systems properly and to protect both ourselves and our users.

Any data processors with access to your data in providing services on our behalf are subject to contractual restrictions to ensure that your data is protected, and not used independently by such third party.
