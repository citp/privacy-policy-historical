            Your Privacy Classification<br>
            This policy classifies those accessing and using our Services as one of the following:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    VISITORS: Individuals and entities that access and interact with our Websites (for instance, to read about Cvent products and services, download a white paper, or sign up for an online demo), as well as those whom we meet or learn about through referral, from third parties or other external sources, are referred to as “Website Visitors” or simply “Visitors.” &nbsp;Personally identifiable information pertaining to Visitors subject to this policy is maintained in one or more Cvent marketing databases and Website analytics and management systems that are physically and logically separate from Cvent production systems and databases where Application end-user information is maintained.&nbsp; Cvent may use the contact information you provide as a Visitor to send you promotional materials, as further described in this policy.</li>
                <li>
                    CUSTOMERS: Individuals and entities that are Cvent’s direct customers (for example, event planners, meeting space providers, live event venues, and corporate marketing departments) as well as customer personnel that are assigned a login id and are authorized to access and use our Applications, pursuant to an active Cvent services agreement, or under a temporary evaluation license if available, are referred to as “Customers.” &nbsp;<strong>Personally identifiable</strong> <strong>information of Customer personnel associated with their Application accounts is treated as End-User information, and will not be used for any purpose other than providing and supporting our Applications (other than for limited exceptions described in the section below titled “<em>How We Use Information</em>” where applicable).</strong>&nbsp; Note that information relating to these same individuals who have visited and interacted with our marketing Websites (for instance, to download a white paper or sign up for an online demo) is treated as Visitor information.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>
                    END-USERS: Customers’ business contacts, which may include their own current and prospective customers, members, marketing partners, or other third party contacts that use our Applications to interact with our Customers (for example, individuals that register for an event organized by a Customer, download an event-related mobile app, complete an online survey, or purchase tickets to a live event) are referred to as “Application End-Users” or simply “End-Users.”&nbsp; <strong>Cvent does not use personally identifiable information of End-Users for any purpose other than providing and supporting the Applications (other than for limited exceptions described in the section below titled “<em>How We Use Information</em>” where applicable).&nbsp; </strong></li>
            </ul>
            &nbsp;<br>
            <h2>Information We Collect and How We Collect It</h2><br>
            Cvent, and our Customers that use our Applications to organize and manage meetings and events or to provide other services, may collect several types of information from and about End-Users, including:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” that identifies an End-User as an individual or relates to an identifiable person.&nbsp; For example, this includes name, organization, title, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, social media account ID or other identifiers by which End-Users may be contacted online or offline.&nbsp; This also may include information that permits End-Users to purchase products or services from Cvent or from our customers through the Applications, such as credit or debit card number, or other payment account number, as well as applicable expiration dates and billing/shipping addresses;</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    “<strong>Other Information</strong>” that does not reveal a person’s identity or directly relate to an individual, on its own or in combination with other information we have collected, such as browser and device information, app usage data, information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies, general geographic location, demographic information and other information provided by a person, such as dietary preferences, interests, activities, age, gender, education and occupation.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            Cvent may also collect Personal Information and Other Information from Customers and Website Visitors.&nbsp; In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information (such as combining a Website Visitor’s name with information we gather about this individual’s use of the Websites).&nbsp; If we combine any Other Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.<br>
            We collect this information:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Directly from individuals when they provide it to us.</li>
                <li>
                    Automatically from End-Users as they use the Applications, or from Website Visitors as they navigate through the Websites, using technologies described in the section below titled “<em>Third Party Advertisers and Analytics</em>.”&nbsp; Information collected automatically may include browser and device information, details regarding use of the Services, IP addresses and information collected through cookies, web beacons and other technologies.</li>
                <li>
                    From third party sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, and social media platforms.&nbsp; For example, if a Website Visitor elects to connect his social media account to his account for our Websites, certain Personal Information from the social media account will be shared with us, which may include Personal Information that is part of the Visitor’s profile or his friends’ profiles.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Information Provided to Us</h2><br>

                <li>

                    Records of search queries on our Services.</li>
            </ul>
            Some of our Websites allow Visitors to create or post content on message boards, chat, profile pages and blogs and other services to which Visitors are able to post information and materials.&nbsp; Please note that any information posted or disclosed through these sections of our Websites will become public information, and may be available to other Website Visitors and to the general public.&nbsp; We urge caution to anyone deciding to disclose their Personal Information, or any other information, on our Websites. &nbsp;<br>

            &nbsp;<br>
            This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including any non-customer third party operating any site or service to which the Services link.&nbsp; The inclusion of a link on the Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates.<br>

            <h2>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2><br>
            We and our service providers may collect information about Website Visitors online activities over time and across our Websites, third-party websites or other online services, and we may collect similar information about the online activities of Customers and End-Users within our Applications.&nbsp; As you navigate through and interact with our Websites and Applications, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns, including:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Details of your visits to our Services, such as the date and time you access our Services, length of time you spend on our Services, websites you visited before or after our Services, the resources and content that you access and use on the Services, and whether your interaction with our Services results in your requesting information about Cvent or making a purchase.</li>
                <li>
                    Information about your computer and internet connection, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, language, Internet browser type and version and the name and version of the Services (such as the Application) you are using.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cookies (or browser cookies).</strong> &nbsp;A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer.&nbsp; You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser.&nbsp; However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access or receive certain parts of our Services.&nbsp; Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Websites or receive our Services.&nbsp; For more information about cookies and how to disable them, see <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.com">www.allaboutcookies.com</a>.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Session Cookies and Persistent Cookies. &nbsp;</strong>A “session” cookie lasts for a single browser session only and is deleted when the user closes the web browser. &nbsp;A “persistent” cookie remains on the user’s device (even while powered off) until it expires or is deleted. &nbsp;A persistent cookie will be reactivated when a user returns to the website which posted the cookie. Cookies cannot read or access other cookies or any data from a user’s hard drive. &nbsp;Cookies alone will not personally identify a user, however a cookie may recognize a user’s individual web browser or device through an IP Address, browser version, operating system and other information, and end users of our Services who log in to their Cvent accounts may be individually identifiable to particular Services using session cookies.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Flash Cookies. </strong>&nbsp;Certain features of our Services may use local storage, such as “Flash cookies” to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from and on our Websites. &nbsp;Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies. &nbsp;For information about managing your privacy and security settings for Flash cookies, see <em>Choices about How We Use and Disclose Your Information</em>.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Web Beacons.</strong> &nbsp;Pages on our Services and our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs). &nbsp;Web beacons differ from cookies in that the information is not stored on your hard drive, but invisibly embedded on web pages or in email. &nbsp;Web beacons permit us to track online movements of web users -- for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an e-mail and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).&nbsp; This enables Cvent to provide a website experience more tailored to your preferences and interests.</li>
            </ul>
            At this time we do not respond to browser ‘do not track’ signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted.&nbsp; You can learn about how you can adjust your browser’s settings to limit or disable cookies and other tracking technologies by visiting the section below titled “<em>Choices about How We Use and Disclose Your Information</em>.”<br>
            <h2>Advertising and Analytics</h2><br>
            When you access and use the Services and other websites, we may serve you advertisements regarding goods and services that may be of interest to you (or in some cases, to users who our service providers deem to have characteristics similar to our customers) based on information relating to your access to and use of the Services and other websites.&nbsp; To do so, we or our service providers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (alone or in conjunction with web beacons, pixel tags or other tracking technologies).&nbsp; If you would like more information about this practice and to learn about your choices in connection with these practices, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a> and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">http://www.aboutads.info/</a>.&nbsp;<br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            We use Facebook Custom Audiences to deliver advertisements to Website Visitors on Facebook based on email addresses that we have collected.&nbsp; You may learn more about Facebook Custom Audiences by visiting <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/381385302004628/">https://www.facebook.com/help/381385302004628/</a>, and you may learn how to opt-out of receiving advertisements from Cvent based on your email address by visiting the section below titled “<em>Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information</em>.”&nbsp; We also may use information associated with Visitor social media accounts, such as demographic and other information about an individual’s title, industry or organization, to improve our marketing efforts if that individual connects those social media accounts to a Website profile.<br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            We may use the information we have collected from you to enable us to display advertisements from our Customers to their target audience of users. &nbsp;As one example, meeting space providers may purchase advertisements which are presented selectively through the Cvent Supplier Network to meeting planners who have previously awarded a minimum volume of meetings business to that provider or to competing venues in the target metropolitan area.&nbsp; Even though we do not disclose Personal Information for these purposes, if an End-User clicks on or otherwise interacts with an advertisement, the advertising Customer may assume that the End-User meets its target criteria.<br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            We use third party analytics providers, including Quantcast, Google, Adobe, Mixpanel, Mouseflow and others, to collect information about your use of the Services and enable us to improve how the Services work. &nbsp;The information allows us to see the overall patterns of usage on the Services, helps us record any difficulties you have with the Services, shows us whether our advertising is effective or not, and allows us to use responses to advertisements to optimize ad performance.&nbsp; Google Analytics, Adobe and Mixpanel use cookies and other, similar technologies to collect information about the Services use and to report website trends to us, without identifying individual End-Users or Visitors to us.&nbsp; See below for more information, or to opt out of these practices:<br>

            <h2>Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information</h2><br>
            We strive to provide you with choices regarding the Personal Information you provide to us. &nbsp;We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tracking Technologies and Advertising. </strong>&nbsp;You may set your web browser to restrict or to entirely block cookies, to configure cookie notification settings and/or to delete cookies already present on the browser or device.&nbsp; Information on how to do this should be provided in the web browser’s help/reference section. &nbsp;Visitors who block cookies may be able to access a Website but will not be able to use most of the content, applications and services available on that site. &nbsp;Limiting or restricting certain types of cookies may also prevent a Customer or End-User from using certain portions of the Applications, depending on how the browser settings are configured. &nbsp;For example, event registration cannot be completed successfully if cookies are disabled in an End-User’s web browser.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Promotional Offers from Cvent.</strong> &nbsp;If you do not wish for Cvent to use your email address to send you promotional messages, or would like us to prevent a Customer from using the Applications to send you emails to promote its own or third parties’ products or services, you can (i) opt-out by checking the relevant box located on the form on which your data is collected (or, in some jurisdictions, by failing to opt-in), (ii) adjust your email preferences on the profile page which is accessible by clicking the unsubscribe link provided at the bottom of emails you receive from us (or from our Customer), or (iii) at any other time by sending an email stating your request to <a href="mailto:abuse@cvent.com">abuse@cvent.com</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will try to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable.&nbsp; Please also note that if you, as a Website Visitor or Customer, opt-out of receiving marketing-related emails from us (or as an End-User opt-out of receiving marketing-related emails from one of our Customers), we may still send you important administrative messages, and you cannot opt-out from receiving administrative messages.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Adobe Flash technology (including Flash Local Shared Objects (“Flash LSO”) and other similar technologies.&nbsp; </strong>We may use Flash LSOs and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Services. &nbsp;If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel available at <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html</a>.&nbsp; You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel, available at <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html</a>, and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as “information” on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).&nbsp; Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the Services or our online content.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Accessing and Correcting Your Information</h2><br>
            If you are a registered user of one of our Services, you can review and change your Personal Information and/or email marketing preferences by logging into the Services and visiting your account profile page. &nbsp;For example:<br>

                <li>
                    Users of our Event Management application may update or correct their Personal Information, other profile settings and user preferences by using the User Profile Manager within the “My Account” section of the App.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>
                    Users of CrowdCompass mobile applications can update or correct their Personal Information or other profile information, using the Online Event Guide or within the native mobile application. &nbsp;Users who have opted to join an event attendee list (visible to other users of the mobile application for that event) have the option to later hide themselves from the list if desired.</li>
            </ul>
            You may also send us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:customercare@cvent.com">customercare@cvent.com</a> to request access to, correct or delete any Personal Information that you have provided to us. &nbsp;In your request, please make clear what Personal Information you would like to have changed, whether you would like to have your Personal Information that you have provided to us suppressed from our database or otherwise let us know what limitations you would like to put on our use of your Personal Information that you have provided to us.&nbsp; For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request.&nbsp; We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.&nbsp; We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.<br>
            Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the Personal Information provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion).&nbsp; There may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed.<br>
