This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Launchmetrics on the collection, use and disclosure of your information, and what choices you have with respect to the information. 

Launchmetrics is Controller of the personal data that you provide us. The terms « Launchmetrics », « us » or « our » mean the Fashion GPS Europe, Ltd. entity. In accordance with the applicable legislation on data protection, Launchmetrics is the Controller. 

We receive information about you from various sources, including: (i) certain contact information and other information about yourself when you make an inquiry on the website, and (ii) your use of the website generally. When you make an inquiry or otherwise use the website, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

Our Privacy Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access our websites.

Updates in this version of the Privacy Policy reflect changes in data protection laws. In addition, we have worked to make the Privacy Policy clearer and more understandable.

Please read this statement carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. 

## **What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?**

This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personal data (“ **Personal Data** ”) gathered when you are using or accessing launchmetrics.com (the “ **Site** ”) and other interactions (e.g., customer services inquiries, newsletter, etc.).

This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Data that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications (“ **Third Party Services** ”) that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access. 

Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Launchmetrics and its affiliates, but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.

Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.

## **What Information Do We Collect and Receive?**

The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Site. In connection with certain aspects of the Site, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Data. We collect the following types of information from our users:

**Usage Information:**

  * **IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically.  **We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Site, including your IP address and Cookie information. Generally, the Site automatically collects usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Site so that we can analyze and improve them.
  * **Log Data.  **We do not have website “logs” as our Site is totally open. You will need to leave Personal Data only for downloading content or for request of information on our Site. A checkbox will be available on every online form you complete to make sure you consent to give us such Personal Data.
  * **Device Identifiers.**  When you access the Site by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a universally unique identifier. Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by us. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Site. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Site. Some features of the Site and Site may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
  * **Location Data**. When you access the Site by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Site and Site. Some features of the Site, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.
  * **Aggregate Information**. We collect statistical information about how, collectively, users use the Site (“Aggregate Information”). Some of this information is derived from Personal Data. This statistical information cannot be tied back to you or your web browser.



**** **Cookies Information:**

We use Cookies and similar technologies in our Sites and Services that help us collect other information. The Sites and Services may also include Cookies and similar tracking technologies of third parties, which may collect information about you via the Sites and Services and across other websites and online services. For more details about how we use these technologies, please see our [Cookies Policy](https://www.launchmetrics.com/cookie-policy).

**Contact Information:** **  
**

If you submit an inquiry through the Site, we may collect Personal Data such as your first and last name, your current job and employer, your email address and telephone number and the country where you are currently located. Before you submit an inquiry containing contact information you will be asked to tick a checkbox so we are sure that you understand the reason why we may collect such information and you will also be provided with a link to this Privacy Policy. 

In order to improve the type of content you receive through our subscription channels, we use in our contact & content forms a feature that is called ‘Progressive Profiling’. It is the tool we use for marketing automation and it records your visit through Session Cookies. Once your IP is identified, the type of information that we ask you through our forms may vary when you access or download content two or more times on our website. In this way, your profile in our CRM platform is progressively enriched and allows us to offer you a unique and personalized experience through our emails according to your profile and interests.

When you submit an inquiry, you will always be asked for permission before we send **marketing communication** (e.g. newsletters and Discover coverage newsletter, campaign emails, etc). If you DO NOT wish anymore to receive marketing communication from us, please send us an email:[dataprotection@launchmetrics.com](mailto:dataprotection@launchmetrics.com) or directly unsubscribe from marketing communication by clicking on the unsubscribe link. 

You are free to explore the Site without providing any Personal Data about yourself but some information may be collected automatically, and if some information, such as account details, is not provided, we may be unable to provide the Services.

To avoid features such as the ‘Progressive Profiling’ of our forms, you can always perform your browsing in incognito mode (more info [here](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en))  or deactivate your browser Cookies (Check our [Cookies Policy ](https://www.launchmetrics.com/cookie-policy)[here](https://www.launchmetrics.com/cookie-policy)).

## **How Do We Use the Data Collected?**

Your Personal Data will be used by Launchmetrics in accordance with your instructions, including any applicable terms in agreements and use of Services functionality, and as required by Applicable Laws. Your Personal Data include the data communicated by you when using the forms on the site.

Different Launchmetrics entities provide the Services in different parts of the world. Data protection laws in certain jurisdictions differentiate between the “controller” and “processor” of information. 

Launchmetrics is the data controller of the data processing involving your Personal Data collected through our Site. The purpose of this data processing is to provide you with our Services and to facilitate your navigation on our website as explained below.

We use the Personal Data you provide to us to:

  * Enable us to provide you with the Services and information offered through the Site and which you request;
  * Analyse use of the Site and the people visiting in order to improve our content and services including research into our users’ demographics;
  * Facilitate your navigation of our Site;
  * Send you information we think you may find useful or which you have requested from us, including receipt of marketing communications, provided you have indicated that you want to be contacted for this purpose. 
  * Track which emails are opened and which links you click (via web beacons).



**Public Information about Your Activity on the Site:**

Some of your activity on and through the Site may be public by default. This may include, but is not limited to, content you may post publicly on the Site.

Information concerning your use of the Site (such as what pages they have visited) may be tracked anonymously through the use of Cookies and stored by us.

Please also remember that if you choose to provide Personal Data using certain network features of the Site, then that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and may be available to others. Individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in content that you create or information that you submit through the Site.

**IP Address Information:**

While we collect and store IP address information, that information is not made public. We do at times, however, share this information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business, and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy.

**Information Shared with Analytical Services:**

We use certain analytics providers (including but not limited to Google Analytics, Inspectlet, Google Optimize, Hotjar) in order to better understand how the Site is used and how it can be improved. Your IP address information may be accessed by one or more of such analytics providers. In addition, information regarding the usage activity of a certain portion of users of the Site may be shared, but such information is shared on an anonymous basis and does not reveal the identity of any individual User. These providers do not collect any personal information or store IP address locally on their websites.

**Aggregate Information:**

We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people use the Site and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their services and how the Site interface with them. In addition, these third parties may share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal Information about you that they have independently developed or acquired.

**Information Shared with Our Agents:**

We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our “ **Agents** ”). We may need to share Personal Data with our Agents in order to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal Data or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Data with our Agents.

**Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers:**

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Data as set forth in this policy.

**Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others:**

We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as it reasonably believes is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce these Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.

**Information We Share With Your Consent:**

Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and you will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.

## **Is Information About Me Secured?**

We work hard to secure your Personal Data from unauthorized access to or unauthorized processing, alteration, disclosure or destruction of Personal Data we hold by taking appropriate Technical and Organisational Security Measures, having regard to the state of the technological development and the cost of implementing any measures where appropriate, for example, pseudonymisation and encryption of Personal Data.
