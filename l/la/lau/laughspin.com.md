When you register with Laughspin.com, you create your own profile, privacy settings, and comment preferences.

**Sharing Information With Third Parties**  
We do not provide contact information to third parties without your permission. We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is reasonably necessary to offer the service, legally required or permitted by you. For example:  
• We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about Laughspin.com, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for products or services, or to provide search results or links (including sponsored links). In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. If we use third parties for the processing of any personal information, we will make reasonable efforts to implement contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to Laughspin.com specified purposes.  
• We will not sell your email address to third parties or the Laughspin.com list of email addresses to third parties.  
• We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Laughspin.com service or using the Laughspin.com name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents, or government agencies.

Using these techniques allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an ad in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where you or individuals using your computer saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked on. Laughspin.com does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on Laughspin.com unless you choose to share it with them.
