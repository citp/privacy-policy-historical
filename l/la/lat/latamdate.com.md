As such, we provide this Privacy Policy explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your personal data is collected, processed, maintained and disposed by LatamDate, a subsidiary site of Qpid Network.

* ### What Information We Collect

The types of Personal Information that we collect fall under two general categories: personally identifiable information (PII) and non-personally identifiable information (non-PII). PII consists of any information which can be used to specifically identify you as an individual, whereas non-PII consists of aggregate information or any information that does not reveal your identity. The following paragraphs explain what PII and non-PII we collect from you, and how we use such information.

* ### How We Collect and Use Information

  * _Cookies._  We use “cookies” to keep track of some types of information while you are visiting any of our Websites or using our services. Cookies are very small files placed on your computer, and they allow us to count the number of visitors to our websites and distinguish repeat visitors from new ones. They also allow us to save member preferences and track member trends. We rely on cookies for the proper operation of our Websites; therefore if your browser is set to reject all cookies, the Website(s) will not function properly and you may not enjoy all of our Services. Members who refuse cookies assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality of our Websites. We do not link the cookies to any of our members’ PII.

  * _Log Files._  Any time you visit any of our Websites, our servers automatically gather information from your browser (such as your IP addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks) to analyze trends, administer our Websites, prevent fraud, track visitor movement in the aggregate, and gather broad visitor demographic information. For example, we may log your IP address for system administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to track a user’s session. This gives us an idea of which parts of our Websites our members are visiting. We do not share the log files externally.

  * _Web Beacons._  “Web beacons” (also known as “clear gifs” and “pixel tags”) are small transparent graphic images that are often used in conjunction with cookies in order to further personalize our Websites for our users and to collect a limited set of information about our visitors.
