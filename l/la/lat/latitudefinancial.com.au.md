This information applies to the Latitude entities listed at the end of this statement. 

This statement sets out important information about credit reporting that is relevant to you if:

  * we deal with you in connection with credit applied for by, or provided to, another customer - for example, if you are a guarantor or proposed guarantor for that credit. 



We may disclose your personal information to credit reporting bodies:

We may disclose personal information about you in connection with your credit-related dealings with us to credit reporting bodies. Those credit reporting bodies may include that information in reports that they provide to other credit providers to assist them in assessing your credit worthiness.

Protecting your credit reporting information if you are the victim of fraud:

You have the right to request that a credit reporting body not use or disclose your credit reporting information if you believe that you have been, or are likely to be, the victim of fraud (for example, if you suspect that someone is using your identity details to apply for credit). You should contact each relevant credit reporting body directly if you wish to request this. 

Accessing or correcting your personal information or making a privacy complaint:

You have the right to request access to, or correction of, personal information that we hold about you, including credit-related information.

### Privacy and Credit Reporting Policy

September 2017 

The Latitude Companies1 ( **"we"/"us"/"our"** ) take our obligations to protect personal information seriously. We are bound by the Privacy Act 1988(Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles ( **"APPs"** ) (together, the **"Privacy Act"**. For Latitude Companies who are credit providers2, or who receive credit eligibility information, they are bound by PartIIIA of the Privacy Act and the 'Credit Reporting Privacy Code', which governs credit reporting in Australia.) 

#### 2\. Collection of Personal Information

##### 2.1. Kinds of Personal Information we Collect

As a group of companies offering a wide range of products and services, we collect and hold personal information about you. We collect information from our customers, prospective customers, prospective employees, contractors, suppliers, brokers, introducers, merchants, agents, service providers and the people who represent the businesses we deal with. 

The type of personal information we collect and hold may vary depending on the nature of our interactions with you. 

For example, our companies which provide credit would collect and hold financial information, credit-related information ([see section 4]()), identification information, transaction / repayment history information, banking details and employment information about you. Our insurance companies3 would collect and hold similar information including sensitive information such as health information. 

In order to satisfy our legal obligations, we may need to retain your information after a transaction or a relationship has ended. However, we will not retain your identifiable personal information longer than is reasonably necessary and permitted under Australian law. 

We will only collect sensitive information (e.g. information about your ethnicity, health or biometric information) with your consent or when permissible under Australian law. 

##### 2.2. How we Collect your Personal Information

Wherever it is possible and practical to do so, we will collect personal information directly from you, this may be in person, over the telephone, by email, over the internet, by e-mail or fax, or by completion of a form (such as an application form). 

We may also collect your personal information from a third party including a merchant or a third party with whom we have an arrangement, partnership or joint venture with. This will be limited to circumstances where it is impracticable or unreasonable for us to collect it directly from you. The type of third party who might provide information to us will vary depending on the nature of the business and interaction with you. For example, we may collect credit information and credit eligibility information from a credit reporting body or personal information from your employer to verify information in your application, hardship application or insurance claim. 

When we provide credit, third parties could include:

  * a credit reporting body; 
  * collection agents; 
  * an employer; or 
  * another financial institution. 



When we provide insurance, third parties could include: 

  * medical practitioners; 
  * your employers; or 
  * other experts assisting with a claim. 



While this is not an exhaustive list, we may obtain your personal information from other third parties which could include: 

  * an introducer such as a broker, agent, dealer and retail partner; 
  * someone authorised to act on your behalf (e.g. financial advisor, executor, administrator, trustee, guardian, attorney, accountant or consumer advocate); 
  * research agencies; 
  * a referee; 
  * recruitment consultant (e.g. for job applicants); 
  * a government body; 
  * third party service providers and / or suppliers; or 
  * one or more of our related companies, in Australia or overseas. 



#### 3\. Dealing with Personal Information

##### 3.1. How we Hold your Personal Information

We understand the importance of protecting the personal information we hold about you. We take steps to ensure your personal information is free from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised access or modification by: 

  * securing personal information both in physical and electronic form; 
  * staff education around the importance of Privacy and Data Security; 
  * limiting access to personal information only to those that need access; and 
  * protecting our systems with appropriate technology solutions. 



##### 3.2. The Purpose of Collecting, Holding, Using and Disclosing your Personal Information

We collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information in order to manage and administer the products and / or services we provide to our customers, whether they are individuals or businesses. You may be a customer, contractor, job applicant, supplier, partner or party with whom we do or have done business, or may do business with in the future. 

As a financial services provider, a major purpose for which we hold, use or disclose personal information is to assess credit applications (including assessing any proposed guarantors), manage credit (servicing and collections activity), hardship applications, insurance agreements and claims, for planning, product and service development, research purposes and to analyse the risk profiles of our customers or potential customers. 

##### 3.3. Online Servicing or Access

When you register to access products or services online, the information collected is compared with the details we may already have stored, this might include your name and date of birth. This allows us to verify who is seeking access. If this information is not provided you will not be able to access your personal information online. 

##### 3.4. Direct Marketing

Personal Information may also be used or disclosed to advise you of products and services that may be of interest to you by means of direct marketing. 

If you do not want your personal information to be used for direct marketing purposes, please contact us so that we can action this request. This is referred to as "opting out" of direct marketing. You can "opt-out" of direct marketing from each Latitude Company using the details in the 'Contact Us' table at the end of the policy. 

##### 3.5. Sharing of Personal Information

In order to provide our products and services to our customers, from time to time, we share personal information with our related bodies corporate both in Australia and overseas, as defined in the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). 

We may also share personal information to other businesses who provide services to us and other third parties including: 

  * introducers such as brokers, dealers, and retail partners; 
  * your employer; 
  * service providers such as customer service organisations, call centres, mailing houses, researchers, collections agents, data analysts; 
  * other organisations as required or authorised by law, for example, government or regulatory bodies; 
  * credit reporting bodies; 
  * other financial institutions, government bodies and credit providers; 
  * card schemes such as Mastercard or Visa; 
  * your nominated referees;

  * organisations through whom you choose to make payments to us; 
  * organisation involved in our funding arrangements such as investors, advisers, trustees and rating agencies;

  * organisations wishing to acquire an interest in any part of our business (including its receivables) for assessing or implementing any such acquisition. 



We require these businesses and our suppliers to comply with strict confidentiality requirements and the Privacy Act. 

If you are our customer (or a representative of a customer) there is additional information about how we deal with personal information in the product’s Important Privacy Notice or Product Disclosure Statement. You may request at any time your Important Privacy Notice or Product Disclosure Statement by contacting us, using the details in the 'Contact Us' table at the end of this policy. 

##### 3.6. Disclosing Information Overseas

As is the case throughout the Australian Financial Services Industry (and other major industries), technology allows for services to be provided by different service providers including some that are located overseas. We utilise overseas service providers for some of our activities and to do so may need to disclose personal information to those service providers. We may also disclose such information to other overseas recipients for the purposes listed above when permitted to do so by the Privacy Act. 

While we try to store your Personal Information locally, there may be times where our service providers are located outside of Australia. Where this happens, we always take proper steps to secure and protect your personal information, wherever its being stored. 

Further, we may share your personal information with overseas recipients in accordance with this Policy, in particular, section 3.5 above. 

Whilst it is not practicable to list every country in which such overseas recipients are likely to be located, it is likely that the countries to which your personal and credit information may be disclosed include China, countries within the European Union, India, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States of America. 

#### 4\. Credit-Related Information

As part of obtaining credit with us, we may obtain credit-related information about you from credit reporting bodies. Credit-related information in this Policy includes: 

  * credit information of the kinds listed under section 9 (see credit eligibility information) but relating primarily to your dealings with other credit providers (such as about credit applications you have made or credit that you hold with other credit providers). This information will typically have been provided by other credit providers or other third parties; and 
  * credit eligibility information (see credit eligibility information in section 9 below) about you that credit reporting bodies derive from the information above, such as credit scores, risk ratings and other evaluations about you; 



##### 4.1. Collection, Use and Disclosure of Credit-Related Information

We collect, hold, use and disclose credit information and credit eligibility information about you for purposes reasonably necessary for our business activities and consistently with the requirements in the Privacy Act as permitted by law. These purposes include but aren’t limited to: 

  * assessing credit applications and accepting guarantors; 
  * internal management purposes, including securitisation, risk management, credit scoring and portfolio analysis; 
  * to assist in the collection of overdue payments; 
  * help prevent defaults and deal with financial hardship; 
  * to participate in the credit reporting system; 
  * undertake securitisation activities and debt assignments; 
  * to deal with complaints and legal proceedings; 
  * to meet our legal and regulatory requirements (such as reporting matters to regulators or enforcement bodies when authorised or required by law); 
  * to assist other credit providers with such purposes in circumstances permitted by the Privacy Act; and 
  * organisations involved in our securitisation (funding) arrangements performing certain tasks; 
  * organisations who purchase our debt and to whom we assign our debt to; 
  * organisations wishing to acquire an interest in any part of our business (including its receivables) for assessing or implementing any such acquisition. 



Restrictions apply under the Privacy Act in relation to the circumstances and purposes for which such information may be used or disclosed and we comply with these restrictions. For example, in general, credit eligibility information may not be disclosed unless the recipient is a credit provider and restrictions apply on the use of credit eligibility information for direct marketing 

We may also disclose your credit information relating to your dealings with us to credit reporting bodies. Those credit reporting bodies may include that information in reports that they provide to other credit providers to assist them to assess your credit worthiness. 

For example, we will provide information that identifies you and about your application for credit when obtaining credit reporting information for the purposes of assessing that application. 

Should you fail to meet your payment obligations to us or commit a serious credit infringement in relation to credit provided by us, we may be entitled to disclose this information to credit reporting bodies.
