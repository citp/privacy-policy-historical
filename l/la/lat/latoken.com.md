       fraud or violation of applicable laws (including anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism
       financing regulations). This allows us to confirm your identity by comparing the information you
       provide us to public records and other third party databases. These service providers may create
       derivative data based on your Personal Data that can be used solely in connection with provision
       of identity verification and fraud or law violation prevention services.
   -   We may share your Personal Data with service providers under contract who help with parts of
       our business operations such as marketing or technology services. Our contracts require these

       us and prohibit them from selling your Personal Data to anyone else.
   -   We may share your Personal Data with financial institutions with which we partner to process
       payments which you have authorized.

       loss, to report suspected illegal activity or to investigate violations of our Terms of Use or any
       other applicable policies.
                                                                                                    Page 3


    -  We may share and transfer (including by way of cross-border transfer) Personal Data with a third
       party for the purpose of rendering the Services which will be made to our Website or systems,
       including via the use of your credit and debit card. The Personal Data will be shared with such
       third party after you elect to execute such monetary payments by using the Services of the third
       party.
    -  We may transfer any non-personal data (i.e. data that does not identify an individual person)
       provided by you through your use of the Services on our Website to a third party in order to allow
       a third party to perform preliminary examinations of non-personal data for the purpose of
       determining if you are qualified to use the services of such third party (including the history of
       your transactions on the our Website which will be provided without any identifying information

4. Disclosure of Personal Data to third parties
                                                                                                  Page 8


We will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your
permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it
or under the circumstances described below.
These are some of the ways that your information may be disclosed:
Service Providers
We occasionally hire other companies (“Data Processors”), to provide limited services on our behalf,
including Website development and operation, sending email, analyzing website use, processing
payments, providing investor information and processing data. We will only provide such providers the
information they need to deliver the service, and they are contractually prohibited from using that
information for any other reason.
To make an informed decision on whether to provide your Personal Data to us using the Website, we
need to make you aware of the organizations that act as Data Processors for us in the provision of our
Services to you. We will let you know of such Data Processors in due course, you can also direct your
inquiries as to current Data Processors to privacy@latoken.com.
Data in Aggregate Format
We may disclose depersonalized aggregated data and user statistics to prospective partners and other
third parties. Depersonalized data is data that does not identify an individual person.
Other
We also may disclose your information in special cases, for example, when we believe that we must
disclose information to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our
Terms of Use, or may be causing damage to or interference with our rights or property, other Website
users or customers, or anyone else who may be harmed by such activities. We may disclose or access
account information when we believe in good faith that applicable laws require it and for administrative
and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service and improve our products and services.
   5. How can you control your Personal Data?
We offer our users choices for the collection, use and sharing of Personal Data. You may contact us at
privacy@latoken.com if you wish to edit your private information and we will use commercially
reasonable efforts to accommodate your request. If you believe that any inaccurate or inappropriate
information has been obtained or provided to others through your use of the Website, please contact a
representative of LATOKEN at privacy@latoken.com.
   6. Storage of your Personal Data
We will try to limit the storage of your Personal Data to the extent that storage is necessary to serve the
purposes for which the Personal Data was processed, to resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and
as required or permitted by law.
   7. Security precautions to protect your Personal Data
Remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished your
work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account by using your computer when you are
away from it. Because information sent through the Internet travels from computer to computer
throughout the world, when you give us information, that information may be sent electronically to
servers outside of the country where you originally entered the information.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Information
that you disclose by use of the Website, by posting a message or using e-mail, potentially could be
collected and used or misused by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties or
use of such information by third parties for their own purposes, legal or illegal. As a result, while we
strive to protect your Personal Data, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you
transmit to us or from our Services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission,
                                                                                                    Page 9


 we use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems.
    8. Getting informed about Personal Data breach
    8.1 When do we need to tell you about personal breach?
 In the case of a Personal Data breach, we shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than
 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify you of such breach. If a breach is likely to result in a high
 risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, we must inform you directly and without undue delay.
    8.2 What is a Personal Data breach?
 A Personal Data breach means a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,
 alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Personal Data. This includes breaches that are the
 result of both accidental and deliberate causes. It also means that a breach is more than just losing
 Personal Data.
 Personal Data breaches can include:
      -   access by an unauthorized third party;
      -   deliberate or accidental action (or inaction) by a data controller or data processor;
      -   sending Personal Data to an incorrect recipient;
      -   computing devices containing Personal Data being lost or stolen;
      -   alteration of Personal Data without permission;
      -   loss of availability of Personal Data.
