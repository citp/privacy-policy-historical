Using Personal Data helps us understand how our readers use our websites. Our legal basis for processing Personal Data here is our legitimate interest in making improvements to our current products and developing new products;
  * **to bill our customers:** we, along with our authorised payments processors, securely process your payment information to take payments, give refunds and to detect and prevent fraudulent activity.

## 6\. HOW WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA SECURE

We have security measures in place to restrict access to Personal Data, to guard against unauthorised or unlawful processing of Personal Data and against damage to, accidental loss or destruction of, your Personal Data.

The security measures applied include storing your Personal Data on secure servers, encrypting transfers of Personal Data to or from our servers, and only granting access to your Personal Data where necessary.

## 7\. HOW LONG DO WE RETAIN YOUR PERSONAL DATA

We only keep your Personal Data for as long as necessary in relation to the purpose for which we are processing that information. To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

We keep your Personal Data in accordance with our data retention policy. Where your personal information is no longer required we will ensure it is securely deleted.

We will not release, rent or sell your Personal Data to third parties for their own use, other than as part of a sale of the whole or a substantial part of the assets of LBR. We will take reasonable steps, such as the inclusion of contractual clauses in our contracts with such third parties, to ensure that any third parties who do receive and handle such Personal Data are bound by the same obligations as us and do not use such Personal Data for any other purpose.

We may disclose your Personal Data to third parties if we buy or sell any business assets, in which case we may disclose your Personal Data to a prospective buyer or seller of such assets.

We may also disclose your Personal Data if we are required by law to do so, for example, to the Police.

The Personal Data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and processed by, a processor based in a destination outside of the European Economic Area (" **EEA** "). If this happens we will take steps, such as the inclusion of contractual clauses into our contracts with such processors, to ensure that your Personal Data is safe and treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy & Cookie Policy.

You can contact us at any time via the contact details in section 2 above for details of specific disclosures made in respect of your Personal Data.
