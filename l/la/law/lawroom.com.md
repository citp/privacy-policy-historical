LawRoom Privacy Policy
Data Collected by LawRoom
Company Profile
To create individualized profiles for client companies, LawRoom collects
pertinent information, including location, number of employees, and industry.
We use this information for the sole purpose of providing clients with accurate,
custom-tailored content.
Personal Data
Client companies contract with LawRoom to provide their users with interactive,
online training and access to employment law compliance resources. We
collect personal data to identify our users and to track their site usage. We
collect the following personally identifiable information from our users:
    •  Name
    •  Title
    •  Email address
    •  Company
We use this data to verify users' identity, provide customized content, send
announcements and reminders, monitor user progress in our courses, and
provide reports to users' companies.
We do not share personal data with any third parties, other than a user's
company, except that we may at times have to disclose personal data to
comply with a court order or other legal process.
Review or Edit Your Personal Data
You may request to review or change your personal data by sending us an
email at admin@lawroom.com.
Other Data
LawRoom collects certain information provided by users, such as survey
comments, in-course questions about course material or technical issues, and
questions about employment law topics, to improve and support our services.
This data is not anonymous (it is stored with personally identifiable information) so
©2006-2014 LawRoom                  Walnut Creek, CA                       800-652-9546 1


that we can respond to users' questions and concerns, and include course
feedback in reports to client companies.
We do not share this data with any third parties, other than a user's company,
except in the following circumstances:
Ask Ed: Ask Eds are employment-related questions submitted to LawRoom
through our website. We may share users' Ask Eds, along with our answers, on
our site and in communications to clients and users. We share these questions
and answers to benefit all clients by clarifying employment law issues and
directing clients to relevant employment law resources. However, we present
Ask Eds anonymously, without names or other personally identifiable information.
Comments and Testimonials: LawRoom may share user feedback and course
comments as testimonials on our site and in our marketing materials. We do not
identify the user who provided the feedback.
In addition, we collect the following technical data anonymously:
    •   Internet Protocol (IP) Address
    •   Browser types
    •   Device information
We log IP addresses for systems administration purposes, such as tracking a user's
session and to determine how often the areas of our site are visited. We
periodically view and discard the information. We do not link IP addresses to
specific users.
We also use third party services, such as Google Analytics, to collect anonymous
data about how our site is used.
Cookies
A cookie is a small file created by your Web browser to assign a unique
identification to your computer. Cookies allow LawRoom to recognize users'
computers so that users only have to log in once per session. We do not use
cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer. To use
LawRoom, you must have the cookies option of your browser turned on.
We do not allow third parties (such as advertisers) to use cookies on our sites.
Clear GIFs
Clear GIFs (also known as Web Beacons or Web Bugs) are small, transparent files
embedded in Web pages that track when users access or interact with Web
content. LawRoom embeds Clear GIFs in email announcements and
©2006-2014 LawRoom                 Walnut Creek, CA                     800-652-9546 2


broadcasts. We use the clear GIFs to track when users open LawRoom emails,
and how many emails are opened in total. This creates a log of the IP addresses
of the users who have opened the emails, but we do not link the IP addresses to
specific people or personally identifiable information.
Do Not Track Notice
LawRoom does not track its users across third party websites, nor does it allow
third parties to collect personally identifiable information on LawRoom pages. As
such, our service does not respond to browser "Do Not Track" requests.
Third Party Sites
LawRoom includes links to third party sites unaffiliated with our courses and
resources. LawRoom is not responsible for the content on these sites. Please
check the privacy statements on these sites for information on their policies.
Third parties may not collect personally identifiable information when a user
accesses LawRoom's website.
Children's Privacy
LawRoom respects the privacy of children. Our website and courses are not for
use by children under the age of 15, and children under the age of 13 are not
permitted to use this website or our training courses.

Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the
collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member
countries and Switzerland. LawRoom has certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor
