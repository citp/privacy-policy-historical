Confidentiality and discretion are the cornerstones of every job search.

In order to register as a LawCrossing member, users are required to provide pertinent contact information such as their name, an email address, and a mailing address. To complete the sign-up process and subscribe to the service, users are also required to provide financial information, in the form of a valid credit card number and billing address. After subscribing, members may also provide personally identifiable information for other purposes in their use of the site. This includes, but is not limited to, submitting a resume or cover letter. However, any submitted resume or cover letter is viewable only by the person who uploaded or pasted it into the account. Any transmission of these materials can only be achieved through the initiative of the user. LawCrossing does not collect personal information from its subscribers unless they voluntarily and knowingly provide it to us. This means that a user can visit our site without telling us who they are and without revealing any personally identifiable information.
