# Privacy policy - Information

We are Globe Business Publishing Limited. We’re a UK company, registered number 03205159, and our registered office is 87 Lancaster Road, London, England, W11 1QQ.

We operate the LawCareers.Net (LCN) website and subscription service. This statement explains what we do with your personal information when you register to use that website, subscribe to use our service, and how to exercise your rights over it.

If you have any questions about our use of your personal information, or if you want to exercise your rights, you can contact our data privacy team. The best way to do this is by email to [dataprotectionteam@globebmg.com](mailto:dataprotectionteam@globebmg.com), but if you prefer you can also write to us at: Data Protection Team, Globe Business Media Group, New Hibernia House, Winchester Walk, London SE1 9AG.

### Who is in charge of your information

In respect of the personal information you give us when you subscribe to LCN or register to use the LCN website, we are the “data controller” responsible for that information.

### The information we collect about you, how we will collect it, why we collect it and what we will do with it

We will collect the information that you give us on the subscription form when you subscribe to LCN, on the registration page when you register to be an LCN website user, when you register to attend an LCN Live event, on the webform when you complete LCN surveys or in any correspondence with us, including your name and address, and we will use that information to give you access to the LCN subscription service or LCN website content, and to communicate with you about your use of LCN, for example to let you know about any updates or changes to LCN. If you are a business, we may also use this information to send you marketing communications about products or services provided by us or our group companies, and/or other third-party legal information, products and events. If you are a consumer then we will only send you the aforementioned marketing communications if you have ticked the appropriate opt-in boxes on the website registration form.

We also gather certain statistical information about how you access and use our website, such as your browser version, the publications you download, and the pages you access during a session, in order to help us build a general picture about how people use our website, and to identify technical or usability problems with it. We do this in order to help us make our website better. We do not retain this statistical information in a way which identifies you personally, except when you register or subscribe on the website.

### Who we will share your personal information with

If you have registered on the LCN or LCN Live website or purchased a service or product, we may share your personal information with our group companies so that they can contact you in relation to the products and services that they offer. We may, for that reason, transfer your data outside the European Economic Area to our group companies located outside of it. Those group companies are subject to our group-wide data protection processes which have been devised to comply with European standards.

We will share aggregate data with potential authors, contributors, subscribers, clients, advertisers and advertising networks that require this to select and serve relevant adverts to you and others. Save as expressly stated, we do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users. We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target. We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.

We hold events including seminars and conferences which are sponsored by third parties or have third party speakers. Where you register for one of these events we may share your details with those third parties.

Other than that, we will not share your data with any third parties and we will not transfer your data outside the European Economic Area.

### The legal basis on which we deal with your personal information

Under the new data protection law starting in May 2018 we have a number of lawful reasons that we can use (or 'process') your personal information. One of the lawful reasons is called 'legitimate interests'.

Broadly speaking Legitimate Interests means that we can process your personal information if:

  * We have a genuine and legitimate reason and we are not harming any of your rights and interests.



So, what does this mean? When you provide your personal details to us we use your information for our legitimate business interests to send you marketing communications or to gather information about how you use our website. Before doing this, though, we will also carefully consider and balance any potential impact on you and your rights. If you are a consumer rather than a business then when we send you marketing communications, we do so on the basis of your consent provided that you have ticked the appropriate boxes on the LCN or LCN Live registration form.

Some other typical examples of when we might use the approach are for preventing fraud, maintaining the security of our system, data analytics, enhancing, modifying or improving our services, identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of our campaigns.

When we use your personal information in order to create or maintain your LCN subscription, your registration to the LCN website or your delegate application and/or registration on the LCN Live website, we do this on the basis that it is necessary for us to do so in order to perform the contract we are entering into with you to provide you with your LCN subscription, LCN website registration or LCN Live delegate place.

### Your rights and how to exercise them

The law gives you certain rights in respect of the information that we hold about you. Below is a short overview of the most commonly-used rights. It is not a complete, exhaustive statement of your rights in respect of your personal data. The website of the Information Commissioner’s Office ([http://www.ico.org.uk](http://www.ico.org.uk/)) has a wealth of useful information in respect of your rights over your personal data.

If you wish to exercise your rights, the best way to do so is by email to the office of our data protection officer at [dataprotectionteam@globebmg.com](mailto:dataprotectionteam@globebmg.com), but if you prefer you can also write to us at the address above.

### Your right to unsubscribe

When you receive marketing communications from us you have the right to unsubscribe at any time. You can do that by following the unsubscribe link in the email or by contacting us at: [dataprotectionteam@globebmg.com](mailto:dataprotectionteam@globebmg.com). If you unsubscribe, we will stop sending you marketing communications.

### Your right to a copy of the information we hold about you

With some exceptions designed to protect the rights of others, you have the right to a copy of the personal data that we hold about you, as well as information about what we do with it, who we share it with and how long we will hold it for. We may make a reasonable charge for additional copies of that data beyond the first copy, based on our administrative costs.

### Your right to have inaccurate information about you corrected

You have the right to have the information we hold about you corrected if it is factually inaccurate. In most cases the easiest way to do that is to contact us and let us know what information needs to be changed.

### Your right to have your information deleted in some circumstances

In some circumstances, you have the right to require us to delete the information that we hold about you. In particular, if you cease being an LCN subscriber and we no longer need to process your personal data, then we will delete the relevant data from our systems.

### Your right to complain to the ICO

You also have the right to lodge a complaint about our handling of your personal information with the Information Commissioner’s Office. You can contact them on 0303 123 1113.
