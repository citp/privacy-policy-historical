 **Our Commitment To Privacy**

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our home page and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

This notice applies to all information collected from or submitted to the Martindale-Hubbell ("Martindale") Web sites located at [www.lawyers.com](http://www.lawyers.com/), [www.martindale.com](http://www.martindale.com/), collectively referred to here as "our Web site." Other Martindale Web sites may operate under their own privacy notices. Our Web site contains links to other Web sites operated by third parties. Martindale is not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of such third-party Web sites.

 **The Information We Collect**

Our Web site is not set up to automatically collect personally-identifiable information from visitors to our Web site. It does recognize the home server of visitors, but not e-mail addresses. For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider our visitors use, but not the names, addresses or other information about our visitors that would allow us to identify the particular visitors to our Web site. The server information is used only for internal purposes by our technical support staff.

Our Web site does track certain non-personally-identifiable information about the visits to our Web site. For example, we compile aggregate statistics that show the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Web site and its individual pages. These aggregated statistics are used internally to improve our Web site and for product development and marketing purposes generally. The aggregated non-personal statistics may also be provided to advertisers and other third parties for certain purposes, but again, the statistics contain no personally-identifiable information and cannot be used to gather such information.

In a few areas on our Web site, we may ask you to provide personally-identifiable information that will enable us to verify whether you are entitled to access and use certain information, materials and services available from our Web site; to enable us to enhance your site visit; to assist you with customer service or technical support issues; to follow up with you after your visit; or to otherwise support your customer relationship with Martindale. Your provision of this information and participation in the areas that require it is completely optional. You may decide not to provide the information and not to visit or access the areas that require it.

For example, we may request such information from you when you:

1\. Log-on to certain areas of our Web site that require your user name and password as a condition to gaining access to the information, materials or services in that area.

2\. Register or sign-up to subscribe to a service.

3\. Subscribe to a newsletter or ask to be added to our mailing lists for other products or services.

4\. Place an order for a product or service.

5\. Participate in a sweepstakes or other promotional offer.

6\. Provide feedback in an online survey.

In each of the instances above, we typically ask for some or all of the following information: your name, e-mail address, phone number, mailing address, the type of business you are in, product preference information, any applicable identification number or password that we may require, as well as other similar information that is needed to register or subscribe you to services or offers. On occasion, we may ask for additional information to enable us to provide you with access to and use of certain other information, materials and services. In the case of mailed materials, you will be able to "unsubscribe" to these mailings at any time.

 **How We Use Information**

 **Martindale uses your personal information only for specific purposes.** The personal information you provide to us when using our Web site -- such as your name, postal or e-mail address or telephone number -- will be kept confidential and used to support your customer relationship with Martindale. It also may be used to notify you of special offers, updated information and new products and services from Martindale, or offers from third parties that we think may be of interest to you. Agents or contractors of Martindale who are given access to your personal information will be required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for Martindale.

Martindale may merge your information collected at our Web site with similar data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to you.

The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by DoubleClick, our Web advertising partner. Information about your visit to this site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you on this site. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique ‘cookie’ on your browser. For more information about DoubleClick, cookies, and how to ‘opt-out’ of this service, please [click here](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/corporate/privacy/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&).

Other unique circumstances may arise where we are required to disclose your personal information to third parties, such as in connection with a corporate divestiture or dissolution where all or a portion of our business or assets (including our associated customer lists containing your personal information) are sold, or if disclosure is required by law or is pertinent to judicial or governmental investigations or proceedings.

 **You can opt-out of receiving further marketing materials from Martindale at any time.** We may send you information about our various products and services, or other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. Only Martindale (or agents or contractors working on behalf of Martindale and under confidentiality agreements) are authorized to send you these direct mailings. If you do not want to receive such mailings, you can tell us when you give us your personal information. Or, at any time, you can opt-out of receiving further marketing materials from Martindale by [clicking here](mailto:opt_out@martindale.com?subject=Opt%20Out).

 **Public Forums**

Our Web site may make chat rooms, forums, message boards and other interactive features available to you. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas is not protected as confidential and becomes public information. You are solely responsible and should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information in these areas.

 **Our Commitment To Data Security**

To prevent unauthorized access to your personal information, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

 **How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information** You can request a copy of the personally-identifiable information that Martindale has collected about you via the Internet by contacting our Information Privacy Manager at the address below. You can also have factual inaccuracies in this information corrected by contacting this same person.
