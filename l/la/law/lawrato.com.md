This policy describes how information about you may be used, how it may be disclosed and how you may access this information.

This page will serve as a policy of our privacy practices and a summary of your privacy rights.

We created this Site Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to give you confidence as you visit and use the Site, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy.

This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Site, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Site or any website of LawRato.com’s partners, each of which may have data collection, storage, and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy. Your use of the Site is governed by this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. If you are registering an account or using the Site on behalf of an individual or entity other than yourself, you represent that you are authorized by such individual or entity to accept this Privacy Policy on such individual's or entity's behalf.

Please note our primary concern is to provide a platform for quick and simple online / telephonic / face-to-face consultation.

Be advised, in case your question or consultation contains matters of high security risk or there is a high privacy concern (like matters of Constitution, matters related to judiciary, matters related to police or law enforcement) we suggest you to use alternate services.

It is advisable to include only relevant de-identifiable Personal Information in case history and files uploaded by you

If you do not agree to terms of our Privacy Policy we kindly request you to not use this site.

### **2\. Information that may be collected**

In order to use LawRato.com, you are asked to enter an e-mail address and password, which we refer to as your LawRato.com ID. This process will allow you to manage your profile and/or account; upload files (case history and other relevant documents) and ask specific queries.

When asking questions, you will be asked to submit personal information like age, gender and case history (optional but recommended). Providing us with other personal and identifiable information is, of course, optional and not recommended.

However, in some cases it may not be possible for us to provide the service in question without receiving specific information from you and in some cases you would be requested by the consulting Professional Expert to provide additional information in order to answer your questions. Additional information could be details of your case history, specific reports etc.

We automatically track and collect IP addresses, domain servers, type of web browsers, computers and domain servers used to access the site, referring source to the site and your interaction with the site and the browser, (Collectively “Traffic data”).
