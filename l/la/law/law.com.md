ALM is a business-to-business integrated global digital media company headquartered in the United States. We provide a range of products and services that deliver premium content to professionals in the legal, financial services, benefits, consulting, property and casualty insurance and real estate industries, including publications and resources through ALM’s 30+ brands, intelligence solutions, events, and marketing solutions.

We’re dedicated to providing our customers with market-leading critical news, data, analysis, marketing solutions, and events that empower them to grow, compete, and win. We take well-earned pride in our mission to connect professionals with the information and people they need to solve the business challenges they face every day.

 **2\. INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

The personal information that we may collect from and about you broadly falls into the following categories.

 **2.1 Information we collect directly.** You may provide personal information to us through the Services – for example, when you sign up for, order, subscribe to, or make use of any of our Services, consult with our customer service team, or communicate with us in any way.

We may also collect personal information, such as your contact and professional details, when you attend our events, take part in surveys, or through other business or marketing interactions we may have with you. You may choose to provide additional information when you communicate with us or otherwise interact with us.

In most cases your provision of personal information to us is entirely voluntary. However, if you fail to provide such information, we may not be able to provide certain Services or information to you.

The personal information you provide may include:

  *  **Contact Information** : When setting up an ALM account to access or subscribe to the Services, you will be asked to provide certain information, including contact information (such as name, address, email, or telephone number), and professional information (such as job title, department, or job role).
  *  **Financial Information** : If you are paying for any of the Services (for example, through one of our online check-out pages), we may require you to provide credit card or other financial information in order to process a payment from you. You should never provide detailed credit card information directly to ALM via an unsecure form (such as email).
  *  **Transaction Information** : We will maintain a record of your purchases, transactional information, your Services history, and usage. We may also retain your communications with us and our responses.
  *  **Partner Products & Services Offered on the Services**: Third parties, such as our partners, sponsors, or advertisers whose services are promoted or advertised on the Services, may request that you provide personal information. Please see How We Share Information in Section 4 below for further details.
  *  **Research Surveys** : You may elect to provide information in connection with research surveys in which you participate.
  *  **Emails to ALM** : If you send us emails, you should be aware that any information provided in an email may not be secure or encrypted and therefore may be available to others. Please exercise caution if you decide to disclose any personal or confidential information to us in any email.
  *  **Job Applicants to ALM** : When applying for select job postings at ALM, we will ask you to send us your resume or other relevant information online.
  *  **Lawjobs.com and LegalWeekjobs.com** : When using the Lawjobs.com and Legalweekjobs.com Services, you may elect to send us your resume or other relevant information.



 **2.2 Information we collect automatically**. When you use the Services, we (or our third party partners) may collect information about your device and usage of the Services. In some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area, this information may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws.

We may use a variety of technologies (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”) to collect some of this information. Our use of Tracking Technologies is discussed in more detail in Tracking Technologies and Advertising and Analytics Services in  Section 5 below.

We may use Tracking Technologies to automatically collect the information described below:

  *  **Device Information** : We may collect certain information about the device you use to access the Services, including but not limited to IP addresses for your devices, unique device identifiers, browser types, and browser language.
  *  **User History** : We may log certain usage information about your use of the Services, which may include a history of the pages you view. If you download and use any ALM software or application on your device, the log files will automatically be collected by the application and sent to our servers when your device syncs up for the latest content available.
  *  **Mobile/Location Information** : We may collect additional information from you if you access the Services through a mobile device, for example we may collect your unique device identifier, your device’s operating system, mobile carrier, or your location when you opt in for us to do so. However the degree to which your location can be identified depends on the device you are using ( _e.g._ laptop, smartphone, tablet) and how you are connected to the internet ( _e.g._ via cable broadband connection, Wi-Fi, etc.). If you enable location services for the Services we may collect your regional location data periodically as you use or leave open the Services. We may also collect your location information from your IP address or zip code.



We may also use location data internally or in conjunction with our third party service providers to customize your experience and provide offers that may be relevant to you. Depending on the device you use to access the Services ( _e.g._ Apple™ iOS, Google™ Android, Windows, etc.) you may be able to control whether location data is collected from the settings on your wireless device.

 **2.3 Information we collect from third party sources.**

  *  **Third Party Sources** : From time to time we may obtain personal information about you from third party sources, such as public databases, social networking services, third party data providers and our joint marketing partners. Examples of the information we may receive from third party sources include job title, company, location, updated contact information, and other demographic and professional information. We use this information, alone or in combination with other information (including personal information we collect), to enhance our ability to provide relevant marketing and content to you and to develop and provide you with more relevant products, features, and services.
  *  **Social Networking Accounts** : When you choose to log into your ALM account through your LexisNexis account or social networking accounts, link your social networking accounts with the Services, or engage with the Services through the LexisNexis platform or third party social media platforms, you may be allowing us ongoing access to certain information stored on those platforms. In addition, as you interact with the Services, you may also be providing information about your activities to LexisNexis or the third party social networking platforms, as applicable. You should make sure that you are comfortable with the information such services may make available to us by visiting the applicable platforms’ privacy policies and/or modifying your privacy settings directly with those platforms.

  *  **Advertising Partners** : We may partner with third party advertising networks and exchanges to display advertising on our websites or to manage and serve our advertising on other sites and may share your personal information with them for this purpose. Please see more information in Your Choices/How to Opt Out in Section 6 below.
  *  **Organizational Changes** : Should ALM undergo a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization, or liquidation, ALM’s accumulated customer information will be treated as an asset and, like other business assets, subject to transfer to or acquisition by a third party.

 **5\. TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES AND ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS SERVICES**

  *  **Targeted Advertising** : We and our third party partners and vendors may use Tracking Technologies, such as cookies, pixels, and web beacons and collect and store information about you when you use or interact with our Services, marketing communications, advertising content and/or third party websites, in order to provide you with targeted advertising based on your browsing activities and interests. These third parties automatically receive your IP address or mobile device identifier when you access the Services or third party websites. They may also use Tracking Technologies to measure the effectiveness of advertisements, to personalize the advertising content, and to serve you advertisements that are relevant to your regional location.

  *  **Cross Device Tracking** : We (and our third party service providers) also use Tracking Technologies that recognize and collect usage information and information about the devices you use to connect with our Services and third party websites.

They automatically receive your IP address or mobile device identifier when you connect to the Services or third party websites. This data may be combined with the same information from another browser or device if you use multiple browsers or devices. You may opt-out of this type of tracking/information collection by clicking [_here_](https://www.aboutads.info/) _._ This opt-out applies to the specific device/browser combination on which you are browsing, so you will need to opt-out on each device and browser separately.

To help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate technical, organizational, physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to protect the information we collect. Specific measures we use include installing anti-intrusion hardware and firewalls, conducting penetration testing and virus scans, monitoring Operating System and software logs and applying software patches. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.

Please understand, however, that while we try our best to safeguard your personally identifiable information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any social media or other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

To help protect the privacy of your own information, including maintaining the confidentiality of any account information or access credentials, we recommend you take precautions to protect the security of any personal information that you transmit over any public or untrusted network by using encryption and other techniques to prevent unauthorized persons from intercepting or receiving any of your personally identifiable information.

Our Services are directed at a general audience and not directed to those under the age of 18. ALM asks that minors not submit any personal information.

 **12\. HOW LONG DO WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION?**

We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so. For example, we retain information in order to provide you with services, to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements, and to enforce our agreements, prevent fraud, assist with investigations, resolve disputes, analyze or troubleshoot programs, enforce our terms of use, or take other actions permitted by law. We may also retain information to prevent re-registration in the event that your account has been suspended or terminated or to create an archival copy of your information, which might be used by us for record keeping and internal purposes.

 **13.2 Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information**

    * If you are a resident of the EEA, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
    * However, we will normally collect personal information from you where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. Typically, our legitimate interests include: improving, maintaining, providing, and enhancing our technology, products, content, and services; ensuring the security of the Services; and conducting marketing activities.

Our standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request by contacting us at [_ALMLegal@alm.com_](mailto:ALMLegal@alm.com).
