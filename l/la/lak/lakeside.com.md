# Privacy Policy | Lakeside Collection

The Lakeside Collection® holds the privacy and security of our customers in the highest regard. The following data explains what kind of information is gathered on The Lakeside Collection® website and how the information is used.

The Lakeside Collection® will NOT rent, sell or trade the contents of our emailing list to any outside parties. You can be assured that your email address will be kept in strictest confidence.

  * Does The Lakeside Collection® offer secure online ordering?

Yes, we do. All customer and order information is securely stored behind a firewall and protected from unauthorized access. Your online session is encrypted using SSL with a certificate provided by Verisign. Therefore, none of your personal information, including credit card number, name and address, can be read as the information travels over the internet. Your credit card number is protected by our encryption methods as soon as we capture it and before it is stored in our database to protect it from potential theft. The Lakeside Collection® does not store your CVV2 credit card security code anywhere on its system.

  * What kind of information do you collect from me when I visit your web site?

We do not collect any information from those merely visiting our site. We do ask for additional information if you would like to place an order, request an order status or a free catalog, or if you need to communicate with us regarding an account issue.

  * Does The Lakeside Collection® share information it collects from me with outside parties?

The information you provided on the web site is used to fulfill a product order, a catalog request or research a customer inquiry. The information that you provide is stored in house separate from the Internet.  
We do occasionally share name and address information with other catalog companies that offer similar products. We will not share any personal financial information. If you are on our catalog mailing list, or order from one of our catalogs, and would prefer not to have your name shared with other catalog companies, please email at marketingdepartment @ lakeside.com and ask that your name not be shared.  
From time to time, we may modify or amend this privacy and security policy in order to comply with new laws or regulations or to reflect future changes in our business practices. All such modifications and amendments to the privacy and security policy shall be posted here in the Customer Service section of www.lakeside.com. The current policy has been in effect since January 2007.

  * What are 'cookies' and how do you use them?

'Cookies' are small bits of information that are sent from the Web server and kept on your browser. They are used by the Web server so it can remember who you are as you browse from page to page of our website.  
The cookie we send to your browser is not written to any file on your computer. It is only kept in memory and goes away when you exit your browser program. The content is simply a single number that helps us remember your order information.

  * What do you do with my email address?

The Lakeside Collection® collects your email address as part of your registration with us. We use this address to communicate with you about your account. We do not sell or otherwise give out your email address to others.

  * How else do you use information about me?

Once you make a purchase from us, you become a part of our customer file. As a valued Lakeside Collection® customer, you will be put on our mailing list to receive catalogs from us in the future.

  * How do I remove my name from The Lakeside Collection® mailing list?

If, at any time, you wish to be removed from our mailing list please contact us by email with your name and address or click on the '[Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/contactus.asp)' option.
