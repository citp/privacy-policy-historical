What Members Can Do to Help

Lake Trust Credit Union is committed to protecting the privacy of its members. Members can help by following these simple guidelines:

  * Protect your account numbers, plastic card numbers, PINs (personal identification numbers), or passwords. Never keep your PIN with your card, which can provide free access to your accounts if your card is lost or stolen.
  * Use caution when disclosing your account numbers, social security numbers, etc. to other persons. If someone calls you explaining the call is on behalf of the Credit Union and asks for your account number, you should beware. Official Credit Union staff will have access to your information and will not need to ask for it.
  * Keep your information with us current. If your address or phone number changes, please let us know. It is important that we have current information on how to reach you. If we detect potentially fraudulent or unauthorized activity or use of an account, we will attempt to contact you immediately.
  * Let us know if you have questions. Please do not hesitate to call us - we are here to serve you!

  * The date and time you access our site;
  * The pages you visit and the result of the request, such as an image or query;
