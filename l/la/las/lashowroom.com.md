## Information Collection and Use

### Information Collection

The ownership of user information collected in is twofold. Primarily, LAShowroom.com owns all the information collected on the site. However, as and when a user requests access to a particular store, then that store also owns that user's information. LAShowroom.com collects information from our users at several different points on our website. 

### Registration

In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to provide contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact the user throughout the duration of the business transaction and to inform them about new products and services on our site for which he/she has expressed interest. It is also required for the user to provide unique identifiers (such as, username and password) in order to facilitate the security concerns of the individual showroom owners. 

### Order

We request information from the user on our checkout form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as method of payment, credit card number, expiration date). This information is used solely for billing purposes and to fill customers' orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user. 

### Information Use

LAShowroom.com is an online marketplace of apparel manufacturers and wholesalers. The information collected at the time of registration and checkout are used to carry out the primary task of facilitating a sale from the apparel manufacturer/wholesaler to the customer.

As soon as a user registers with a store or requests access to a store, his/her registration information is sent to that particular store. The store representative then can either immediately grant access to the user or contact the user for further questions/clarifications before granting access. The user can view and purchase clothing from those stores where he/she has been granted access. However, the right to cancel or grant access to any users is at the sole discretion of the store representative. Once granted access, the user will be able to access the store using his/her username and password (login information). It is the responsibility of the user and of the store representative to maintain the secrecy of the username and password. Any fraudulent use of login information will lead to legal action or at the very least cancellation of access. 

The website also keeps track of user statistics such as: date of registration, date of last visit, the number of times visited, etc. This information is used for aggregate analysis and to make business decisions. Again, the individual stores have access to this user information only if those users have requested access from them.

The user's contact information is used for the following purposes:

  1. User identity verification
  2. Communicate new products and services
  3. Communication website information (Maintenance shutdowns, new store launches, store removals, etc.)
  4. Communication during/throughout the business transaction



The information collected at the time of checkout is used for the following purposes:

  1. Track order status during/throughout the business transaction
  2. Maintain order history
  3. Facilitate billing and shipping



LAShowroom.com reserves the right to share the registration information with any third party that we deem is a business associate. This will only be done as a business enhancement exercise. 

### Profile

We store information that we collect through the registration page, cookies, etc. to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users which details their viewing preferences/habits. Consequently, collected information is tied to the users' personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We sometimes share your profile with other third parties, as deemed applicable for pertinent business decisions. 

### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies only. This cookie will help the system in recognizing that a particular user is logged in and allow him/her to access all the stores that he/she has access to. Session ID cookies are designed in such a way that once a user closes the browser, the cookie simply terminates. 

### Log Files

Like most standard websites our servers use log files. These logs include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses and other collected data are not linked to personally identifiable information.

## Communications from the Site

### Special Offers and Updates

We send all new members a welcoming email to verify their password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications in the emails themselves. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections. 

### Service Announcements and Customer Service

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, although they can deactivate their account to refrain from receiving further emails. These communications are not promotional in nature, and are provided as a service to inform users of periods of possible interrupted service. 

## Sharing

### Legal Disclaimer

Although we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website. 

### Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)

We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information. 

### Third Party Intermediaries

We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

### Business Transitions

In the event LAShowroom.com goes through a business transition such as a merger, an acquisition, or the selling of a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via email prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, they will be given a choice consistent with our notification of changes section. 

## Links

This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, LAShowroom.com, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when leaving our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.

## Security

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, their information is protected both online and offline. 

We do everything in our power to protect our users' information. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted within our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job function (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desks to prevent unauthorized access. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to their workstation, and in turn user information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they must do to ensure our users' information is protected. 

If users have any questions about the security at our website, users can send an email to [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

## Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone number, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can be done at the [My Account](https://web.archive.org/account) page available at the top of each store within LAShowroom.com. The changes made in [My Account](https://web.archive.org/account) section of any store will reflect in all the store accounts of the user. 

## Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
