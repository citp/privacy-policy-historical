# Lasso Development Privacy Statement

**Lasso Development On Privacy**  
Lasso Development knows you don't want the information you provide us shared indiscriminately. Here, we explain how we collect information, what we do with it, and what controls you have.

**E-mail Addresses & Mailings**  
Lasso Development maintains two E-mail databases: the names of developers to whom we send the Lasso Development positions to, and the names of all account holders to pass important updates information to. We do not collect E-mail addresses from standard E-mail correspondence we receive. Lasso Development does not sell, trade, or otherwise share these E-mail addresses with outside organizations unless account holders have requested to receive information themselves through their control panel. 

**Postal Addresses**  
Full postal addresses provided by companies or recruitment agencies when they register with Lasso Development are only shown to visitors and developers with any Lasso Development positions they have available.

**Demographic Information**  
Lasso Development's registration form asks visitors to provide optional demographic information about their companies. We use this information in the aggregate for internal analysis and to let advertisers know what kind of businesses use our Web site. Lasso Development may in the future use this information to better target its mailings about Lasso Development Services.

**Passwords**  
Certain areas of Lasso Development require a password for admittance. Access to the database of password names is limited to the user of the password and Lasso Development Administration.

**Cookies**  
Lasso Development **DOES NOT** use cookies, apart from the visitor stating that they wish their Username and Password to be remembered by their own browser.

**IP Addresses**  
Lasso Development logs the IP addresses of its visitors for internal analysis.

**. . . And a Few Final Things**  


In several clearly-marked places, Lasso Development has partnered with outside companies to provide visitors with direct access to these companies' services. Information you give these companies may be used by them in ways that are different from Lasso Development's policies; please review these companies' privacy practices if you are concerned.

Marketers sometimes collect and use E-mail addresses that are posted by companies at public forums such as the Lasso Development positions board. We can not control this.

Marketers who are unaffiliated with Lasso Development sometimes send out E-mails that falsely claim to have a Lasso Development.com return E-mail address. Please use [abuse@lassodevelopment.com](mailto:abuse@lassodevelopment.com) to inform Lasso Development about any misuse of our E-mail address.

Lasso Development works hard to maintain the trust we've built with our loyal customers and users. Please E-mail any questions, concerns, or comments you have about these policies to [feedback@lassodevelopment.com](mailto:feedback@lassodevelopment.com).

The Lasso Development Web site and databases are maintained by the staff of Lasso Development and hosted in Davis, CA, USA.
