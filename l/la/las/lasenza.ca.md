This privacy policy explains what personal information is collected through this Website, how that information is used, to whom it’s disclosed, and how it’s safeguarded. Unless indicated otherwise, this policy applies only to personal information collected through the Website, microsites, or mobile sites of the La Senza brand and lines of business that expressly adopt, and display or link to, this policy. By "personal information" we mean identifiable information about you (like name, home address, email address, and descriptive information like tastes and preferences). We may refer to our brand and lines of business (i.e., La Senza) as "we," "us," or "our" throughout this privacy policy.

This privacy policy answers these questions

  * What personal information is collected at our Website, and how is it used?
  * How does this Website interact with third—party Websites and content?
  * What information do we share with third parties and our sister brands (or what information may they access because of the services they provide to us)?
  * What choices do you have over how your information is used?
  * How do you update your personal information?
  * How do you access your personal information?
  * How do we secure your information on our site?
  * Where is personal information stored and processed?
  * Whom should you contact with questions or concerns?
  * When was this policy last updated?



## What personal information is collected at our Website and how is it used?

1\. Information You Directly Provide through this Site

We collect personal information directly from you to do all the things typically associated with Websites. Examples of the information we collect include name, address, telephone number, mobile phone number, email address, personal preferences, credit card number, purchase and ordering information, demographical information, responses to survey questions and sizing information.

This information is collected at various places: for instance, when you check out with your online order; subscribe to catalogs, email offers, and mobile messaging offers; participate in surveys; join the Prestige VIP Club; enter contests or sweepstakes; or interact with special—event or program offers.

We may also collect information that you provide about people you know. For example, we collect your gift recipient’s contact information to process your gift orders. We use personally identifying information to do things like:

  * Process your online orders.
  * Open an online account at your request.
  * Personalize your online experience with content and offers that are tailored to your interests and purchase history.
  * Provide customer service, whether it’s responding to a request or following up on an order.
  * Include you in surveys and contests.
  * Enable you to post your content, such as comments or images.
  * Facilitate networks of online social activity centered around our products and services.
  * Improve our Website, improve the manner in which offers are made on our Website, improve purchase decisions of our visitors and the interactions that visitors have with our Website.
  * Enable you to interact with third—party content service providers, whether by linking to their sites, viewing their content within our Web environment, or by viewing our content within their Web environment.
  * Market products and services for our brand—for instance, by adding you to the La Senza email list when you make an online purchase.



2\. Information We Observe or Collect through Technology

a. Navigational Information

When you visit this Website, we collect navigational information, such as browser type and version, service—provider identification, IP address, the site from which you came, and the site to which you navigate. Navigational information doesn’t contain your name, address, phone number, email address or other information that directly identifies you. However, we may associate this navigational information with your personal information if you provide it.

b. Cookies and Clear gifs

To better understand what you do while on our site, we use a browser feature known as a cookie. A cookie is a small data file that’s stored by your Web browser on your computer. It’s used to do things like see how you navigate our Website, what you click on, and remember you and your online purchases when you return. This helps us improve our site, provide better customer service, personalize your online experience, and personalize offers to you based on your unique tastes and both your online and offline (e.g., in—store) interactions and purchase history.

We also use clear—gifs (also known as a Web beacon or Web bug) on our Website and in our emails. A clear gif is a nearly invisible pixel—sized graphic image on a Web page, Web—based document or e—mail message. It helps us do things like view the URL of the page on which the clear gif appears and the time our Website or email in question is viewed. Clear gifs in emails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails, including those that you forward to friends and family; and they help deliver a more personalized online experience. These technologies may be used to help us see which of our interactive experiences online users like most—for example, by keeping track of the number of times a video, widget or other media is accessed or embedded on social networking sites; and on which social networking sites it is embedded, based on inquiries that are sent to our Website. Cookies and clear gifs also allow us to associate your online navigational information, or purchases and interactions (both online and offline), with any personal information you provide (such as name, address, phone number, survey responses, and email address). We’ll associate this information to deliver products and services to you; to improve our business; to transact business; and to market our products and services on this and other Websites and through a variety of media like email, mobile advertising, and direct mail. As an example, we may use cookies to keep track of what you put into your shopping bag. That can help us contact you if your online session is disrupted in mid—purchase, resulting in an abandoned cart. We can also use this technology to determine whether you’d be interested in participating in special events, given your preferences. The end result is a more personalized experience that’s tailored to your needs and tastes.

3\. Information Others Observe or Collect through Technology

Third—party service providers help us provide certain features on our site and analyze our visitor’s site and purchase preferences. They may also help us deliver ads to you about our products through banner ads when you visit other Websites (often referred to as "online network advertising"). The following provides more information about these service providers and the choices you have with respect to their services.

> a. Features

> We contract with analytics companies to better understand your use of our Websites, and Web capabilities like embeddable widgets.

They accomplish this by using some or all of the technologies described in Information We Observe or Collect Through Technology.
> 
> c. Advertising
> 
> We contract with third—party advertising companies which may, in turn (1) place, use, and rely on, cookies and Web beacons when you interact with us through our Websites and our email; (2) help us determine which of our products you may like, based on both your online and offline (e.g., in—store) shopping histories with us; (3) use your basic personal information (such as name, address and email address) to help us associate your online and stores purchases and interactions through and with us; and (4) deliver personalized online display and banner advertising to you on other Websites, based on those purchases and interactions.

## How does this Website interact with third—party Websites and content?

We may enable you to navigate to third—party sites and services, or otherwise display third—party content. We do this for your convenience. We don’t endorse or generally have any affiliation with these third parties. And we don’t control and aren’t responsible for their Web practices. Whether the third—party content appears within our Web environment (like a map frame), or you leave our Website for another site to view it, those service provider’s terms, conditions, and privacy policies govern your online experience (unless there’s a conspicuously posted statement by us that says otherwise). Please view their terms of service and privacy policies, if you have any question about their practices.

Here’s a partial list of the sites or content of these third parties:

1\. Interactive Maps

We may facilitate easy access to the online maps of content providers like Google. There you can get quick location, driving, and contact information for our stores.

2\. Sweepstakes, Contests, and Survey Sites

We may rely on the expertise of third—party service providers to run sweepstakes, contests, and surveys. Navigation to these sites may be seamless so that it appears you’re still in our Website environment. In these cases, the third—party’s privacy policy may apply to any personal information you provide in connection with the event. So please take note of who’s running the event in question; and the terms, conditions, and policies that apply.

3\. Social Networking or Other User—Generated—Content Sites, and Other Websites

We may at times facilitate easy access to third—party sites, like social networking sites and other sites that host user—generated content. This may include easy click—through access or even "single sign—on" to these sites. The third—party’s privacy policy applies to any personal information you provide at these sites.

## What information do we share with third parties and our sister brands (or what information may they access because of the services they provide to us)?

1\. Our Sister Brands

We may also share the information described in this policy, like postal and email address, customer preferences, and purchase history within our corporate family so that our affiliates may market to you. Our affiliates include such brands as Bath & Body Works, Henri Bendel, and the Victoria’s Secret family of brands, including Pink.

2\. Contractors

We use third—party "back—office" contractors to help handle parts of our business on our behalf because of their expertise, resources, or scale. They help us do things like fulfill orders, process payments, provide some customer service through chat features, monitor site activity, serve surveys and provide analysis from the surveys (when combined with Website use), maintain databases, administer and monitor emails, (e.g., from La Senza), administer and send mobile messages (e.g., from La Senza), serve ads on this and other Websites as described above, and provide consulting services. Contractors may also assist us in hosting microsites and mobile Websites where you may provide personal information about you and others you know; and where they may observe information about you in the same way as described above (see What Personal Information Is Collected At Our Website, and How Is It Used?)

3\. Law Enforcement and Emergency Response

We or our service providers may disclose specific information about our Web—site visitors if we have a good—faith belief that it’s necessary or authorized under applicable law—for example, to (1) protect our customers, the public, or our business; (2) respond to a legally valid inquiry or order; (3) or respond to an investigative body in the case of a breach of an agreement or contravention of law.

4\. Sale or Merger

In the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business assets, including a brand or line of business, consumer information may be one of the business assets that are transferred in connection with the transaction. Nothing in this policy restricts our ability to share non—identifiable information.

## What choices do you have over how your information is used?

1\. Email

If you’re receiving La Senza commercial email, you may stop future delivery by following the removal instructions located at the bottom of each email or by completing the removal from e—mail form. Opting out of any of these emails will not stop operational or transactional messages such as email confirmations of your online orders, or customer service communications from the brand or line of business in question. We may occasionally provide you with the opportunity to opt in to receive email messages from third parties. If you do opt in, we’ll share your e—mail address with the specific third party in question. Please review their privacy policies to see how they treat your personal information.

2\. Mobile Messaging

If you’ve signed up for mobile text messaging offers but later decide you no longer wish to receive offers, simply follow the opt—out instructions included in the mobile message.

3\. Cookies, Clear Gifs, and Online Network Advertising

You may always choose to block cookies or even clear cookies from your computer. Simply follow your browser’s instructions on how to block and clear cookies. Note that blocking cookies may not block the "first—party" cookies that are placed on your computer when you visit this site. By first—party cookies, we mean those cookies (whether placed by us or a contractor) that help us see how visitors use our site, and enable us to deliver our ads on our Websites and other Websites. Otherwise, clearing cookies after each visit here will prevent observations from multiple sessions being aggregated over time. Please consider the consequences of blocking or clearing cookies. Many Websites rely on their cookies to provide you with services or features that you have requested or expect. If you decide to block cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all the features offered on our Website. With respect to cookies used as part of a survey, if you do not want the use of cookies to associate survey responses with your behavior on the site, you can elect to not take the survey. If you want to opt out of the display of our online advertising, which appears on other Websites, and which is based on the association of your online information with your offline information through interactions with us (purchase information, in particular), then please click the preference icon that may appear on such advertising. Additionally, if you want more information about online network advertising, in general, including access to some online network advertisers that allow you to designate your preferences, click here (you’ll then leave this site for a centrally managed online site where you may specify your preferences).
