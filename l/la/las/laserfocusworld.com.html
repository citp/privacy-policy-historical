        <h1>PennWell Corporation Online Privacy Policy</h1>
        <div class="genericBoxContent">
            <div style="font-style: italic">(Last updated Sept 4, 2003)</div>
            
            <p>Your privacy on the Internet is important to us at PennWell Corporation ("PennWell").  PennWell is committed to tailoring content to match 
            our user's individual needs, but we also recognize the importance of protecting the personally identifiable information we may collect about you, 
            our users. PennWell has developed this privacy policy in an attempt to balance our legitimate business interests in collecting and using information 
            with your reasonable expectations of privacy for your personal information provided to us while visiting any of our web sites.  Please review the entire 
            policy and feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@pennwell.com">webmaster</a> if you have any questions.  This policy may change from 
            time to time so please check back periodically so you are familiar with our current privacy policy.</p>
            
            <h2>PennWell's Collection of User Information</h2>
            
            <p>PennWell collects user information in various ways: personal information (e.g. name, e-mail address, mailing address, industry, occupation) that you 
            supply when registering for, subscribing to, bidding on, or purchasing services or products through our web sites 
            ("personally identifying information"), information that you provide regarding your interests, and activity and preference tracking information 
            from our use of "cookies" and other aggregate activity logging. PennWell does not collect personally identifying information from our users 
            other than what is supplied to us on a voluntary basis.</p>
            
            <p>A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and is stored on your computer's hard drive.  Cookies allow you to 
            enter your password less frequently during an online session and assist us in providing information to you that is targeted to your interests.  
            We may use a separate cookie to track each site's aggregated page views, which tells us which features are most interesting to our visitors.  
            You also may be served cookies from our advertisers while visiting our sites.  We do not control or have access to any information they may collect.  
            Our cookies do not store personally identifying information about you.  Since cookies are now used as industry standard, most web browsers automatically 
            accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to decline cookies.  If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to access certain 
            features on our sites.</p>
            
            <p>Our web sites log IP addresses and browser types (primarily for systems administration purposes), but we do not match IP addresses to any personally 
            identifiable information.  This means that your session will be tracked, but you can remain anonymous in the public areas of our sites.  You can browse 
            those areas of our sites without entering any personal information and therefore remain anonymous during your visit.  However, we hope that all of our 
            users will register with us so that you can utilize all of the product and service offerings available at our sites and so we can learn more about our 
            valuable customers and keep you updated.</p>
            
            <p>PennWell's web sites may contain links to other web sites. We encourage you to visit those web sites to learn more about their online privacy as 
            they may differ from this privacy policy. PennWell does not control the privacy policies of our advertisers, sponsors, or other sites to which we may 
            provide hyperlinks.</p>
            
            <h2>Use of Personal Information Collected</h2>
            
            <p>Personally identifying information that we collect may be added to our databases and used for future communications regarding site updates, new 
            products and services, upcoming events, and status of orders placed online.  The data that we collect from cookies and browser identification provides 
            demographic data about our audience in the aggregate that we use to improve our service and tailor our offerings.  Personal data may also be used for 
            editorial purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of users' behavior, for product development, for content 
            improvement, to inform advertisers as to how many visitors have seen or clicked on their advertisements, or to customize the content and layout of our 
            sites.</p>
            
            <h2>Sharing of Information with Third Parties</h2>
        
            <p>PennWell may provide personally identifiable information, voluntarily provided by visitors, to third parties who provide products and services that 
            PennWell believes our visitors may be interested in purchasing, obtaining, or learning more about.  Many visitors and subscribers find this a valuable 
            and time-saving service.  Unless you provide an "opt-out" notice, we may (and you authorize us to) provide your personally identifying 
            information as part of our visitor and subscriber lists for each such third party to use, if we believe our subscribers would be interested in 
            receiving an e-mail or other written correspondence from any such third party.  Regardless of any opt-out notice, we will provide your personally 
            identifiable information to third parties if we believe in good faith that the law requires us to do so or if it is necessary to protect the rights or 
            property of PennWell or our users.</p>
            
            <p>We share with our advertisers the data that we collect from cookies and other browser technology or IP addresses to help them better understand our 
            audience and to monitor the reach of their advertising.</p>
            
            <h2>User's Right to Opt-Out</h2>
            
            <p>In the event that you do not wish your personally identifying information to be used by third parties to send you information about products and 
            services, you may opt-out of this service by checking the "opt-out" box wherever provided.  In addition to such options made available to you 
            when we collect your personally identifying information, you may opt-out of this service at any time by mailing us a letter or sending us an e-mail 
            at the address below, specifying that you have elected to opt-out of any third party mailings.  Include your full name, address, and e-mail address 
            with your notice to: PennWell, Privacy Manager, 1421 S. Sheridan Road, Tulsa, OK 74112 or <a href="mailto:privacy@pennwell.com">privacy@pennwell.com</a>.
            We will update your records as promptly as practical; however, you may receive third-party communications while we process your request.</p>
        
            <h2>Updating Personal Information</h2>
            
            <p>If you would like to correct and/or update your personally identifying information or other information that you have supplied, please contact our 
            <a href="mailto:webmaster@pennwell.com">webmaster</a>.  Once we have updated your information, we will send a return e-mail indicating that the 
            requested changes have been made.</p>
            
            <h2>Security Features</h2>
            
            <p>PennWell has implemented a number of security features to prevent the unauthorized release of or access to personally identifying information, such 
            as firewalls and secure servers.  The secure server encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us.  Please be advised, however, that while 
            we have endeavored to create a secure and reliable site for our users, perfect security is not yet available on the Internet and the confidentiality 
            of any communication or material transmitted to or from us via our sites or e-mail cannot be 100% guaranteed.  Accordingly, we are not responsible for 
            the security of information transmitted via the Internet.  Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our 
            system.  Only authorized personnel have access to any stored personally identifying information which PennWell may collect from its users.</p>
        
            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            
            <p>It is important to us that we do our part to protect the privacy of children.  For this reason, we do not intentionally collect or maintain 
            information through our web sites from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our web site is designed to target or attract anyone 
            under 13.</p>
