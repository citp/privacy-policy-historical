# Lasvegassportsbetting.com Privacy

We aim to provide our clients with the highest levels of privacy. We collect only information needed to accurately pay your winnings and to provide you with the best service possible. We do not sell, trade, rent, or share the personal information you have entrusted us with. We use state-of-the-art security technologies to keep your credit card information safe. 

## Our clients utilize extensive security measures found within our software and gaming servers to protect all information sent over the Internet. Each account held with us is _subject to the following security measures_ : 

**Access to Funds**   
We maintain customer balances in cash. We ensure that each customer's balance is available for immediate withdrawal.

**Account Access**   
Our accounts are accessible only with a unique Username and Password combination. Please keep your Username and Password strictly confidential. We also suggest that you do not save your username or password to ANY computer. We accept no responsibility for any fraud resulting from the scenario described above. 

Upon activating an account, a client will be asked a number of questions as a security measure. If he/she forgets his/her account information the answers to these questions must be furnished correctly before we can re-issue the lost information. In the event that this information does not match, proof of identity will need to be submitted.

If it is such that your account was created before this policy was introduced, and there is no record of the security questions/answers the client will be asked to fax in a copy of some type of identification (suitable to ourselves). 

**Information Verification**  
All users must register with their full mailing address and full legal name when creating an account at us. Users that are found to have registered with a false name or mailing address are subject to having their account(s) locked until suitable proof of person is provided. 

**Withdrawal Verification**   
All withdrawals are subject to Username verification. A Username is automatically generated upon activating an account. Clients will be asked for the answers to their security questions before receiving a payout
