### ABOUT LASERSHIP PHOTO ON DELIVERY

LaserShip may take a photo on delivery when a package is left unattended. The photo will focus on the placement of the package and immediately disappears from the driver’s device. Capturing delivery photos is intended to help customers see that their package was safely delivered and where. If a photo on delivery is captured, it may show up when you track a package from lasership.com.

Accessing a delivery photo, to the extent this feature is or becomes available, requires signing in with your user name and password on the lasership.com website. We may use delivery photos to verify delivery location, audit for quality purposes, or troubleshoot what happened to a package.

  


### INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

LaserShip does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other individuals or nonaffiliated companies, except to the extent necessary to provide the services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of LaserShip's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.



We may transfer information about you if LaserShip is acquired by or merged with another company, including in the event of a reorganization, liquidation or dissolution. In this event, LaserShip will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

  


### HOW WE STORE AND SECURE YOUR INFORMATION

We use data hosting service providers in the United States to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data.

We will undertake reasonable steps to protect all information, from unauthorized or accidental access, disclosure, misuse or processing, or from alteration, destruction, or loss. However, because no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of information you submit to us.

  


### RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION

We may retain your questions and feedback in order to improve our services. Do not send us any information, ideas, suggestions, proposals or comments that you consider confidential or that you wish to be treated as confidential. If you no longer want us to use or retain personal information you provided to us, you may contact us [**click here**](https://web.archive.org/contact.php) and request that we delete that such personal information from our records.

Your personal information will not be stored for longer than is necessary for which it was collected or as required under applicable retention policies or practices, or as otherwise may be permitted or required in accordance with applicable law.

  


### COOKIES

LaserShip may set and access LaserShip cookies on your computer. A "cookie" is a text file that websites send to a visitor's computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser.

LaserShip may link certain data elements we have collected through cookies, such as your browser information, with other information we have obtained about you. LaserShip also may use third-party analytics tools that collect information about visitor traffic on our websites or apps.

Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our websites or apps.

  


### MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS

You can choose to opt-out from receiving marketing communications from us at this stage or, at any time, by sending us a message with your request. [**Click here**](https://web.archive.org/contact.php) to contact us.

  


### CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY

We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide services to you or in order to do their jobs. However, information that is located on the outside of a package or letter may be visible to others.

We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you. Depending on your user status, your LaserShip Account Information may be password-protected. In certain areas LaserShip may use industry-standard SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions.

  


### INTERNATIONAL USERS

The website is hosted, and the services are performed in the U.S. and are intended for U.S. customers. If you are physically located in one of the 28 European Union Countries, please do not submit any personal information to us. If you believe you may have disclosed personally identifiable information to us, please contact us at (see the How to Contact Us link below) and we will remove it. If you are a consumer accessing the website or our services from Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use and disclosure that differ from U.S. laws, your continued use of our website or services, which are governed by U.S. law and these terms, indicates your consent to transfer of your information to the U.S.

  


### CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

Because protecting the privacy of young children is especially important, we do not knowingly collect or maintain information from or about persons under 13 years of age. No part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. If you are under 13, do not use or access the website at any time or in any manner. If we learn that personal information of persons under 13 has been collected without verified parental consent, we will take appropriate steps to delete this information.

  


### YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS (FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ONLY)

Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code requires select businesses to disclose policies relating to the sharing of certain categories of customers' personal information with third parties. These businesses are required to accept requests for disclosures of these policies from customers but are only required to honor one request per calendar year. Businesses have thirty (30) days to respond to each inquiry to the designated address. Each inquiring customer will receive an explanation of the categories of customer information shared and the names and addresses of any third party businesses. In limited circumstances, customers' failure to submit requests in the manner specified will not require a response from the business.

If you are a California resident, you may request such information from us by sending a letter to the address listed below. In your letter, please provide your name, address and email address, as well as a request that we provide such information to you, by using the following or similar language, “I request that LaserShip provide its third-party information sharing disclosures required by section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code.”
