## 10. Privacy notice for Facebook

 **10.1. Facebook Custom Audiences - Facebook pixel  **

We use the remarketing function “Custom Audiences” of Facebook Inc. (1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, California 94025) or, if you are based in the EU, Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland. This function allows us to show our Users and/or Customers of our website interest-based ads when they visit Facebook (“Facebook ads”), and to analyze such Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes, which helps us optimize future advertising. This allows us to serve more relevant advertising. 

For this purpose we use the so-called Facebook pixel for our website. 

When a User or a Customer visits our website and takes an action (for example, buying something), the Facebook pixel is triggered and reports this action. This way, we will know when a customer took an action after seeing our Facebook ad. We will also be able to reach this customer again by using a Custom Audience. Therefore, this pixel allows user behavior to be tracked after they have been redirected to our Website by clicking on a Facebook ad. This way, we will know when a customer took an action after seeing our Facebook ad. We will also be able to reach this customer again by using a Custom Audience. 

Therefore, this enables us to measure the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes. The data collected in this way is anonymous to us, i.e. we do not see the personal data of individual users. However, this data is stored and processed by Facebook, which is why we are informing you, based on our knowledge of the situation. Facebook may link this information to your Facebook account and also use it for its own promotional purposes, in accordance with Facebook’s Data Usage Policy https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy. Such data may allow Facebook and its partners to show ads on or off Facebook. A cookie may also be stored on your computer for these purposes. 

 **10.2. Facebook SDK**

Within our App, we use the Software Development Kit (SDK) from Facebook. The Facebook SDK is issued and administered by Facebook Inc, 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA, or, if you are based in the EU, Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland. By means of this integration, we can link various Facebook services with our App (i.e. Facebook Analytics, Facebook Ads, Facebook Login via the SDK, Facebook Account Ki, Facebook Share, Facebook Graph API and Facebook App Events). 

In particular, we have linked the following SDK Facebook services with our App: 

 **Facebook Login** : to provide you with the possibility to register or log in with your Facebook account 

**Facebook App Events** : To understand people's actions in our app and measure the effectiveness of your Mobile App Ads. We use this service to evaluate the reach of our advertising campaigns and use of Facebook SDK. Facebook merely provides us with an aggregated analysis of user behavior within our app. 

In addition, as our App is linked to SDK Facebook services, we have to follow Facebook policies, which include that we are obliged to share with Facebook, when you download the App, even when you are not logged in to the social media platform, the following data:
