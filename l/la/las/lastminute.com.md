### 4\. Who do we share your information with and why

We are happy to say that we are not in the business of selling or renting your personal information to third parties. lastminute.com does however share your personal information with its group companies or carefully selected third party partners and providers as necessary for business administration, customer delivery, marketing and operational, analytical, quality assurance and, though only in relation to anonymised data, marketing assistance (for example, to explore consumer trends) or other purposes as set out below. Except with your expressly given consent, we will only share your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. To the extent that any third party has access to your personal information to provide functions on our behalf, their use of this information will be limited solely to providing those functions and for no other purpose.

  * Third party suppliers and group companies: lastminute.com engages other group companies and/or carefully selected third party partners, including service providers, joint venture partners and outsource providers to perform various functions on our behalf. To the extent required to perform such functions on our behalf, these companies may process your personal information. Such functions are processing bookings and confirming reservations for products and services and providing associated information (for example, local area information relating to a hotel booking), delivering products and services, processing credit card payments, providing search results, communicating with you, including providing customer service, via telephone, email, post or otherwise and, with your consent, for promotional activities.



Any personal information processed by our group companies will be in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy or similarly stringent conditions and as permitted under applicable data protection laws. We place contractual restrictions on our non-group third party partners who receive your personal information, to ensure that they use this in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable data protection laws.

Please note that our group companies and third party suppliers may be established in countries that might not offer a level of protection for your personal information that is equivalent to the one offered in your country of residence. However, we will endeavour to protect all personal information we collect from you in accordance with strict data protection standards.

  * Business restructuring: Like any other organisation, from time to time lastminute.com may restructure its business operations by selling one or more of its businesses (or part of a business) to a buyer either within or outside the lastminute.com group. In such transactions, your personal information could be transferred as part of the relevant sale. 
  

  * Compliance with laws and regulations: We may disclose your personal information to third parties, such as official bodies and our professional advisers, as far as we believe it is necessary (i) to comply with relevant laws, orders or regulations; (ii) to enforce our customer terms and conditions of use or other contractual agreements; and (iii) to protect the property and other rights of lastminute.com, its group companies, customers and others (for example, in any way relating to protection against fraudulent activities in respect of lastminute.com). 
  

  * Credit reference agencies and payment processors: When you make a booking or purchase products or services offered on our website, we will automatically pass certain personal information which you provide to us (for example, your name, credit card, billing address details) to third party credit reference agencies, payment processors or other third parties for the specific purpose of verifying that information. If your personal information cannot be satisfactorily verified (for example, your stated billing address does not match your credit card details), we will contact you to notify you that your purchase request has not been confirmed and to request corrected details, if they can be provided, before we can process your order. 

  


### 5\. Transfers outside the UK

In order to process your data as described in this privacy policy, we may need to send your information internationally including to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) for example, to our data centre in Lewisville, Texas, USA. Some of these jurisdictions offer differing levels of protection in respect of personal information and may, in certain instances, be less protective than data protection requirements of the country where we are based. We will however take steps to ensure that your personal information is transferred, stored and processed in accordance with appropriate security standards and in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and applicable data protection laws.

  


### 6\. How do we keep your personal information secure?

We use leading technological and security measures (electronic, physical and procedural) to ensure the safety and confidentiality of your personal information through collection, storage and disclosure. Such measures include maintaining a secure encryption based transmission system, intrusion detection and prevention software and virus protection software in respect of personal information. Other than as strictly required by our payment providers and by our credit card companies to process payments, lastminute.com reveals only the last 5 digits of your stored credit card number to authorised personnel only.

  


### 7\. How can you control your personal information? 

lastminute.com understands that it is important that you have control over your personal information. You can view and change your account settings and information, at any time by accessing your account and updating the details. If you do not want to receive special offers and promotional communications from lastminute.com you can set your preferences to opt out via our preference centre if it is available in your region or by using the unsubscribe link at the bottom of emails you receive from us.
