We take your privacy very seriously and are committed to being transparent with how we use your information. Www.LastYearTheGame.com (collectively “We” or “us”) receives information from users through Www.LastYearTheGame.com, associated sites and forums, our Games (including Last Year) and any associated mobile or web apps.

**Our Privacy Policy explains:**

– What information we collect and why we collect it.  
– How we use that information.  
– With whom we share that information and under what conditions.  
– The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: [info@lastyearthegame.com](mailto:info@lastyearthegame.com)

**Information we collect:**

We collect information to provide better services to our users and improve our business.  
We collect information in two ways:

**Information you give us**

For example, many of our services require you to sign up for an account. When you sign up for an account, we will ask you for simple personal information including your name, email and similar information. This information and the specific information listed below may also be collected as needed when you join a new mailing list, contact our support services or take part in a competition we run.

**Optional Account Information**

When creating an account with some of our services (such as our forums), you may be given the option to share additional information about yourself, including date of birth, sex, location, occupation, physical address and account names with third party communication services such as Skype, Steam, MSN, AIM, Yahoo Messenger, XFire etc.

**Third-party account information**

Some features of our sites, services, games and associated apps, such as matchmaking, achievements and leaderboards, require connection to third-party networks such as Steam. We may collect your account information (both username and password) for these third-party networks for the purposes of connecting to said services and providing the associated features.

**Information we get from your use of our services**

We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you visit different parts of our applications and what selections you make on the website. Our sites may use cookies to collect information about your use of our site, although no personally identifiable information other than age (stored only for the purpose of restricting access to underage users – see below) such as name or location, etc will be stored in a cookie. We may also automatically collect certain technical information such as:

**Location Information**

We may collect location information tied to orders placed through our site for the purpose of internal sales analysis. This data is only used internally and is not shared and is not stored in cookies.

**Device information**

We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile information if you use a mobile device to access the site and use your mobile device for our application).

**Log information**

When you use our services or view content provided by us, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This information may include:  
– Details of how you used our service, such as your navigation paths and search queries.  
– Mobile related information if you access our website using your mobile device.  
– Internet protocol address.  
– Device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.  
– Cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account.

**How we use information we collect**

We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve our services, to develop new services and offerings and to protect us and our users. We may also use this information to offer you tailored content like giving you more relevant search results and ads.

We may also use this information to send you marketing communications including promotions, coupons, newsletters and other advertising materials. Such marketing materials may be sent through third party vendors with whom we may share the information, but only for the purposes of such marketing. These third party vendors (such as MailChimp) have their own privacy policies, which may differ from ours and can be accessed separately on their respective sites. Payment information is used only to process payments for purchases you make through our site or software.

When you contact us, we may keep a record of your communication as well as other information referenced in this Privacy Policy to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.

We will ask for your consent before using personal information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.

**Choice**

If we provide you with any mailings or other communication, you can always opt out of that communication.

You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us. However, it’s important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. Certain parts of the site may require age verification (stored in a cookie) to view, and may not be accessible with cookies disabled.

**Accessing and updating your personal information**

Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information in your account. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.

If you feel that any information we have collected from you is in error, you may edit your account information either directly at [Edit profile](https://web.archive.org/wp-admin/profile.php) or by contacting an administrator with your concerns. If this does not resolve your issue or you prefer to use email, you may contact us at: info@lastyearthegame.com
