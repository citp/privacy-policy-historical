The Los Angeles County Sheriff Department may ask visitors who request specific information to fill out a form. For example, when requesting information about a crime report, civil process, weapon permits, or other subjects, the visitors may be asked to provide their names, addresses, e-mail addresses and other pertinent information to ensure we can process and deliver the information requested. Other information may be collected at these sites through questionnaires, feedback forms or other means to enable us to determine a visitor's interests with the goal of providing better service.

If you choose not to provide us with your name or other information, it may be impossible for us to refer, respond to, or investigate the issue you are concerned about.
