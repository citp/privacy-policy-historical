  	<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
  	  To   facilitate your use of our website, we may use “cookies.” A cookie is small   amount of data that our servers transfer to your browser and that only our   servers can read.

  	<p><strong>Non-Disclosure </strong><br>
  	  LASHBACK will not sell or rent your Personal Information, nor will   LASHBACK provide to third parties your Personal Information unless LASHBACK has   your consent (which LASHBACK may infer has been granted based on circumstances   of use of Lashback.com and specific product requests) and (1) sharing your   Personal Information is required to provide the product or service you have   requested, or (2) LASHBACK needs to send your Personal Information to companies   which work on its behalf in order to provide you a product or service (which   companies will not have any right to use your Personal Information we share with   them beyond what is necessary to assist LASHBACK).

  	<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
  	  We   employ procedural and technological measures, consistent with the demands of   customer service, reasonably designed to protect your personally identifiable   information from loss or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or   destruction.

  	<p>Safe Harbor Privacy Statement</p>
  	<p><strong>SafeSafe   Harbor Standards</strong><br>
  	  This Safe Harbor Privacy Statement (the   "Statement") sets forth the privacy principles followed by LashBack Inc.   (LASHBACK) in connection with the transfer and protection of "personal   information" received from the European Union (EU) or Switzerland. </p>
  	<p><strong>About The   Safe Harbor</strong><br>
  	  The "Safe Harbor" program was   jointly established in June 2000 by the United States Department of Commerce and   the European Commission, as a method for transferring personal information from   the European Union (EU), to companies in the United States. The program is a   voluntary self-certification process for companies operating in the United   States. Companies that certify represent that they are upholding privacy   standards for personal information received from the EU that have been jointly   accepted by the EU Commission and the US Department of Commerce. These standards   exceed current US privacy standards. LASHBACK has certified to the Safe Harbor   program and makes that commitment. </p>
  	<p>"Personal   Information" means information that can directly or indirectly lead to the   identification of a living person, such as an individual's name, address,   e-mail, telephone number, license number, medical identification number,   photograph, or other identifying characteristic. The identification can occur by   reference to one or more factors specific to the individual's physical,   physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity. Personal   information does not include information that has been anonymized, encoded or   otherwise stripped of its identifiers, or information that is publicly   available, unless combined with other non-public personal information. </p>
  	<p><strong>Scope</strong><br>
  	  This Statement governs   personal information transferred from countries in the EU or Switzerland (which   has adopted substantially similar privacy laws to those of the EU), to the   United States on behalf of LASHBACK. It applies to personal information in   electronic and off-line formats.</p>
  	<p><strong>Safe Harbor   Privacy Principles</strong><br>
  	  The following privacy principles   apply to the transfer, collection, use or disclosure of personal information   from the EU by LASHBACK.</p>
  	<p><strong>Notice:</strong> LASHBACK   informs individuals in the EU about the purposes for which it collects and uses   their personal information, how to contact LASHBACK, the types of third parties   with which LASHBACK shares their personal information, and the choice and means   LASHBACK offers for limiting the use and disclosure of their personal   information. </p>
  	<p>Consistent with the   Safe Harbor requirements, LASHBACK may not be in a position to furnish notice in   certain limited situations. Specifically, notice is not required where the   processing of EU personal information is necessary to respond to a government   inquiry; is required by applicable laws, court orders or government regulations;   or is necessary to protect LASHBACK' legal interests and providing notice would   interfere with those interests. </p>
  	<p><strong>Choice:</strong> LASHBACK   will not process personal information about EU individuals for purposes other   than those for which the information was originally obtained or subsequently   authorized by the EU individual unless the individual affirmatively and   explicitly consents ("opt-in") to the processing, or unless an exception   applies. LASHBACK also provides EU individuals with the opportunity to withdraw   consent at any time ("opt-out"), in which case their personal information will   not be further processed. There are certain limitations on the right to opt-out,   such as those that apply in the clinical research situation. In that situation,   LASHBACK can continue to rely upon personal information already provided by   clinical research participants who choose to discontinue participation in a   clinical trial, to the extent needed to protect the integrity of the study, but   cannot collect any additional personal information about that individual once   the written request to withdraw participation is received. </p>
  	<p><strong>Data   Integrity:</strong> LASHBACK seeks to ensure that any personal information held   about EU individuals is accurate, complete, current and otherwise reliable in   relation to the purposes for which the information was obtained. LASHBACK   collects personal information that is adequate, relevant and not excessive for   the purposes for which it is to be processed. EU individuals have a   responsibility to assist LASHBACK in maintaining accurate, complete and current   personal information about them. </p>
  	<p><strong>Transfers   To Third Parties:</strong> LASHBACK will only transfer personal information   about EU individuals to third-parties where the third-party (a) has provided   satisfactory assurances to LASHBACK that it will protect the information   consistently with this Statement; or (b) is located in the EU or a country   considered "adequate" for privacy by the EU Commission, and therefore is   required to comply with the EU data protection laws or substantially equivalent   privacy laws; or (c) the third-party has also certified to the Safe Harbor, and   is accordingly independently responsible for complying with the Safe Harbor   requirements. </p>
  	<p>Where LASHBACK has   knowledge that a third-party to whom it has provided EU personal information is   processing that information in a manner contrary to this Statement or the Safe   Harbor requirements, LASHBACK will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the   processing. </p>
  	<p><strong>Access And   Correction:</strong> Upon written request to LASHBACK, LASHBACK will provide EU   individuals with reasonable access to their personal information. LASHBACK will   also take reasonable steps to allow EU individuals to review their information   for the purposes of correcting their information. There are certain limitations   to the Access and Correction rights, as set forth in the US Department of   Commerce's Safe Harbor website. </p>
  	<p><strong>Security:</strong> LASHBACK   takes reasonable precautions to protect EU personal information in its   possession from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and   destruction. </p>
  	<p><strong>Enforcement:</strong> LASHBACK has established internal mechanisms to verify its ongoing adherence to   this Statement. LASHBACK also encourages individuals covered by this Statement   to raise any concerns about our processing of their personal information by   contacting LASHBACK' Privacy Office at the address below or by contacting their   local privacy officer or Legal Department. LASHBACK will seek to resolve any   concerns. LASHBACK has also agreed to participate in the dispute resolution   program provided by the European Data Protection Authorities. </p>
  	<p><strong>Limitation   On Scope Of Principles:</strong> Adherence to these Privacy Principles may be   limited to the extent required to meet a legal, governmental, national security   or public interest obligation. </p>
  	<p><strong>Contact   Information:</strong> Questions or comments about this Statement should be   directed to:<br>
