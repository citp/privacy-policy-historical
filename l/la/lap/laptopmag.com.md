Privacy Policy

Please read this carefully before using the Website (that is, any site operated by Bedford Communications). It is your responsibility to read the Privacy Policy.

**The Basic Principles**  
By accessing and using the Website you are agreeing to be legally bound by the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. You should therefore also read the Terms of Use before using the Website. 

Bedford Communications is determined to protect your privacy. It is very important to us that you should be able to use and enjoy the Website without having to compromise your privacy unacceptably. 

**Information Collection**  
We automatically collect some data about our users' browsing actions and patterns. This is aggregate data and does not identify any individual. We may, however, ask you to provide personal information on a voluntary basis in order to get a clearer picture of our users. It is then entirely up to you whether or not you wish to divulge such information. 

In the course of entering competitions, promotions and other online offers you will be asked to give some details about yourself. You may also choose to e-mail us or get in contact with us in other ways; such contact gives us information about yourself. 

Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.

We use aggregate audience details (where no individual is identifiable) to help us improve our understanding of our users and their preferences. We use this to assist us in arranging relevant advertising, commercial opportunities and competitions, as well as ensuring the best editorial coverage. It also enhances our ability to develop the Website and audit its use.

To enable the purchase of magazine subscriptions, the Website collects and stores billing and credit card information. This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.

**Choice/Opt-out**  
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to the Website at the point where we ask for information. 

**Legal Disclaimer**  
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law, wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on the Website.

**Further Information**  
If you have any comments, would like further information, or wish to communicate with us about this Privacy Policy and your wishes about your personal information, please e-mail us at [webeditor@bedfordmags.com](mailto:webeditor@bedfordmags.com).
