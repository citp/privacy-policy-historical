# LA Fitness | Privacy Policy

Fitness International, LLC (the "Company") is committed to providing users of its Services with an understanding of how the Company gathers and uses information, as well as the precautions taken by the Company to protect information concerning its Users. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is a part of the Terms and Conditions of Use; it describes the Company's policies and procedures for the collection and use of personal information provided by the User as well as non-personally identifiable information. 

Personally identifiable information 

The Company collects personally identifiable information directly from the User only when the User voluntarily enters information, or when the User requests or agrees that the Company send the User information or materials. The Company may also collect information through the use of promotional email campaigns or newsletters. 

The types of personally identifiable information the Company collects include e-mail address, full name, full address, work, home or mobile phone numbers, age, gender and viewing preferences. The Company currently uses the information for the purposes of providing the User with information requested by the User, and service information, and to allow the User to voluntarily participate in events, promotions, contests or sweepstakes. The Company may also use personally identifiable information to process user requests and/or to send the User communications from the Company such as news, information and promotional offers. If the User requests information for certain offers, promotions, contests or sweepstakes, the Company may forward the User's personal information to a third party for the purposes of supporting the Company in these services. 

The Company may disclose your personal and account information to respond to court subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes, as required by law, or to establish or exercise the Company’s legal rights or defend against legal claims. Your personal and account information may also be disclosed in connection with a sale of some or all of the Company’s business or a merger with another entity. Within the Company, we restrict access to information and data about you to those Company employees who need to know the information and data in order to perform their jobs, such as servicing your account, or notifying you of new services, classes, and programs. 

Your Obligations

For your protection, the Company strongly recommends that you do not share your account information, passwords or code words with others. Administrators of the Services will never ask you for your password by phone or e-mail. Do not provide confidential information online or over the telephone unless you initiated the contact, know the party with whom you are dealing, and provide the information through a secured channel. When conducting business over the Internet, always use a secure browser or client and exit online applications as soon as you finish using them. If you become aware of any suspicious activity relating to your account, it is your responsibility to contact the Company immediately. 

Security of Personally Identifiable Information 

To protect your personal information, we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to ensure online data and information privacy and security. We also use the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol to encrypt sensitive information (e.g. credit card number or password) over the Internet. However, the Company cannot guarantee the privacy and security of any information or data that is disclosed online.

User Comments

The Services, including the Company’s Internet sites, the Company’s mobile applications and third party websites that the Company may use to host Company bulletin boards, comments pages or other areas identified as administered by the Company will occasionally allow User to post comments. By posting comments, the User understands that a representative of the Company may contact the User regarding posted comments through contact information provided by the User, including any User provided e-mail address. 

Use of Cookies and non-personally identifiable information

By using the Services, the User makes available to the Company certain non-personally identifiable information (such as the domain name and type of the User's Internet server and browser or device, which pages or features of the Services the User accesses, and the length of access). This statement explains how the Company uses such information, and how the User can restrict the use and collection of non-personally identifiable information from "cookies." 

A "cookie" is a bit of text information stored on the hard drive of your computer by an Internet web server when you visit or use the Services. The User can choose not to accept cookies, but in so doing, the User may not be able to access certain features on the Services. Refer to the Help information in your browser or Internet provider site or software for instructions on how to disable cookies, or to be notified when a cookie is set. The Company may use "cookies" or store information on your device to track usage of the Services, User interactions with the Services, and to customize the Services.

The Company may use the non-personally identifiable information that is collected by the Company to improve the design and content of the Company's Services and to enable the Company to personalize your Internet or mobile application experience. Also, the Company may use this information in the aggregate to analyze usage of the Services, as well as to offer user products, programs, or other services.

Privacy and Our Apps or Website Features

The Company offers a number of apps or website features intended to make it easier for you to access our Services on your mobile device or the Internet. By using some of these apps or website features, you authorize us to display to others certain information about you. (We will never provide other members or users with your contact details.) We will tell you in the app or website feature what information, if any, may be disclosed, and you can always decide that app or website feature isn’t for you. You also can stop using the app or website feature by following the instructions within the app or website feature, at which point any further disclosures of information will stop as well.

Links to Other Sites

The Services may contain links to other Internet sites or resources that are owned and operated by third parties. The Company is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of Internet sites or resources owned and operated by third parties. The Company strongly suggests that you review such third party Internet sites or resource privacy policies before providing any data or information to them.

Changes or Deletions to Your Information

As an added protection to the User's privacy concerning personally identifiable information collected by the Company, the User may request that his or her personally identifiable information be changed, corrected or deleted from our databases by writing us at: Chief Privacy Officer, Fitness International, LLC P.O. BOX 54170, Irvine, CA 92619-4107, or by accessing the "contact us" link on our homepage. We reserve the right, consistent with applicable law, to preserve information necessary to enforce our rights or to comply with a lawful order, subpoena or other legal requirement.
