For more details, please review the section below entitled **“Will LAFS share any of the information it collects?”**

**Third party networks and analytics providers:** LAFS does not currently host advertisements on the Services. However, we work with analytics service providers and other third parties to provide us with information regarding traffic on the Services, including the pages viewed and the actions users take when visiting the Services; to serve our advertisements on other web sites, within mobile Apps, and elsewhere online; and to provide us with information regarding the use of the Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. For example, if you click on a LAFS advertisement, our service provider(s) may be able to tell us the advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement. 

Our analytics service providers and other vendors may set and access their own tracking devices (including **cookies** and **web beacons** ) and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you and your visits to and activity on the Services, as well as on other web sites or online services. Some of these parties may collect Personal Information when you visit the Services or other websites and services.

## 2\. Information LAFS Collects

### Information Shared With Us

**1\. Registration and Other Information You Provide**  
The Services may collect “Personal Information” (which is information that can reasonably be used, alone or in combination with other reasonably available information, to identify or contact a specific individual). Personal Information includes, but is not limited to your name, email address, phone number, physical address or zip code, account information (such as a password or other information that helps us confirm that it is you accessing your account) and demographic or other information (such as your gender, age or birthdate) and information about your interests and preferences. Any information combined with Personal Information will be treated as Personal Information. Please note that if you access the Services via Single Sign On through a university or other account, the Personal Information collected by LAFS may vary. 

**2\. Your Profile, Community Forums and User Content**  
**_Your Profile:_** You may have the opportunity to create a profile, which consists of information about you (“Profile”). Some of the information in your Profile may be visible to third parties or to everyone. LAFS may also make the information contained in your Profile accessible through means other than the Services (such as through an app or an application programming interface (API)). We do not control how frequently third-party search engines update their indexes; consequently, their information may be outdated and still available for a period of time even if you discontinue use of the Service.

**Note that in order to provide services and opportunities to you, educational organizations, scholarship providers and other third parties may (to the extent permissible by law) be able to review certain information in your Profile for some of the Services, whether or not you have limited public access to that information. You may have the opportunity to control whether this information is shared, but some information may be shared automatically — all as disclosed on the website or other service where you created your Profile. LAFS does not share your contact information (email, full postal address or phone number) with those third parties unless you request or agree to that sharing.**

**_Community Forums:_** The Services may provide you the opportunity to participate and post content publicly in forums, through interactive features and through other communication functionality (“Community Forums”). You may choose, through such features or otherwise, to submit or post reviews, suggestions, ideas, questions, answers, comments, testimonials, feedback, messages, images, videos, text or other material (“User Content”). Your User Content may also be posted in your Profile. Please think carefully about what you post and before including Personal Information in your User Content. You may edit or remove your Profile information, but you may not be able to remove answers or postings or other uploaded User Content on some Services. To request removal of content you posted publicly on the Services, contact us via email by clicking [here](mailto:privacy@lafilm.edu). To the extent possible under applicable law and regulatory standards, we will honor removal requests received from registered users under the age of 18 or not yet enrolled in **LAFS** or where required by law. Other removal requests received, may, in our sole discretion, be honored or refused (except that all such requests will be considered in the context of all applicable laws and regulations). In some cases, we may remove only your Personal Information but maintain the rest of your User Content. Note that removal of public postings does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information posted.

**_Note that anything you post to a Community Forum may be public (or at least viewable by others at LAFS)_. If you choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information in your Profile or a Community Forum, that information will be considered public information and the protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply.**

In addition, the Services may allow members to communicate and collaborate with each other, including some Services that allow members to engage in one-on-one communication using a video chat or text chat feature. If you create an account, participate in a Community Forum or choose to communicate with others through the Services, certain information about you may be disclosed in connection with your or others’ use of the Services, including certain information about you and your network (such as your name and profile photo, the number of your connections, and the names and pictures of your connections). Our servers may record and we may retain records of the content of any such user-to-user communications. 

## 3\. Third Party Services, Social Media Platforms, and Information Third Parties Provide About You

Third parties may provide us with information about you. For example, if you are on a third party web site, and you opt-in to receive information from us, that third party will forward information about you to us so that we may contact you as requested.

The Services may permit interactions between the Services and a third party web site or service, such as enabling you to “like” a product within our Services or “share” content to other web sites. If you choose to “like” or “share” content or to otherwise post information from or via the Services to a third party web site, feature or application, that information may be publicly displayed, and the third party web site may have access to information about you and your use of our Services. Similarly, if you publically post information on a third party platform that references LAFS or one of the Services, your post may be published on our Services in accordance with terms of that third party. These features may collect your IP address or other Device Identifier, which page you are visiting on our web site, and may set a cookie to enable the third party feature to function properly. Third party features and applications are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy(ies) of the company(ies) providing it.

You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature through our Services (such as logging in through Facebook Connect or otherwise linking the Services with another web site or interactive service) or on a third party web site or service (such as one of our Facebook applications or a similar application or feature on a third party web site or service) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Personal Information. Information about you, including your name and profile photo, may be shown to other users of the Services if you are logged in through the Services or through a third party web site or service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected. When you choose to participate, you may be opting to link your activity on our Services with that third party web site or service, which may then collect information about your visits to our Services and may publish that activity as you request to your profile or similar feature with that third party. In some instances, we may require that you participate in the Services through a third party application or feature and, if you choose not to authorize or use the required third party application or feature, you will not be able to use the applicable Service.

The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party’s privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party web site and service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected in compliance with all applicable laws.

To the extent permissible by law, we also may supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties in order to provide you with information, services or goods you have requested, to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Services. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.

## 4\. Referral Features 

The Services may offer referral features whereby users may use an email tool to invite friends to use the Services using a one-time email. LAFS stores this information for the purpose of verification, as well as tracking the success of our referral program. LAFS will not use those referred email addresses for any other purpose (unless, of course, the referred user comes to a Service and registers as a user, in which case we may use the email address provided by the referred user in accordance with this Privacy Policy). The referred person may contact us via email at ‘[privacy@lafilm.edu](mailto:privacy@lafilm.edu)‘ to request that we remove this information from our active database.

### Information We Collect Automatically

Like other web sites and online services, we and our analytics providers, vendors and other third party service providers may automatically collect certain “Usage Information” whenever you access and use the Services, including, without limitation, by viewing information about a course or school, exploring academic programs and co-curricular opportunities in a school, exploring career options, viewing information about potential employers, asking or answering questions, viewing another user’s Profile, sending a message, searching for a person or information, or by clicking on an advertisement.

Usage Information may include the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to our Services (if applicable), the search terms you entered into a search engine that lead you to our Services (if applicable), all of the areas within our Services that you visit (including information about any ads you may view), and the time of day you used the Services, among other information. We may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to tell you about people or events nearby, to provide special offers, to serve advertisements, to select appropriate content to display to you, and to enhance or otherwise improve the Services and our products.

In addition, we automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for any computer, mobile phone or other device (any, a “Device”) you may use to access the Services. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access a Service, and our servers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access a Service, internet service provider (ISP), date and time of your visit, browser language, browser type, referring and exit pages and URLs, amount of time spent on particular pages, which parts of our Services you use, which links you click, search terms, operating system, traffic and related statistics, keywords, and/or other general browsing or usage data.. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information.

**Usage Information is collected via tracking technologies, including:**

**1\. Cookies:** Our Services may utilize Cookies to improve your current and future experience by allowing us to understand your usage of our Services. For example, cookies help our systems recognize you if you return to our Services shortly after exiting them. Cookies are small text files stored on your computer that allow us to personalize the content of our Services. Cookies can be turned off via your browser settings if you so choose. However, if you turn your cookies off, some features of our Services may not function properly. In our Products, we use local storage to help remember your settings and account configuration. 

**2\. Web Beacons:** We, as well as our affiliate program partners, service providers, and other third parties, may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons/web bugs), that help us better manage content on our Services by informing us of what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users for our affiliate program. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. This information is used to help improve the overall quality and experience of our Services. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ Personal Information.

**3\. An Embedded Script:** is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device from our server or a third party service provider and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Services.

In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes.

**4\. Flash & HTML5:** We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store content, information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 & Flash to collect and store information.

Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To manage Flash LSOs please click here:  
[http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html ](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html)

**How We Respond To Do Not Track Signals:**  
Please note that your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” (DNT) signal to websites and online service you visit. DNT is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the internet industry is still working to determine what DNT means, how to comply with DNT, and how to create a common approach to responding to DNT. To find out more about “Do Not Track”, please visit <https://allaboutdnt.com/>.

## 3\. Use of Personal Information

We may use information about you, including Personal Information, the information you provide in your Profile, User Content, and Usage Information to: 

(1) Allow you to participate in features we offer or to provide related support, including, without limitation, to respond to your questions, complaints or comments;  
(2) Tailor content, recommendations and offers we display to you, both on the Services and elsewhere online;

Note that we may create, facilitate or display social advertisements, whereby your name and profile photo may be used to advertise products and services to your network based on your use of the Services and your interactions with LAFS and third parties through the Services (a “Social Ad”). If we are utilizing Social Ads on one of our Services, you will be able to opt-out through your account settings for that Service.

Please note that information submitted on the Services via a “Contact Us” or other similar function may not receive a response. We will not use the information provided via these functions to contact you for marketing purposes unrelated to your request unless you agree otherwise.

**Third Party Networks and Analytics Providers**  
We work with analytics service providers and other vendors to provide us with information regarding traffic on the Services, including the pages viewed and the actions users take when visiting the Services; to serve our advertisements on other websites, within mobile apps, and elsewhere online; and to provide us with information regarding the use of the Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. For example, if you click on a LAFS advertisement, our service provider(s) may be able to tell us the advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement. LAFS does not currently serve advertisements on or through the Services.

Some of the companies who serve these targeted ads participate in a self-regulatory program that allows you to opt-out of having information about you used for this purpose, and you may access that opt-out by clicking here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads while online. We may share Usage Information about visitors with analytics providers and other vendors. Our analytics service providers and other vendors may set and access their own tracking devices (including cookies and web beacons) and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you and your online browsing activities. Some of these third parties may collect Personal Information over time when you visit the Services or other web sites and services.

## 7\. Data Protection and Incident Response

  
LAFS takes data security very seriously. LAFS takes commercially reasonable technical, physical, and administrative security measures designed to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Such measures vary depending on the sensitivity of the information at issue. 

Please note that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially reasonable means designed to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.  
**  
How will LAFS handle a data breach or security incident?**

By using the Sites or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Sites.

Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. 

LAFS has procedures in place that are designed to stop threats that may expose personally identifiable information, restore Services to full functionality, document and take proactive steps to ensure the incident cannot be repeated. LAFS will also preserve necessary evidence for investigation by security professionals and law enforcement as appropriate. In the unlikely event of an unauthorized disclosure of records, LAFS will follow its Security Incident Response Procedure, which articulates how to report the problem to internal and external stakeholders. The notification process includes any information that can identify which customers and students may have been impacted, the data that may have been accessed, LAFS’s process to inform affected customers, and steps to prevent the incident from happening again as appropriate. 

In the unlikely event of an unauthorized disclosure of Data, LAFS has implemented a process for responding to incidents and notifying affected individuals and, if applicable, law enforcement personnel.

## 16\. Student Information and FERPA

Student Personal Information (Personal Information regarding a student enrolled at LAFS) contained in Educational Records collected or maintained by LAFS are subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA). 

FERPA sets forth requirements regarding the privacy of student records. FERPA governs (1) release of these records (known as education records) maintained by a school or by a third party on behalf of a school and (2) access to these records.

**_What is an Educational Record?_**

Education records are any records directly related to a student and maintained by a school or by a party acting for the school. Education records include demographics, personal information, class assignments, attendance, grades, test scores, placement scores, discipline records, special services, Financial Aid, etc.

**_What is NOT an Educational Record?_**

• Records of instructional, supervisory, administrative, and certain educational personnel which are in the sole possession of the maker thereof, and are not accessible or revealed to any other individual except a substitute.

• Records maintained by a law enforcement unit of an educational agency created by that law enforcement unit for the purpose of law enforcement and not shared with others.

• Records relating to individuals who are employed by the school, which are made and maintained in the normal course of business, related exclusively to individuals in their capacity as employees and not available for any other purpose (Records of individuals in attendance at ARE EDUCATIONAL RECORDS).

• Records relating to a student which are 1) created or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional acting in his or her professional capacity or assisting in a paraprofessional capacity; 2) used solely in connection with the provision of treatment to the student; and 3) not disclosed to anyone other than individuals providing such treatment so long as the records can be personally reviewed by a physician or other appropriate professional of the student’s choice.

• Records of a school which contain only information relating to a person after that person is no longer a student at the school (information gathered about alumni) unless they refer to the period of time when the individual was a student. 

To review the rights that FERPA gives to students with regard to their Educational Records, please review LAFS’s FERPA Policy available in the most current Student Catalog. 

## 17\. Rights for California Residents

Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of personal information during the preceding year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes and the categories of personal information the company shares. 

Alternatively, the law provides that a company that has a privacy policy that provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing personal information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes may instead provide information on how to exercise that choice. LAFS qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive privacy policy that sets forth that Company provides you choice prior to sharing your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you choose to opt-out at the time LAFS offers that choice, LAFS does not share your information with that identified third party for its direct marketing purposes.

If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please send your request via email by clicking here or write to us at the following mailing address:
