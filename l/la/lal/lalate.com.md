**Data Transfer Statement, GDPR**  
This LALATE LLC Data Transfer Statement (“Statement”) sets forth LALATE’s policies and practices concerning the transfer of personal data across borders.

**Applicability**  
This Statement applies to LALATE LLC and its U.S. operating businesses, as identified below (collectively and for this statement only, “LALATE”, “we”, or “us”). This Statement forms a part of each LALATE entity’s privacy policy:  
Operating Entity | Representative Platform | Privacy Policy  
LALATE LLC | LALATE (or LALATE.com) | https://news.lalate.com/privacy

LALATE is based in the United States. We provide services globally using computer systems, servers, and databases located in the U.S. When you use our services from outside of the U.S., your information will therefore be transferred to, stored in, and processed in the U.S. Data is collected, stored, used, and shared as set forth in our privacy policies.

**European Users**  
The European Commission has determined that the transfer of personal information of its residents outside of Europe must be subject to a legal framework that adequately protects it. We transfer personal information of European Economic Area (“EEA”) residents to the U.S. (or elsewhere) based upon the following legal frameworks:  
Legitimate business interests: We could not provide our services or comply with our obligations to you without transferring your personal information to the U.S.  
Consent: We may transfer your personal information when we receive your express, revocable consent.

**GDPR**  
We comply with the European Union’s General Data Protection Law (“GDPR”), which governs the protection of personal data of EU residents. To find out more about GDPR, please visit the European Union’s website, at https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en. EU users have the rights to: opt out of cookies (see our Cookie Policy); access, correct, delete, restrict or object to our use of their personal information; be forgotten; and data portability. We enable exercise of these rights through our products (which we reserve the right to modify). We also fulfil our obligations in response to direct requests. If you require assistance, please contact our Data Protection Officer. We may require additional information from you to fulfill your requests. We may charge a reasonable fee if your request imposes an unreasonable cost on us. We will afford UK-based users with all rights available to EU users, regardless of the UK’s EU member status.

**Controllers and Processors**  
Some laws, including the GDPR, differentiate between controllers and processors of data. A “controller” has a direct relationship with you and exercises control over the use of your data. The third-party vendors that help a controller provide a service are considered “processors” because they process the controller’s customer data at the controller’s request (examples are payment processors and cloud-based hosting providers).

All LALATE entities are controllers of personal information on users who set up an account on LALATE.COM. You do not need to set up an account on LALATE to read LALATE news articles.

**Dispute Resolution**  
We are committed to working with you to obtain a fair resolution of any complaint. We encourage you to begin by contacting our Data Protection Officer. We endeavor to respond to requests promptly. If you believe that we have not been able to address your complaint, you may seek redress through other means. For any questions, inquiries, or complaints, please contact us at Data Protection Officer at the physical address listed in our contact page.
