The Service is an online recruitment service and will require job seekers and recruiters to submit  
various information in order to conduct and optimize the job/candidate search and matching  
process. All information is submitted exclusively on a voluntary basis. Please find below details  
of our member privacy practices.

To fully participate in the Service, we require you to register as a member.

To register, we will ask for contact information (job seekers and recruiters) and information  
on your company (employers). Laimoon.com is the sole owner of information collected on the  
registration pages and we will not disclose this information to anyone outside of the Service.  
Your contact information (such as name and email address may however be used to contact  
you about any features/services on our site which we believe may be of interest). Our goal is to  
provide our users with a personalized experience every time they log onto the Service and to that  
end we may direct you to jobs/articles/forums etc. that we think may assist you in your career  
activities.

**Personal Profiles**

Members build their personal profiles on the Service through entering specific personal data,  
making preference choices, freely answering questions or attaching their CVs.

It is not the Company’s policy to seek any sensitive information through the Service  
unless legally required for recruitment purposes. Sensitive information includes data  
relating to race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or similar beliefs, trade  
union membership, physical or mental health, sexual life, or criminal record. We  
suggest that you do not provide sensitive information of this nature. If you do wish to  
provide sensitive information for any reason, the Company accepts your explicit consent  
to use that information in the ways described in this Privacy Policy or as described at the  
point where you choose to disclose.

In order to present you as a candidate on a vacancy, your personal information will  
be provided to other Service Members who maybe potential recruiters, affiliates, and  
recruitment agents. If you do not wish to participate in this service and benefit from  
the career opportunities that the Service provides, please do not enter your personal  
information into the website.

Information obtained by the site is used only for the intended purposes stated. It is the  
Company's policy not to sell or share your personal information for related or unrelated

purposes to non-licensee third parties, unless otherwise stated at the time of collection.  
If at any time we decide to use personal data in a manner different from that stated  
at the time it was collected, we will endeavor to notify you and give you a choice as  
to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. No notification  
and choice will be sought if the Company is compelled or required by applicable law,  
statute, regulation, ordinance, or court order to disclose personal data.

As an additional privacy function, job seekers have the option to block the name of their current  
employer from their personal profiles. This is an important feature as the last person you would  
like viewing your personal profile is your current employer.

You may edit/change/amend information on personal profile at any point in time. You may also  
remove your CVs from the Service at any point in time.

**Job Postings**

Employers are asked to submit detailed contact information and information about the position  
requirements as part of their job posting activity. Information is submitted purely voluntarily. Job  
details may be viewed by any registered job seeker members. As an additional privacy feature,  
employers may hide their company name when their jobs are viewed online. Your privacy will  
thus be assured while job seekers have the option to apply for the posting.

You may change/modify/delete any information you provide at any point in time.
