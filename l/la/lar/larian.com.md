**Last update: March 20th, 2018**

Larian Studios values your privacy and respects your rights to control your personal data. We aim to be transparent about what data we're collecting and why. We will protect your data like a dragon protects its treasure. We do not sell your data to third parties and we never will. 

The overarching purpose of collecting your data is to improve your gaming experience. Whether we are asking you to tell us who you are and what else you like, logging and analyzing gameplay experiences for different gameplay and game experience purposes, or whether we are offering you customer support when something goes wrong, our goal is for you to enjoy our games as much as possible. 

This statement explains the personal information we collect from and about you, either directly or indirectly, and how we use it. The statement also covers what choices you can make about the data we collect, and how you can control those choices. It applies to all Larian Studios Products.  It additionally applies to any Larian Studios Services, such as Larian Studios owned websites, as well as other offline interactions such as Larian Studios events or Larian Studios booths at conventions. 

Please read this statement carefully to understand when you may provide personal information to us and how Larian Studios uses personal information provided. By using Larian Studios Products and Services you agree to the use of your personal information as described in this statement. The terms "we", "us", or "Larian Studios" are each intended to refer to Larian Studios. 

To make the information in this statement easy to understand it's structured to highlight different points at which a typical customer would potentially share information with Larian Studios. It is broken down into the following four segments: 

  * Learning about Larian Studios 
  * Purchasing Larian Studios Products 
  * Using Larian Studios Products 
  * Getting help from Larian Studios 



Additional sections give more detail about How We Use Personal Information, Sharing and Disclosure, How to Access and Control Your Personal Information, Other Important Privacy Information, and How to Contact Us regarding your information.

**Purchasing Larian Studios Products**

Once you have made the decision to purchase a Larian Studios Product, we sometimes offer ways for customers to purchase directly from us (for instance at larianvault.com or via Kickstarter). When you purchase from us, you may be asked to provide information so that we can complete your purchase. Such information may include things like your name, phone number, email, shipping address, and payment information. 

**We collect:** your name, phone number (optional), email address, shipping address, and payment information. 

**Why:** We use this information to complete your transaction, follow up with you about your purchase, help with the delivery process, handle returns, and other issues related to the purchase of your Larian Studios Products. **Note that we do not store any payment or credit card information. We only use payment information in connection with your purchase of Larian Studios Products.**

**Using Larian Studios Products**

There are three main reasons we collect information from your Larian Studios Products: (1) to offer you support in case something goes wrong, (2) to offer you improvements and updates based on usage, and (3) to make Larian Studios Products better over time. 

Regarding reason number 1: when something goes wrong, you are given the option to send anonymous data to us.

Electing to opt out may make the ads you see on the internet less relevant to you.
