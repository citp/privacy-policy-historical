## Our Pledge to You, Our Customer

La‑Z‑Boy respects your privacy. We do not sell, rent, loan or transfer any personal information regarding our customers to any unrelated third parties. Any information you give us about yourself is held with the utmost care and security and will not be used in ways to which you have not consented. Information collected on our Web site is used by La‑Z‑Boy Incorporated, its subsidiaries, affiliates and authorized agents (referred to collectively as “La‑Z‑Boy”) for La‑Z‑Boy purposes. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. La‑Z‑Boy will not collect any personal information about you except when specifically and knowingly provided by you. Examples of personally identifiable information include full name, home address, e-mail address and phone number. La‑Z‑Boy does automatically collect and analyze certain information from consumers, including the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; browser type, version, and time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and platform; purchase history, the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site, including date and time; cookie number; and products you viewed or searched for. La‑Z‑Boy will use reasonable efforts to include accurate and up-to-date information on this site. All users agree that all access to and use of this site and its content is at your own risk. La‑Z‑Boy will not be liable for any damage arising out of your access to, use of, or inability to use this site, or any errors or omissions in the content thereof. The materials in this site are provided without warranties of any kind, either expressed or implied.

You may choose to provide us with access to certain personal information stored by third parties through social media sites (such as Facebook and Twitter). The information we have access to varies by site and is controlled by your privacy settings on that site and your authorization. By authorizing La‑Z‑Boy to have access to this information, you agree that La‑Z‑Boy may collect, store and use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming any orders placed through our Web site. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.

## Use of Your Information

Authorized La‑Z‑Boy employees internally use information collected on our Web site for four main purposes. First, we collect information to figure out how to improve our site by seeing which areas' features and products are most popular. Second, we collect information to administer our business, provide superior service, and communicate information about our products and services that we believe to be of interest to you. Third, we collect information in order to personalize the site for our customers. For example, in the future, we may recommend products or features you may like based on what you have liked in the past. Last, we collect information to enable customers to participate in sweepstakes, contests and other activities on our Web site. If we collect any such information, we will only collect enough information to enable you to participate in the activity and no more. If we want to collect information for other purposes, we will inform you when we collect the information. Occasionally, La‑Z‑Boy may also share non-personal, summary information regarding our customers with unrelated third parties (for example, we publicly disclose the aggregate number of registered users of our Web site). However, La‑Z‑Boy does not share any personal information about any particular customer with unrelated third parties. (We may do so in the unlikely event that we believe that disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (ii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (iii) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of La‑Z‑Boy, its users or the public). If you do not want to receive e-mail from us and currently do, please reply to an e-mail that we have sent to you and insert "unsubscribe" in the subject line, or click the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any of our emails.

La‑Z‑Boy also uses Adobe's analytics service, which uses cookies and web beacons to help us understand more about how our website is used, so that we can continue to improve it.

We do not knowingly collect or use personal information from children under 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, without verifiable parental consent. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, without first receiving verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.
