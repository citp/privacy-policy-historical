### Layar Privacy Policy

  1. #### GENERAL




At Layar we understand that privacy is an important issue and that personal data should be processed in accordance with the applicable legislation. The information provided in this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") is designed to help you, understand what information we collect, and how we handle the information once we collected it.




If you are an end-user (an "End User") of the Layar websites (the "Layar Websites") or Layar's augmented reality browser (the "Layar Reality Browser") we will collect your data by means of the Layar Websites, through the Layar Reality Browser or through other contacts between you and Layar. If you are a developer (a "Developer") or a publisher (a "Publisher") of third party content and functionalities (the "Content"), we will also collect your data by means of the information, tools, applications, services, products, software, websites and systems (the "Platform") which Layar provides for the purpose of enabling you to create Content as well as the marketing and distribution of the Content, or through other contacts between you and Layar.

    * when you, as an End User, use the Layar Websites or the Layar Reality Browser, we will process your data necessary for your access to and the subsequent transmission of Content. Layar is the controller with regard to these processings. Please be aware that the Content which you can access by means of the Layar Reality Browser, is provided to you by the Publishers. Layar merely provides the underlying infrastructure for your access to the Content. If you choose to disclose your data with Publishers, these Publishers are the controllers with regard to the processing of your personal data in connection with your use of the Content. The Publishers are independently responsible for compliance with applicable data protection legislation with regard to these processings; Layar does not process or store this data; and
    * when you, as a Developer or Publisher, use the Platform, we will process your data necessary for the marketing and distribution of the Content. Layar is the controller with regard to these processings.

Layar only processes those personal data necessary for the fulfilment of the abovementioned purposes. We may collect the following categories of data from you as an End User, namely contact information, device information, profile information, payment information, marketing information, sales information, user generated information, social information and support information. If you are a Developer or a Publisher, we may, in addition to the aforementioned data, also collect content ownership information.




Your personal data will not be sold to third parties.




As part of the services offered to you, the information you provide to us may be transferred to countries within and outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA"). More specifically your personal data may be transferred to hosting parties, email service providers, CRM providers and payment service providers in the United States, having a different level of data protection. However, if we transfer your information outside of the EEA in this way, we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your privacy rights remain protected. The purpose of the transfer is the provision of access to and subsequent transmission of mobile services, including (personalised) augmented reality services.




Specifically to End Users we point out the following:



    * We will also process location data including but not limited to your GPS-location, which we receive from GPS location service providers. These location data shall only be processed for as long as this is necessary for delivering our services or to the extent required or permitted by applicable law.
    * As mentioned above your personal data will not be sold to third parties. However, please note that we will need to disclose personal data such as location data to the Publishers of the Content, since this is necessary to be able to provide you with access to the Content. Furthermore, your personal data may be disclosed to (insert recipient) for the purpose of the delivery of mobile services to you.
    * We may transfer the abovementioned location data to Publishers who may be located in countries outside of the EEA having a different level of data protection for the purpose of providing you with access to the Content. For such transfers we will ask your unambiguous consent.
