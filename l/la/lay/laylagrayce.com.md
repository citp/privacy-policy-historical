You may choose to sign up for our mailing list, but rest assured that we will never share or sell your information with any third parties.

### Security Policy

We have taken every measure to ensure that online shopping at Layla Grayce is as secure as possible. We use Secure Socket Layering (SSL), the industry standard encryption technology that ensures safe internet transmission of your personal information. Once you enter the Checkout process (when you are ready to purchase the items you have put into your shopping cart), your connection to our server becomes secure. To confirm this, look at the bottom part of your browser window. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser) you can be sure that your information is secure. You can also ensure security by checking the URL line of your browser. When you enter the secure area of our site, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." If for some reason you do not see these cues please contact us directly to place your order.
