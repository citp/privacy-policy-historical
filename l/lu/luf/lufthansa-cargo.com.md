# Lufthansa Cargo: Privacy Policy

In addition to being bound by strict German and European legislation concerning data privacy, Lufthansa Cargo wishes to assure you of its strong commitment to the following principles, which in certain aspects go even further than the current legislation. Lufthansa Cargo feels a strong need to observe a balance between offering personalized services to its customers and safeguarding the individual&apos;s right to data privacy. In the event of any questions or problems concerning this Privacy Policy, please contact our chief privacy officer. ****

**Principles  
** Lufthansa Cargo does not collect personally identifiable information through the Internet or otherwise unless you explicitly choose to provide this information. If Lufthansa Cargo collects information, this will only be for clearly specified purposes. 

When you choose to provide us with information, it is kept strictly confidential. We do not sell, share or in any way disclose the information obtained for specific purposes to third parties unless obliged to do so by law and/or legal proceedings (e.g., court orders). 

The data our customers provide us with is discarded as soon as the original purpose (authorization of the user data, support and optimization of ongoing processes) is no longer relevant or the customer informs us that he/she desires the data to be discarded. 

We make every effort to keep data given to us accurate and up to date, and we will process requests for updates quickly and reliably. 

We make sure that our staff are trained to adhere to these standards. Our employees sign a statement of commitment to these principles. 

**Personalized Services  
** In order to optimize and personalize our online services to meet your needs, we employ a technology called cookies for personalized sessions. We assure you that we discard this information as soon as you terminate the session. The information collected to optimize our Internet site (e.g., domain name, pages viewed, number of visits, time spent on our site) is only used to improve the website and its content. The analysis of this data preserves the anonymity of our customers. ****

**Internet Links  
** We are aware that quite a few participating parties in the Internet do not adhere to these principles . We do not accept any responsibility for the behavior and practices of third parties involved. Although we try to make sure that sites we link to adhere to the principles mentioned above, we are not responsible for the content and privacy policy employed by other Internet sites, carriers and ISPs. ****

**Cookies  
** A cookie is a small element of data that can be exchanged between an Internet site and a client&apos;s browser. It can be stored on either side to enable the Internet application to recognize the client on return. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, and you may choose to accept the cookie or not. If you do not accept the cookie the corresponding Internet page cannot be accessed. If you accept the cookie, you can delete it from the file (cookies.txt) or from the directory (e.g.: ..WINNTcookies...) after the session.
