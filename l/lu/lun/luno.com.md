## How we use cookies

We also collect personal data through the use of cookies. Cookies (and other similar technologies) help us give you the best experience of using our site.

Cookies are small data files that we or companies we work with may place on your computer or other devices when you visit our website. They allow us to remember your actions or preferences over time.

We use cookies to collect data that helps us to:

  * track site usage and browsing behaviour;
  * allow you to sign in to your account and navigate through the website;
  * tailor our website’s functionality to you personally by letting us remember your preferences;
  * improve how our website performs;
  * allow third parties to provide services to our website;

  * mitigate risk, enhance security and help prevent fraud.



We use both session and persistent cookies. Session cookies are deleted when you close down your browser, while persistent cookies remain on your device until they expire or you delete them. Persistent cookies allow us to remember things about you when you visit our website again.

## Third-party cookies

We may use authorised third-party providers to help us with various aspects of our business, such as website operations, services, applications, advertising, support tools and to serve you relevant content.

These service providers may place cookies on your device (third-party cookies) or make use of similar tracking technologies such as web beacons. No personally identifiable information is stored in third-party cookies. The information reported to us is aggregated and anonymous. We use this information to understand, for example, the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing. Web beacons are small graphic images (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear GIFs”) which may be used to collect and store information about visits to our website (such as which pages you viewed and how long you spent on the website) and communication efficiency (such as the email delivery and open rates). Where necessary, the information gathered by web beacons may be tied to your personal data strictly for the purposes set out herein.

## Declining cookies

Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.

Certain aspects and features of our services are only available through the use of cookies. By signing up for an account with Luno, or continuing to use our website, you agree to our use of cookies as set out in this policy. You may decline our cookies if your browser or browser add-on permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of Luno's services. For information on how to delete or reject cookies, you can consult the "help" function within your browser, or visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/), where you will also find more information data about cookies generally.

## Security of your personal data

Luno places great importance on ensuring the security of your personal data. We regularly review and implement up-to-date technical and organisational security measures when processing your personal data. Employees of Luno are trained to handle personal data securely and with the utmost respect, failing which they may be subject to disciplinary action.

## Global company

The personal data we collect may be transferred to, stored and processed outside of the jurisdiction in which you reside, and the laws of those countries may differ from the laws applicable in your own country. For example, data collected in the European Economic Area (EEA) may be transferred to, stored and processed at a destination(s) outside of the EEA. Any processing of such data will be undertaken by our staff, or the staff of our third-party service providers, whose roles will include verifying your identity, processing payment details, and providing customer support.

By accepting this Privacy Policy, and then submitting your personal data, you agree to the transfer, storing or processing of it outside of your jurisdiction.

## Additional matters relating to personal data

### Retention of personal data

Luno will retain your personal data, in compliance with this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, for the duration of your relationship with us, and afterwards for such period as may be necessary for our legitimate business purposes (including compliance with our legal obligations, preventing fraud, resolving disputes and enforcing agreements), to protect the interests of Luno and its customers, and as required by law.

### Incomplete personal data

Where indicated (for example in application forms or account opening forms), it is obligatory to provide your personal data to us to enable us to process your application for our products or services. Should you decline to provide such personal data, we may not be able to process your application/request or provide you with our products or services.

### Your right to access, update, or remove your personal data

Most of the data Luno collects, and the ways in which we use it, are necessary for us to provide and improve the services we provide to you, or to comply with our obligations. In certain situations, we give you the ability to choose how we use your data.

Depending on the country in which you live, you may have certain rights under data protection law, including the right to object to the processing of your personal data or to request that we:

  * provide you with a copy of your personal data (including in a format that can be shared with a new provider); or
  * correct, delete, or restrict the processing of your personal data.



Please submit a support ticket if you would like to exercise any of the above rights. These rights are limited in some situations, such as where we are legally required to process your data, and may limit your ability to use our products and services.

### Data breaches

We will notify you and the relevant supervisory authority as soon as we become aware of any data breach that is likely to result in a risk to your rights and freedoms.

### Credit and debit card data

We do not store your full credit and debit card data. This data is securely transferred and stored off-site by an authorised payment vendor in compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). This information is not accessible to Luno or Luno’s employees or any agent acting for or on behalf of Luno.

### Revisions to this Privacy Policy

We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. You should visit the website regularly to check when this Privacy Policy was last updated and to review the current policy. We will do our best to notify you of any substantive amendments to the Privacy Policy and any such notice will be posted on our application or our website, or sent by email to the address associated with your Luno Account (see [Electronic Communications](https://web.archive.org/en/legal/terms#electronic_communication)).
