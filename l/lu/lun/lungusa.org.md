The person or family you designate will receive an acknowledgment card in your name. We collect this prospect information in order to honor your request to send an acknowledgement card. Prospect information is forwarded to the local lung association associated with the prospect, but is not included on any Direct Mail listings for the American Lung Association.

> 
> * _**The "ALA Survey":**_

This survey asks for contact information and user profile information like sex, age, education, internet connection, whether a family member has lung disease, area of lung health interest and occupation. We also ask if the visitor has ever donated online, and if so, how much, and whether the visitor has ever done any volunteering in the past year. These questions help us define the needs of our users.

> * _**Online "Volunteerism" Submissions:**_

> * **_Registering for "Freedom From Smoking® Online:"_**
