Lulu Guinness Holdings Ltd ("LULU GUINNESS", "we", "our", "us") and its subsidiary companies respect the privacy rights of its online visitors ("you", "your", "yours") and recognise the importance of protecting the information collected about them. We have adopted a corporate wide Privacy Policy that guides how we collect, store and use the information that you provide us with. As part of our commitment to your privacy rights and security, our website has been certified by Cybertrust.<br> <br>
If you are under 16, we require that you inform a parent or guardian about Lulu Guinness Ltd’s Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions as well as requiring their consent to the Privacy Policy and <a href="http://www.luluguinness.com/termsandconditions.aspx">Terms and Conditions</a> before registering with www.luluguinness.com or placing an order with www.luluguinness.com.<br> <br>
The following information is provided by Lulu Guinness to enable our online visitors to be fully informed of our Privacy Policies. By visiting <a href="http://www.luluguinness.com/homepage.aspx">www.luluguinness.com</a>, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions.<br> <br>
This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites maintained by other companies or organisations to which we link. Lulu Guinness Ltd is not responsible for any personal information you submit to third parties via our website. Please ensure that you read the Privacy Policy of such other companies or organisations before submitting your details.<br> <br> <strong>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM YOU AND HOW?</strong><br>
Lulu Guinness collects personal information in several ways when you place an order or register for a service offered by Lulu Guinness. If an order is placed with us, we need to hold personal information including your name, email address, phone numbers, home address, shipping and credit card billing address(es) so that we can process and fulfil your order. Card details will never be shared with third parties and will only be used to process your order, using our payment gateway system. Additionally we may also obtain information as a result of authentication or identity checks. We will ask for your telephone number to be given to our courier for delivery services. These details allow us to process your order and to let you know the status of your order.<br> <br> <strong>WHAT ABOUT COOKIES?</strong><br>
Our site uses cookies to keep track of how often you visit our site, the contents of your shopping cart, previous purchases and to deliver content specific to your interests. (A cookie is a piece of information that is stored on your computer's hard drive by your web browser which tracks your movements within websites.) Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies but usually you can alter the settings of your browser to prevent automatic acceptance. If you choose not to receive cookies, you may still use most of the features of our website, including the ability to purchase items. For more information on cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information provided by the Interactive Advertising Bureau at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.<br> <br> <strong>HOW THIS INFORMATION MAY BE USED, INCLUDING ANYONE IT MIGHT BE SHARED WITH?</strong><br>
Lulu Guinness may use your personal information for the processing of orders, payments and to provide you with a personalised shopping experience. We will also use your details to fulfil and deliver your orders and manage your account. Personal Information that you provide may be disclosed to a credit reference or fraud prevention agency, which may keep a record of that information. Your personal information may also be shared with other trading divisions within the Lulu Guinness group. Where there is a legal obligation to do so, we may disclose your information to any relevant regulatory body.<br>
We may also use your personal information to send you marketing updates but only ever in accordance with your preferences (as detailed in the next section). We never sell your details to third party marketing companies.<br>
We do collate statistical information about site traffic, sales and other commercial information which we may pass on to trusted third parties but these statistics do not include any information which can identify you personally. We see this as a value-added service helping you to find useful products or services.<br>
Finally, we may use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, together with non-personal data to monitor customer patterns so we can consistently improve our site design to better meet our visitors' needs.<br>
From time to time Lulu Guinness may employ third party business partners to collect personal information on Lulu Guinness's behalf. In such cases, these third parties will be subject to confidentiality agreements and instructed by Lulu Guinness to comply fully with the Lulu Guinness Privacy Policy.<br> <br> <strong>MARKETING OPT-IN AND OPT-OUT PROVISION</strong><br>

Such alerts may include marketing information about Lulu Guinness, our subsidiaries or selected business partners.<br>
At all times, we will offer you the opportunity to unsubscribe out of any service or update to which you have subscribed, if you change your mind.

We will use our best endeavours to maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information you have provided us with. When you place an order or access your account information, we use a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption which encrypts your information before it is sent to us to protect it from unauthorised use.
