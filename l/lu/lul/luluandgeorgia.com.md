# Privacy Policy

## We value your privacy

Lulu & Georgia is committed to keeping your personal and confidential information just that – personal and confidential. Your personal information is only required when you place an order, fill out a wishlist, or create a customer account. We use the information you provide to process and ship orders, and to contact you if necessary. You can sign up for our mailing list without having to worry that we're selling your personal information to any third parties; rest assured, we're not.

## Security Policy

We have taken every precaution to ensure that online shopping at Lulu & Georgia is as secure as possible. We use Secure Socket Layering (SSL), the industry standard encryption technology that ensures safe internet transmission of your personal information. When you place items in our shopping cart and purchase those items, your connection to our server becomes secure. To confirm this, look at the bottom part of your browser window. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), you can be sure that your information is secure. You can also ensure security by checking the URL line of your browser. When you enter the secure area of our site, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." If for some reason you do not see these cues please contact us directly to place your order.
