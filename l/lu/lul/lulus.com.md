We do not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us. "Personally identifiable information" includes individually identifiable information about an individual consumer collected online by us from the individual, including any of the following: (1) a first and last name; (2) a physical address, including without limitation a street name and name of a city or town; (3) an e-mail address; (4) a telephone or fax number; or (5) any other identifier that permits the physical or online contacting of a specific individual. The types of personally identifiable information that we may request include your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number. We may store your personally identifiable information alongside non-personally identifiable information about you.

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not submit personally identifiable information to us or use the Website.

We may collect non-personally identifiable information about you in a number of ways, including tracking your Internet activities through your IP address, computer settings or most-recently visited URL. We may also ask you to directly provide certain non-personally identifiable information about yourself, such as your clothing preferences.

When you use the Website we might insert some instructions on your computer or mobile device. These instructions will be in the form of a "cookie" or similar file. Cookies are small pieces of instruction stored on your hard drive or device, not on our Website. Cookies provide us with information that we use to enhance your experience on the Website. Right now, there are two basic types of cookies. One is a session cookie which terminates when the user's session ends. The second is a persistent cookie, which is a text file that stays stored on your computer for a period of time. Your Internet browser contains instructions about how to remove persistent cookies. If you reject all cookies, you may not be able to create or sign in to your account with us or otherwise take full advantage of our Site.

We use cookies to collect information, on an aggregate basis, about how the Website is used. This information may include the date and time of visits to the Website and time spent on the Website. We also use cookies to learn more about our audience size and usage patterns, to store information about your preferences so as to allow us to customize our Website according to your interests and provide a more personalized experience, to speed up searches or to recognize you when you return to our Website, to identify the pages viewed or searched for, page response times, download errors, length of visits, page interaction information (such as click, scrolling, etc.) or methods used to browse away from a page, but none of our cookies is intended to identify you personally. You can obtain more information about cookies at

We may also use web beacons. A web beacon is an invisible graphic on a web page or email that is programmed to collect non-personally identifiable information about the use of a given website or newsletter, such as whether or not an email is opened and viewed. 

_**"Do Not Track"**_

Some browsers have a "do not track" feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. At this time, we do not respond to browser "do not track" signals. 

_**How We Use Your Information**_

We typically use your information to deliver products to you and to improve the design and performance of the Website. We may use your information to deliver to you, among other things, communications, emails, newsletters and marketing materials from us. Your information may also be used to contact you when necessary.

Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not provide access to your personally identifiable information to third parties for any unauthorized purpose.

By using the service, you do consent to us providing your information to third parties that assist us in the operation and delivery of our Website, products and services. We will take reasonable steps to require any such third parties to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

Your information will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy even if we undergo a business transition. However, we may transfer your information to a successor person or entity upon an acquisition or other corporate reorganization. You hereby consent to such transfers, and we may assign and transfer all of the rights, benefits, duties, and obligations of this Privacy Policy.

We may disclose your information if, among other things, we have a good faith belief that we are required to do so by law or if acting with a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with legal process; (2) enforce this Policy or the Terms; (3) respond to legal claims; (4) respond to your requests for customer services or transaction completion; or (5) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Lulus, the Website's users or the public.

If you do not want us to share or disclose your information as stated herein, please do not use the Website or submit personally identifiable information.

_**Your California Privacy Rights**_

Lulus sends 3-4 promotional emails per week to keep our subscribers informed about the latest trends and sales at Lulus.com. It is possible to unsubscribe at any time by simply clicking the link at the bottom of an email. Having trouble? Send an email to postmaster@lulus.com with the subject line "unsubscribe". If you are unsubscribed, any emails you receive from Lulus.com will be directly related to your orders. 

_**Security and Storage**_

We primarily store your information in the United States. Some information may be stored elsewhere. You authorize us to do so.

We take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard and deter unauthorized access to your information. When we collect or transmit sensitive information such as a credit or debit card number, we use industry standard methods to protect that information. Although we take reasonable measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of your information, no e-commerce platform, website, electronic database or system is completely secure. 

_**Third Party Websites**_

The Website contains links to other websites. Other websites we link to include "social media" sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such services. When you submit information or data to third parties, their privacy policies, not ours, will govern their use of the information and data. You should review the privacy policies and terms of service of all such third parties. We do not make any representations regarding the policies or practices of such third parties.

_**Accessing or Updating Your Information**_

We allow you to access and change or modify your information as previously provided. You may do so by contacting us at love@lulus.com. To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making changes or modifications. Unfortunately, we cannot always ensure that such changes or modifications will be reflected in all iterations of your information as previously stored.

Please remember that any information that you disclose on public portions of the Website, such as "comments" forums, may become widespread. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personally identifiable information.
