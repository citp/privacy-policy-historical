We do not link the information from our analytics services to any personal information that you submit to us.

 **OUR LEGAL BASES FOR COLLECTING AND PROCESSING YOUR INFORMATION**

When you access or use our website, we collect, use, and otherwise process your personal information as described in this policy. We rely on a number of legal bases to use your information:

  * As necessary to perform a contract with you or to take steps in preparation for a contract with you, including enabling you to make a purchase from us;
  * Because you have consented to the processing, such as for receiving marketing messages or third-party data sharing related to advertising;
  * As necessary to comply with a legal obligation, a court order, or to exercise or defend legal claims;
  * As necessary for the purposes of our or a third party’s legitimate interests;
  * As necessary to protect your vital interests, or those of others.



Here are some of our legitimate interests for collecting and processing your personal information:

Detecting and preventing fraud: We have a legitimate interest in detecting and preventing fraud. To do so, it is necessary that we collect and retain information about each transaction made at Lulus. Our auditors require that we keep this information so they can verify that all transactions recorded by Lulus were made by real customers. The credit card companies we work with require this information in the event that fraudulent charges are made using your credit card.

Providing access to and improving Lulus.com: We may use your information to improve and customize our website, including sharing of your information for such purposes, and this is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests of improving our website and our products. This is also necessary to enable us to pursue our legitimate interest in understanding how our website is being used, and to develop and expand our customer base. It is also necessary to allow us to pursue our legitimate interest in improving our website’s functionality and in obtaining insights into what our customers and potential customers want.

Providing access to and improving our customer service: We may use your information to provide you with customer service, and also to improve the service we provide to all customers. This is necessary for us to pursue our legitimate interest in providing great customer service.

Improving our product offerings: We may use your information to improve the products offered at Lulus, and to inform our buying team so they can provide you and our other customers with a great selection of products. This is necessary for us to pursue our legitimate interest in being your destination for affordable luxury.

Keeping our website and your data secure: We have a legitimate interest in ensuring the security of our website, including enhancing protection of our company and our customers against spam, harassment, intellectual property infringement, crime, and security risks of all kind.

 _ **Information We Share**_

Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not provide access to your personal information to third parties for any unauthorized purpose. We never sell or share your contact information to other companies for their direct marketing purposes.

Lulus works closely with third-party businesses (our “vendors”) for a variety of purposes, including assisting us to perform and improve the Lulus website, to deliver your orders, and to provide advertising and email services. These vendors include payment processors, research companies, and analytics and security providers. These third parties have only limited access to your information, and may use your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf. We take reasonable steps to require that any such vendor complies with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

It is necessary for us to share your information with some of our vendors in order to complete our contract with you; for example, to allow them to process payments and shipments and to help us keep our website secure. Other vendors help us improve our website and our products; for example, by helping us conduct research into how we could better serve our customers, or reach new customers. We have a legitimate interest in working with these vendors to improve our business. We rely on your consent (which can be withdrawn at any time) to send marketing messages and for third-party sharing relating to advertising.

Lulus also may share demographic information about our website visitors with vendors, but it will be aggregated and de-personalized, so personal information is not revealed.

Your information will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy even if we undergo a business transition. However, we may transfer your information to a successor person or entity upon an acquisition or other corporate reorganization. You hereby consent to such transfers, and agree that we may assign and transfer all of the rights, benefits, duties, and obligations of this Privacy Policy to a successor person or entity.

We may also disclose your information if we have a good faith belief that we are required to do so by law or if acting with a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with legal process; (2) enforce this Policy or the Terms; (3) respond to legal claims; (4) respond to your requests for customer service or transaction completion; or (5) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Lulus, the website’s users or the public. In these cases, our use of your information may be necessary for the purposes of our or a third party’s legitimate interest in keeping our website secure, preventing harm or crime, enforcing or defending legal rights, or preventing damage. Such use may also be necessary to comply with a legal obligation, a court order, or to exercise or defend legal claims. It may also be necessary in the public interest (such as to prevent crime).

 _ **Consent, Control, Retention**_

Much of your information is stored in your Lulus account profile. You may change or correct the information in your account profile by clicking [here](https://web.archive.org/mydata) or emailing [privacy@lulus.com](mailto:privacy@lulus.com). Only your first and last name and email address are required to have an account with Lulus. If you would like to cancel your account entirely, please email [privacy@lulus.com](mailto:privacy@lulus.com).

Depending on your location, such as the EEA or Canada, you may also have certain additional rights with respect to your information, such as: 

  1. a)data access and portability (including the right to obtain a copy of your personal data, some of which is available through your account profile);
  2. b) data correction (including the ability to update your personal data, much of which you can change directly using your account settings);
  3. c) data deletion (including the right to have Lulus delete your personal information, except information we are required by law to retain);
  4. d) withdrawal of consent (when we rely on your consent to process your information, such as for our marketing emails); and
  5. e) objection to processing (when our processing is based on legitimate interests; this includes, in limited circumstances, the right to ask Lulus to stop processing your personal data). 



If you are located in the EEA or Canada and would like a copy of your data, to have your data corrected, to have your data deleted, to withdraw consent to our further processing your information, or to object to our processing based on legitimate interests, please email [privacy@lulus.com](mailto:privacy@lulus.com) with your request and your country of residence.

Unless you are located in the EEA or Canada and have exercised one of your rights listed above, Lulus will retain your information for as long as is necessary for our legitimate business purposes. Lulus will always retain data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal and financial obligations (for example, to satisfy our auditors, to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws, to enforce our agreements, and as otherwise described in this policy).

Without prejudice to any other rights you may have, if you are located in the EEA or Canada, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection regulator.

 _ **Cookies and Advertising**_

When you visit Lulus.com we insert some instructions on your computer or mobile device. These instructions will be in the form of a “cookie” or similar file. Cookies are small pieces of instruction stored on your hard drive or device, not on our website. Cookies provide us with information that we use to enhance your experience on Lulus.com. Right now, there are two basic types of cookies. One is a session cookie which terminates when the user’s session ends. The second is a persistent cookie, which is a text file that remains stored on your computer for a period of time. Your Internet browser contains instructions about how to remove persistent cookies. If you reject all cookies, you may not be able to create or sign in to your account with us or otherwise take full advantage of the Lulus.com website.

We use cookies to collect information, on an aggregate basis, about how Lulus.com is used. This information includes the date and time of visits to Lulus.com and time spent on our website. We also use cookies to learn more about our audience size and usage patterns, to store information about your preferences to allow us to customize our website according to your interests and to provide a more personalized experience, to speed up searches or to recognize you when you return to our website, to identify the pages viewed or searched for, page response times, download errors, length of visits, page interaction information (such as click, scrolling, etc.) or methods used to browse away from a page, but none of our cookies is intended to identify you personally. You can obtain more information about cookies at <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>.

We may also use web beacons. A web beacon is an invisible graphic on a web page or email that is programmed to collect non-personally identifiable information about the use of a given website or newsletter, such as whether or not an email is opened and viewed.

We partner with third parties to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partners may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you with advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. These technologies allow a site to recognize your computer or mobile device each time you use Lulus.com. We rely on your consent to drop and read non-technically necessary cookies.

Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. At this time, we do not respond to browser “do not track” signals.

 **HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION**

We take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard and deter unauthorized access to your information. Lulus complies with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). This means that when we collect or transmit sensitive information such as a credit or debit card number, we use industry standard methods to protect that information.

Although we take reasonable measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of your information, no e-commerce platform, website, electronic database or system is completely secure. 

**WHERE WE ARE LOCATED**

Lulus is located in the United States, and we primarily store your information in the United States. By using our website and/or providing us with information, you are agreeing to transfer and store your data in the United States.

To our international customers: the privacy laws and standards in the United States, including the level of protection applied to your data and the rights of authorities to access your personal information, may differ from those that apply in the country in which you reside. The European Commission has not made a determination that the United States adequately provides safeguards for the transfer of data, and at this time Lulus has not put in place the exact safeguards set forth in GDPR Article 46. The transfer of your data to the United States is necessary for the performance of our contract with you (so we can process your order) and/or to take pre-contractual measures at your request (i.e. to set up your Lulus account).

At times, we may transfer your personal information outside of the United States, in which case we take reasonable steps to make sure your personal information continues to be appropriately protected. However, no data transfer system is completely secure.

 _ **Third Party Websites**_

Lulus.com contains links to other websites. Other websites we link to include social platforms. We also use third-party plug-ins in certain places on our website. For example, when you click on an icon on the Lulus website to share our products on a third party social platform, you are also loading content from that third-party site. That site may request cookies directly from your browser. These interactions are subject to the privacy policy and terms of service of the third-party site, not ours. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such services. We do not make any representations regarding the policies or practices of third parties. When you use third-party sites or services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those sites or services. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of third parties before disclosing personal information to them. For the purposes of E.U. law, these third parties are independent controllers of data.

 _ **Your California Privacy Rights**_

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of Lulus who are California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of personally identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. However, at this time we do not share any of your personally identifiable information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
