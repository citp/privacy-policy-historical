								<p>Lutron Electronics, Inc. respects the privacy of our website visitors. Please 
									review the following document that explains how we continue to maintain the 
									highest level of integrity while continuing to offer world-class products and 
									services to our customers.</p>
								<p>Lutron's Commitment to Privacy</p>
								<p>This policy is designed to aid you in recognizing how we collect, use and 
									safeguard any personal information that you voluntarily provide to us. This 
									statement will be continuously assessed against new technologies and business 
									practices as well as our customers' needs.</p>
								<p>What Information Does Lutron Collect?</p>
								<p>When you visit www.lutron.com you may provide us with two types of information: 
									web site use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and other 
									people browse our web site, and personal information you knowingly and 
									voluntarily choose to disclose to Lutron that we collect on an individual 
									basis.</p>
								<p>How Does Lutron Collect Web Site Use Information?</p>
								<p>Similar to other web sites, www.lutron.com utilizes a standard technology called 
									cookies (see below) and web server logs to accumulate information about traffic 
									on our web site (such as the time spent at our web site, the pages viewed, the 
									date and time of visits, the web sites visited just before and just after our 
									web site, etc.). This information is only collected on an aggregate basis and 
									is NOT associated with you as an individual.</p>
								<p>What Are Cookies?</p>
								<p>Cookies are a standard feature of web browser software that allows web servers 
									to recognize the computer used to access a web site. Cookies are small pieces 
									of data that are stored by a user's web browser on the visitor's hard drive. 
									Cookies can remember what information a visitor accesses on one web page to 
									simplify subsequent interactions with that web site by the same visitor or to 
									use the information to streamline the visitor's transactions on related web 
									pages. This makes it easier for a visitor to move from web page to web page and 
									to complete commercial transactions over the Internet.</p>
								<p>How Does Lutron Use Information Collected from Cookies?</p>
								<p>We use tools such as cookies and web server logs to gather information about 
									customers' browsing activities in order to constantly improve our web site and 
									better serve our customers. This information assists us to design and arrange 
									our web pages in a user-friendly manner and to continually improve our web site 
									to better meet the needs of our current and prospective customers.</p>
								<p>Cookies also help us collect important business and technical statistics. The 
									information in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by visitors to our 
									web site as they move from one page to another. Web server logs allow us to 
									count how many people visit our web site and evaluate our web site's visitor 
									capacity and speed of response. Lutron does not use these technologies to 
									capture your individual email address or any personally identifying information 
									about you.</p>
								<p>Will I Get A Banner Ad or Other Targeted Advertisement Sent To Me?</p>
								<p>Anytime you visit a website and have "cookies" enabled, you provide enough 
									information for the hosting company to allow other companies to send you 
									"banner ads" or other forms of advertisements. This is in spite of the fact 
									that the advertising companies will not be able to associate a specific name of 
									a viewer with a corresponding email address.</p>
								<p>Lutron does not participate in any revenue-sharing programs with any banner 
									advertising companies, so you will never receive a banner ad as a result of a 
									visit to www.lutron.com .</p>
								<p>Notice of New Services and Changes</p>
								<p>Once in a while we may notify you via email about important changes to our web 
									site, new products and services, or special offers that we believe you will 
									find valuable.&nbsp;You will always be given an opportunity to remove your 
									email address from this list at the end of each electronic communication. 
									Finally, we will not attempt to ever contact you via phone unless you have 
									specifically given us permission to do.</p>
								<p>How Does Lutron Ensure the Security of Credit Card Transactions?</p>
								<p>
									Customers can not purchase products directly from Lutron through our website.</p>
								<p>
									Lutron provides links to Lutron accounts that offer their own hosted online 
									store where you can purchase (via credit card) a limited number of Lutron 
									products. Each one of these companies has their own policy on transaction 
									security and handling of private information. You should understand how each 
									company uses the information they collect and how they maintain the security of 
									their site and credit card transactions BEFORE electing to do business with any 
									company. Note that while Lutron will only provide initial links to web sites 
									offering Lutron products for sale that we believe are using secure transmission 
									technologies, we DO NOT continuously monitor these sites and as such can make 
									no representations about the current security of these sites.</p>
								<p>Other email that you may send to us may not be secure unless we advise you that 
									security measures will be in place prior to your transmitting the information. 
									For that reason, please do not send confidential information such as Social 
									Security or account numbers to us through an unsecured email.</p>
								<p>What If Lutron Is Legally Compelled to Disclose Information?</p>
								<p>We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, 
									when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection 
									of our legal rights or our customer's legal rights.</p>
								<p>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</p>
								<p>We do not monitor the content, information, or web practices of any of web sites 
									linked to or from our web site, and as such cannot be held responsible for said 
									content, information, or web practices. In particular, while Lutron will only 
									provide initial links to web sites offering Lutron products for sale that we 
									believe are using secure transmission technologies, we DO NOT continuously 
									monitor these sites and as such can make no representations about the current 
									security of these sites.</p>
								<p>What Information Does Lutron Retain?</p>
								<p>In addition to retaining aggregate visitor information and personal information 
									you voluntarily have provided to us, if you choose to correspond further with 
									us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together 
									with your email address and our responses. We provide the same protections for 
									these electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of 
									information received by mail and telephone.</p>
								<p>Who Do I Contact If I Have Any Further Questions Regarding Privacy and/or 
									Security?</p>
