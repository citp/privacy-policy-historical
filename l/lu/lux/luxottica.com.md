6\. Transfer and sharing information

6.1 Sharing with other companies of the Group and with third parties

Other than the persons and entities listed under section 1.1 above, Luxottica may share some personal information acquired directly and indirectly from users, both within the Luxottica group for management of intra-group services as well as with third parties (public bodies, , insurance companies) for the purpose of carrying out activities targeted towards supplying the service regulated by this Privacy Policy, including dispatching the products, managing any claim, analysing data, supplying marketing assistance. Any third parties will be required to process such information in compliance with the applicable regulations, also as data controller.

In addition, a user’s information may be shared with third parties for the following reasons:

  * to permit a merger, acquisition or sale of all or part of our company assets;
  * in response to proceedings;
  * to comply with the requirements of the laws in force, to protect the safety of an individual, to protect the rights and the property of Luxottica, including the need to have the Terms and Conditions of Use observed, and to hinder deceptions or security or technical problems;
  * to inform business partners on the use of the website and on the purchase of products available through it, as grouped statistics or, however, in a format that would not disclose the identity of a user.



The use of data by third party that are not part of Luxottica group is not regulated by this Privacy Policy.

**6.1.1 Social media plug-ins**

This Website uses social media plug-ins furnished by the most important social networks (e.g. facebook.com and twitter.com). When visiting the webpage the browsing data may be transferred directly to the social networks concerned, even without a user’s direct interaction. The user acknowledges and agrees that the operation of social networks' plug-ins is managed directly by the company that manages the corresponding plug-in. When the users use the plug-ins available through the Website (e.g. log in with their access credentials to a social network, or link their Luxottica account to their account on a social network, click on the Facebook “Like” or “Share” button), the User’s browser establishes a direct connection with the server of that social network, which sends the contents of the plug-in directly to the user’s browser.   
Luxottica may therefore receive data relating to the user, in accordance with the social network’s terms of use and privacy policy and may add this information to the user’s data already collected through its own services. If the user opts to share information with the social networks, Luxottica will share the data with them in accordance with the user’s preferences. Any information communicated to the social network will be subject to the privacy policy and the terms and conditions of that social network.   
To prevent those social network from collecting the personal information of the user, please check the relevant conditions on the social network website.

6.2 Data transfer outside the EU 

Luxottica may transfer the data acquired through this Website to companies of the Luxottica group or third parties located in other countries, even those outside of the European Union, to allow the activities listed in this Privacy Policy to be carried out (e.g. hosting services). If the personal information will be transferred to countries that do not provide the same level of protection, or in any case an adequate level of protection (e.g. the United States of America), of personal information, we ensure that each service provider enters into specific contractual obligations according to the applicable data protection legislations (including the execution of the Standard Contractual Clauses as approved by the European Commission) unless we can rely on any other legal basis for transferring personal information. 

7\. Security and protection of information

Luxottica undertakes to protect users’ information. Luxottica advises that the password is one of the protection mechanisms of the account, therefore users are invited to use a password sufficiently secure and stored in a safe place, limiting access to it on their own computers and browsers, disconnecting it after having visited the site. Luxottica also monitors the activity of the Website to avoid non-authorised circulation of personal information. Furthermore, a secure system for identifying fraudulent activities is used. Luxottica uses the standard SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to protect the confidentiality of your personal information.  
Luxottica undertakes to protect the information received from users. All personal information supplied is kept on secure servers and within its internal systems. Luxottica uses adequate safety measures to protect information from non-authorised access or non-authorised changes, and from the circulation or distribution of data. To prevent non-authorised access, to maintain the accuracy of the data and guarantee the proper use of information, Luxottica uses adequate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and protect the information and data stored in our system.   
Although no computer system is completely secure, Luxottica believes that the measures it has implemented reduce the possibility of security problems to an appropriate level for the type of data involved.
