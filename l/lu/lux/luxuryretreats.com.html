            <h5 class="PrivacyTerms__lastupdated">Last updated: April 16 2018</h5>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, process, and disclose your information across the LR Platform. The “<b>LR Platform</b>” refers to Luxury Retreats’ (“<b>LR</b>”) websites, our mobile, tablet and other smart applications, and all associated LR services.</p>
            <p>When this policy mentions “LR,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” it refers to the Luxury Retreats company that is responsible for your information under this Privacy Policy (the “<b>Data Controller</b>”). The Data Controller is the Luxury Retreats entity that you are contracting with which, if you are booking or supplying Accommodation through the LR Platform, will be one of the following:</p>
            <p>
                </p><ol>
                    <li>If you are booking or supplying Accommodation located in Canada or Barbados, the Data Controller is Luxury Retreats International ULC (“<b>LRI</b>”).</li>
                    <li>If you are booking or supplying Accommodation located in the Collectivity of Saint Martin, the Data Controller is SVV SXM (“<b>Carimo</b>”).</li>
                    <li>If you are booking or supplying Accommodation located outside of Canada, Barbados, and Saint Martin, the Data Controller is Luxury Retreats Management Inc. (“<b>LRM</b>”).</li>
                </ol>
            <p></p>
            <p>Please see Section 10 for contact details of the companies listed above.</p>
            <p>In this policy, we use a few terms which are defined as follows: A “<b>Member</b>” is anyone who has registered an LR account, including Suppliers and Guests. A “<b>Supplier</b>” is someone who offers services (“<b>Supplier Services</b>”) via published listings on the LR Platform (“<b>Listings</b>”). A “<b>Guest</b>” is someone who books, or seeks to book, Supplier Services. “<b>Accommodation</b>” means a vacation or other property. “<b>Payment Services</b>” means any payment processing services provided through or in connection with a Member’s use of the LR Platform.</p>

            <p></p><h3>1. Information We Collect</h3><p></p>
            <p>
                There are three general categories of information that we collect.
            </p>
            <p></p><h4>1.1. Information You Give Us.</h4><p></p>
            <p>
                We collect information you share with us when you use the LR Platform in order to ensure the adequate performance of contracts between you and LR, or between you and a Supplier. The provision of this information is necessary to use the LR Platform and, without it, we will not be able to provide you with services that you request.
            </p>
            <p>
                </p><ol>
                    <li><b>Account Information.</b> When you sign up for an LR account or submit a request for Accommodation booking information, we require certain information such as your name and email address.</li>
                    <li><b>Profile Information.</b> To use certain features within the LR Platform, we may need to ask you to complete a profile, which may include your address and phone number.</li>
                    <li><b>Other Authentication-Related Information.</b> To help create and maintain a trusted environment, and to the extent permitted by applicable laws, we may collect identification that you provide (like a photo of your government-issued ID) or other authentication information.</li>
                    <li><b>Payment Information.</b> When you use the Payment Services (such as when booking Accommodation or a travel-related experience through us or establishing a Supplier relationship via us), we require certain financial information (like your bank account or credit card information) to process payments and comply with applicable law. If you are a Supplier, we may require additional information such as your ID or tax ID (where permitted by applicable law), and other proof of identification or verification in order to verify your identity, provide the Payment Services to you, and comply with applicable law. If you are a Guest, we may retain your financial information to assist you with booking travel-related experiences with third parties.</li>
                    <li><b>Communications with LR.</b> When you communicate with LR, we collect information about your communication and any information you choose to provide.</li>
                    <li><b>Other Information.</b> You may otherwise choose to provide us information (such as your itinerary, food allergies, emergency contact information, travel preferences, and information about other guests accompanying you on your stay) when you fill in a form, speak to, or otherwise communicate with an LR representative, conduct a search, update or add information to your LR account, respond to surveys, participate in promotions, or use other features of the LR Platform.</li>
                </ol>
            <p></p>
            <p></p><h4>1.2. Information We Automatically Collect from Your Use of the LR Platform.</h4><p></p>
            <p>
                When you use the LR Platform, we collect information about the services you use and how you use them, even if you don’t sign up for an LR account. We process this information for the activities and legal bases described in Section 2 below.
            </p>
            <p>
                </p><ol>
                    <li><b>Usage Information.</b> We collect information about your interactions with the LR Platform, such as the pages or other content you view, your searches for villas, bookings you have made, the experiences and activities you book with others through us, and other actions on the LR Platform.</li>
                    <li><b>Location Information.</b> When you use certain features of the LR Platform, we may collect different types of information about your general location (e.g. IP address, zip code).</li>

            <p>
                We may collect information that others provide about you when they use the LR Platform, or obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through the LR Platform. LR does not control, supervise or respond for how the third parties providing your information process your personal data, and any information request regarding the disclosure of your personal information to LR should be directed to such third parties.

                </p><ol>
                    <li><b>Third Party Services.</b> If you link, connect, or login to your LR account with a third party service (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Google), we may collect information from the third party service, such as your registration and profile information. This information varies and is controlled by that service or as authorized by you via your privacy settings at that service.</li>
                    <li><b>Background Information.</b> For certain Members in the United States, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, LR may obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or sex offender registrations. For Members outside of the United States, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, LR may obtain the local version of background or registered sex offender checks. We may use your information, including your full name and date of birth, to obtain such reports. We will only collect this information where required by applicable laws or where necessary to ensure the adequate performance of our services for you.</li>
                    <li><b>Other Sources.</b> To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may receive additional information about you, such as demographic data or fraud detection information, from third party service providers and/or partners (such as SafelyStay) and combine it with information we have about you. For example, we may receive background check results or fraud warnings from service providers like identity verification services for our fraud prevention and risk assessment efforts. We may receive information about you and your activities on and off the LR Platform, including about your interactions from our partner ad networks. For example, if you book a restaurant reservation through LR, the restaurant may send information to us that you submitted to them, like your dining preferences or dining activity.  We may receive information about you and your activities on and off the LR Platform through partnerships, or about your experiences and interactions from our partner ad networks.</li>

            <p></p><h4>3.1. With Your Consent or Where Authorized by Law.</h4><p></p>
            <p>
                </p><ol>
                    <li>We may share your information at your direction or as described by us to you at the time of sharing, such as if you, as a Guest, have requested us to connect you with a third party vendor or to purchase services from a third party vendor on your behalf, in connection with your booking (e.g., an insurance provider or activities provider), or if you, as a Supplier, have agreed to let us market your Accommodation through, or refer you to, a third party’s platform. In these situations, you are authorizing LR to disclose to these third party vendors information required to book them and to receive the relevant services from them. This could include special preferences or requests, and any additional guest information. These third party vendors are not controlled by LR and personal information shared with them is subject to their privacy policies and practices.</li>
                    <li>We may also share certain contact details about you, such as your name, email and past reservations in LR, to other companies and business partners of LR, including our affiliate, Airbnb, who may then send you marketing communications about products or services that may interest you.</li>
                </ol>
            <p></p>

            <p>

                    3.2. Sharing between Suppliers and Guests.
                </h4>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                </p><ol>
                    <li>When you as a Guest submit a booking request, certain information about you may be shared with the Supplier to coordinate the booking, such as your name, contact details, and arrival date.</li>
                    <li>When you as a Supplier have a confirmed booking, certain of information about you may be shared with the Guest to coordinate the booking, such as your full name, phone number, and Accommodation address.</li>
                </ol>
            <p></p>
            <p>Sharing this information is necessary to provide Guests with our services, and we don’t share your billing and payout information with other Members.</p>
            <p></p><h4>3.3. Reviews, Listings, and other Public Information.</h4><p></p>
            <p>The LR Platform publishes information that is visible to the general public. For example:</p>
            <p>
                </p><ol>
                    <li>Public Listing pages are publicly visible and include information such as the Accommodation’s approximate or exact location, Listing description, calendar availability, and any additional information the Supplier chooses to share.</li>
                    <li>After completing a booking, Guests may write reviews which may appear publicly on Listing pages (and other pages on which we may market Accommodations) under their first name, last initial, and general location.</li>
                    <li>If you submit content on our blog, in a public forum, or in a social media post, or use a similar feature on the LR Platform, that content is publicly visible.</li>
                </ol>
            <p></p>
            <p>Information you share publicly on the LR Platform may be indexed through third party search engines. If you change your settings or your public-facing content, these search engines may not update their databases. We do not control the practices of third party search engines, and they may use caches containing your outdated information.</p>
            <p></p><h4>3.4. Service Providers.</h4><p></p>
            <p>
                We use a variety of third party service providers to help us provide services related to the LR Platform and ensure we can adequately provide you with our services. For example, service providers may help us: (i) verify or authenticate your identification, (ii) check information against public databases, (iii) assist us with background checks, fraud prevention, and risk assessment, or (iv) provide customer service, advertising, or payments services. These providers have limited access to your information to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are contractually obligated to use it consistent with this policy.
            </p>
            <p></p><h4>3.5. Additional Services by Suppliers.</h4><p></p>
            <p>
                Suppliers may use third party services available through the LR Platform to assist with managing their Accommodation or providing additional services, such as cleaning services, insurance or activities providers. Suppliers may use features on the LR Platform to share information about the Guest (like the Guest’s check-in and check-out dates, name, phone number, and anonymized email address) with that third party service provider for the purposes of coordinating the stay, managing the Accommodation, or delivering other services.
            </p>
            <p></p><h4>3.6. Safety and Compliance with Law.</h4><p></p>
            <p>
                LR may disclose your information to courts, law enforcement or governmental authorities, or authorized third parties, if and to the extent we are required or permitted to do so by law or if such disclosure is reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with legal process and to respond to claims asserted against LR, (ii) to respond to verified requests relating to a criminal investigation or alleged or suspected illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other of our users to legal liability, (iii) to enforce and administer our Terms of Use or other agreements with Members, (iv) for fraud investigation and prevention, risk assessment, customer support, product development and debugging purposes, or (v) to protect the rights, property or personal safety of LR, its employees, its Members, or members of the public.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will attempt to notify Members about these requests unless: (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law, or (ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon LR’s property, its Members and the LR Platform (collectively, “Risk Scenarios”). In instances where we comply with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that Member about the request after the fact if we determine in good faith that we are no longer legally prohibited from doing so and that no <b>Risk Scenarios</b> apply.
            </p>
            <p></p><h4>3.7. Corporate Affiliates.</h4><p></p>
            <p>
                To help us provide the LR Platform, we may share your information within our corporate family of companies (both financial and non-financial entities) that are related by common ownership or control. Additionally, we share your information with our affiliates to support, integrate, promote, and improve the LR Platform and our affiliates’ services. Our affiliates include other Luxury Retreats companies and <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> companies.
            </p>
            <p></p><h4>3.8. Widgets.</h4><p></p>
            <p>
                We may display parts of the LR Platform (e.g., your Listing page) on sites operated by LR’s business partners, using technologies such as widgets or APIs.
            </p>
            <p></p><h4>3.9. Tax Authorities.</h4><p></p>
            <p>
                In jurisdictions where we facilitate the collection and remittance of occupancy taxes, Suppliers and Guests expressly grant us permission, without further notice, to disclose Suppliers’ and Guests’ data and other information relating to them or to their transactions, bookings, Accommodations and occupancy taxes to the relevant tax authority, including, but not limited to, the Supplier’s or Guest’s name, listing addresses, transaction dates and amounts, tax identification number(s), the amount of taxes received (or due) by Suppliers from Guests, and contact information.
            </p>
            <p></p><h4>3.10. Business Transfers.</h4><p></p>
            <p>
                If LR undertakes or is involved in any merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or insolvency event, then we may sell, transfer or share some or all of our assets, including your personal information in connection with such transaction or in contemplation of such transaction (e.g., due diligence). In this event, we will notify you before your personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
            </p>
            <p></p><h4>3.11. Aggregated Data.</h4><p></p>
            <p>
                We may also share aggregated information (information about our users that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or references an individual user) and other de-identified information for industry and market analysis, regulatory compliance, demographic profiling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes.
            </p>
            <p></p><h3>4. Other Important Information</h3><p></p>
            <p></p><h4>4.1. Analyzing your Communications.</h4><p></p>
            <p>
                We may review, scan, or analyze your communications on the LR Platform for fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research, and customer support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts, we scan and analyze messages to mask contact information and references to other websites. In some cases, we may also scan, review, or analyze messages to debug, improve, and expand product offerings. We use automated methods where reasonably possible. However, occasionally we may need to manually review some communications, such as for fraud investigations and customer support, or to assess and improve the functionality of these automated tools. We will not review, scan, or analyze your communications to send third party marketing messages to you, and we will not sell reviews or analyses of these communications.
            </p>
            <p>
                These activities are carried out based on LR’s legitimate interest in ensuring compliance with applicable laws, preventing fraud, promoting safety, and improving and ensuring the adequate performance of our services.
            </p>
            <p></p><h4>4.2 Linking Third Party Accounts.</h4><p></p>
            <p>You may link your LR account with your account at a third party social networking service. When you create this link:</p>
            <p>
                </p><ol>
                    <li>the information you provide to us from the linking of your accounts may be stored, processed and transmitted for fraud prevention and risk assessment purposes; and</li>

            <p></p>
            <p>
                We only collect your information from linked third party accounts to the extent necessary to ensure the adequate performance of our contract with you, or to ensure that we comply with applicable laws, or with your consent.

LR doesn’t own or control these Third Party Partners and when you interact with them, you may be providing information directly to the Third Party Partner, Airbnb, or both. These Third Party Partners will have their own rules about the collection, use, and disclosure of information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of the other websites you visit.

                    <li>Some copies of your information (e.g. log records) may remain in our database, but are disassociated from personal identifiers.</li>
                    <li>Because we maintain the LR Platform to protect from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.</li>

            <p></p><h4>6.3 Withdrawing Consent.</h4><p></p>

                In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to request a copy of your personal information that you have provided to us and/or to request us to move such personal information to another service provider. In such cases, and in line with our legal obligations, we will provide you or the service provider with information in a structured and commonly used format.

                In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to require LR not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes, such as profiling or marketing purposes.
            </p>
            <p></p><h4>6.7 Exercising Rights and Lodging Complaints.</h4><p></p>
            <p>
                If you would like to learn more about, or exercise any of, the rights described in this Section 6, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@luxuryretreats.com">privacy@luxuryretreats.com</a>. We may ask you to verify your identity before taking further action on your request. You have the right to lodge complaints about the data processing activities carried out by LR before competent data protection authorities.

            <p></p><h3>7. Operating Globally</h3><p></p>
            <p>
                As described in this Privacy Policy, we may sometimes share your information within our family of companies or with third parties.
            </p>
            <p></p><h4>7.1 Service Providers.</h4><p></p>
            <p>
                Where we engage third party service providers to help us provide services related to the LR Platform, we may need to transfer them your personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. These services providers may be located inside or outside of the European Economic Area (“<b>EEA</b>”), including in countries that are considered to provide a level of data protection equivalent to that provided in the EEA (like Canada) and other countries that do not, including the United States and Barbados. When transferring your personal information to service providers in these countries, we will ensure that such information is processed there in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you use the LR Platform, you authorize us to transfer, store, and process your information in such countries. Laws in these countries may differ from the laws applicable to the place where you live. By using the LR Platform, you consent to transferring your data to these countries.
            </p>

            <p></p><h4>7.2 California Residents.</h4><p></p>
            <p>
                California law permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of third parties to whom we have disclosed their personal information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year. LR does not share personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes without your prior consent. Accordingly, you can prevent disclosure of your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes by withholding consent. If you do opt-in to receiving marketing and other communications from a third party, please be advised that the information you elect to share with that third party will be governed by the third party’s privacy policy and terms of service, and we encourage you to review those policies before providing consent for LR to share your information.
            </p>
            <p></p><h3>8. Security</h3><p></p>
            <p>
                We are continuously implementing and updating administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your information against unauthorized access, loss, destruction, or alteration.
            </p>
            <p></p><h3>9. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3><p></p>
            <p>
                LR reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time in accordance with this provision. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy on the LR Platform and update the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy. We will also provide you with notice of the modification by email at least thirty (30) days before the date they become effective. If you disagree with the revised Privacy Policy, you may cancel your Account. If you do not cancel your LR account before the date the revised Privacy Policy becomes effective, your continued access or use of the LR Platform will constitute acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
            </p>

            <h5 class="PrivacyTerms__lastupdated">Last updated: May, 2018</h5>
            <p>
                Luxury Retreats (“<b>LR</b>”) uses cookies and similar technologies to help provide, protect, and improve the LR Platform. This policy explains how and why we use these technologies and the choices you have.
            </p>
            <p>
                A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your device (e.g. your phone or your computer). For example, a cookie could allow us to recognize your browser, while another could store your preferences. There are two types of cookies used on the LR Platform: (1) “session cookies” and (2) “persistent cookies.” Session cookies normally expire when you close your browser, while persistent cookies remain on your device after you close your browser, and can be used again the next time you access the LR Platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also use other technologies with similar functionality to cookies, such as web beacons, pixels, mobile identifiers, and tracking URLs, to obtain Log Data (as described in the <u>Privacy Policy</u>). For example, our email messages may contain web beacons and tracking URLs to determine whether you have opened a certain message or accessed a certain link.
            </p>
            <p></p><h3>Why LR Uses These Technologies</h3><p></p>
            <p>We use these technologies for a number of purposes, such as:</p>
            <p>
                </p><ol>
                    <li>To enable you to use and access the LR Platform and the Payment Services (each of those terms is defined in our <a href="#terms">Privacy Policy</a>).</li>
                    <li>To enable, facilitate and streamline the functioning of and your access to the LR Platform.</li>
                    <li>To better understand how you navigate through and interact with the LR Platform and to improve the LR Platform.</li>
                    <li>To serve you tailored advertising (on the LR Platform and on third party websites).</li>
                    <li>To show you content (e.g., advertisements) that is more relevant to you.</li>
                    <li>To monitor and analyze the performance, operation, and effectiveness of the LR Platform and LR advertisements.</li>
                    <li>To enforce legal agreements that govern use of the LR Platform.</li>
                    <li>For fraud detection and prevention, and investigations.</li>
                    <li>For purposes of our own customer support, analytics, research, product development, and regulatory compliance.</li>
                </ol>
            <p></p>
            <p></p><h3>Third Parties</h3><p></p>
            <p>
                We may also allow certain business partners to place these technologies on the LR Platform. These partners use these technologies to (1) help us analyze how you use the LR Platform, such as by noting the third party services from which you arrived, (2) market and advertise LR services to you on the LR Platform and third party websites, (3) help us detect or prevent fraud or conduct risk assessments, or (4) collect information about your activities on the LR Platform, other sites, and/or the ads you have clicked on. For example, to help us better understand how people use the LR Platform, we work with a number of analytics partners, including Google Analytics. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser by <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.
            </p>
            <p></p><h4 id="OnlineAdvertising">Online Advertising</h4><p></p>
            <p>
                Third parties may also use such tracking technologies to serve ads that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you and measure the effectiveness of their ads both on the LR Platform and on other websites and online services. Targeting and advertising cookies we use may include Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Criteo, OpenX, Pubmatic, StackAdapt, AppNexus and other advertising networks and services we use from time to time. For more information about targeting and advertising cookies and how you can opt out, you can visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative’s opt-out page</a>, the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page</a>, or <a href="http://youronlinechoices.eu" target="_blank">http://youronlinechoices.eu</a>. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">Google Ads Settings</a> page. To the extent advertising technology is integrated into the LR Platform and you opt-out of tailored advertising, you may still receive advertising content. In that case, the advertising content will just not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of these opt-out links and are not responsible for the availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
            </p>
            <p></p><h3>Third Party Social Plugins</h3><p></p>
            <p>
                The LR Platform may use social plugins provided and operated by third parties, such as Facebook’s Like Button. As a result of this, you may send to the third party the information that you are viewing on a certain part of the LR Platform. If you are not logged into your account with the third party, then the third party may not know your identity. If you are logged in to your account with the third party, then the third party may be able to link information or actions about your interactions with the LR Platform to your account with them. Please refer to the third party’s privacy policies to learn more about its data practices.
            </p>
            <p></p><h3>Your Choices</h3><p></p>
            <p>
                Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies by visiting the Help portion of your browser’s toolbar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove flash cookies. To learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/" target="_blank">Adobe website</a> and make changes at the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html" target="_blank">Global Privacy Settings Panel</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your mobile device may allow you to control cookies through its settings function. Refer to your device manufacturer’s instructions for more information.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you choose to decline cookies, some parts of the LR Platform may not work as intended or may not work at all.
