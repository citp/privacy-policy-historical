Our Committment To Your Privacy 

Luxury Insider collects personal information for one reason only: it helps us deliver the content and information that you want. It also allows us to keep you updated of changes to our website, as well as relevant news about products and services you might like to hear about. 

**Your privacy is of paramount concern at Luxury Insider.** We will never sell, rent, or transfer your information in any form to other marketers. 

Luxury Insider is a magazine focused on uber-luxe products and services, and we may come across information which we think may be interesting to you. If you have opted to receive emails from us, we may occasionally send you such information via email, but such emails will be sent 

_no more than once per fortnight_

. Such information is sent purely at your pleasure and you may stop the further sending of such emails at any time by following the instructions given in the email to you. 

When Information Is Collected

Much of the content on our website is viewable only to registered readers. 

During registration, certain information will be required like your name, your country of residence, your gender, your age group, and a valid email address. 

Like most websites, our website uses cookies to understand viewer preferences, such as which pages are most popular, how much time is spent on each page, etc. While this cookie can tell us when you enter our sites and which pages you visit, it cannot read data off your hard disk. 

For third party accountability, Luxury Insider has engaged the independent web audit company Nielsen//Netratings to measure and analyse the traffic on our website. Nielsen//Netratings is a leader in the internet industry in interactive measurement technologies and market research. 

The traffic analysis done by Nielsen//Netratings is on a strictly aggregate and anonymous basis. We will never marry any of the aggregate information collected by Nielsen//Netratings to the personal information collected on our website. 

Strict Non-Disclosure Principle

**We will never sell, rent, or transfer your personal information to third party marketers.**

We may, for technical and/or administrative reasons, provide information to other companies who do work on our behalf. An example of one of these companies would be our hosting providers. We endeavour to pick only reputable third parties to ensure integrity and privacy of your information. 

We will never disclose your personal information to any other third party, save for when compelled by law. 

Protection Of Information Within Our Company

Only specific authorized employees will have access to all information collected on the website. Employees who violate our Privacy Policy will be subject to our disciplinary process.
