of data from the European Union.

</p><h2>General usage:</h2>

 <p>While visiting the Lux Scientiae web site, information is stored in a 
log file for the purpose of analyzing what pages are accessed, which files 
are downloaded, and what errors occur. We review which top domain 
addresses visit our site. This process does not collect any personal 
information about you or your business.

 </p><p>When you complete any form on our site including personal information 
such as your name, addresses, email, phone numbers, and other information, 
your information is written to a secure file or database and/or emailed to 
our staff. We will respond to your inquiry if applicable. 

</p><h2>Members:</h2>

 <p>We collect the names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of 
our users in order to identify them and provide billing and support 
services. Once a user has logged in to Lux Scientiae, cookies are used for 
authentication and verification purposes. Our cookies reside in a small 
file stored on your computer, which expire within 1 year (or sooner, 
depending on your personal preferences). Our cookies are linked to your 
personal information.  Our cookies do not track your movement throughout 
the Internet and do not, ever, send us information about you when you are 
not on our site.</p>

<h3>Third Party Tracking Technologies</h3>

 <p>The use of tracking technologies by our partners, tracking utility 
company, and service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We 
do not have access or control over these cookies.  Our partners, tracking 
utility company, and service providers may use session ID cookies to make 
it easier for you to navigate their web sites or to provide statistics to 
us on the usage of our web site.  </p>

<h3>Web beacons </h3>

 <p> Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons 
(sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to 
compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be 
used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been 
opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our 
customer communications and marketing campaigns.</p>


<h3>Newsletters</h3>

 <p>If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name 
and email address to send the newsletter to you.  Out of respect for your 
privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. </p>

<h3>Choice/Opt-out</h3>

 <p>We provide you the opportunity to "opt-out" of having your personally
identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this 
information.  For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not 
wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can 
indicate your preference on our order form. 

 </p><p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional 
communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the 
instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing 
us at "support at luxsci.com". We offer an opportunity to opt-out of 
certain communications on our personal profile update pages, or you may 
contact us at 1-800-441-6612, "support at luxsci.com", or Lux Scientiae, 
PO Box 326 Westwood, MA 02090 USA.</p>

<h3>OpenID</h3>

 <p>You can log in to our site using sign-in services such as an Open ID 
provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you 
the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name 
and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. </p>

 <p>Additionally, we record all logins to Lux Scientiae by our members and 
the pages visited by them. This is for security purposes and for the 
purpose of analyzing what pages and features are being used and with what 
frequency.</p>

<h2>Payments:</h2>

 <p>All payments to Lux Scientiae are made securely online via credit card 
or PayPal or offline via check, wire transfer, or direct deposit. After you 
have made a credit card payment, we keep your billing address in our 
secure database to facilitate future payments. We do not keep any record 
of your credit card number unless you authorize us to bill you 
automatically each month. In this case, your credit card information is 
stored in a PCI-compliant way, not on Lux Scientiae's servers.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

 <p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you
enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social 
security number, national ID, personal health information) on our 
registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure 
socket layer technology (SSL).  [To learn more about SSL, follow this link 
<a href="/blog/how-does-secure-socket-layer-ssl-or-tls-work.html">How Does 
Secure Socket Layer (SSL or TLS) Work?</a>]</p>
 
 <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the 
personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during 
transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the 
Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect 
your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<h2>Tell-A-Friend</h2>

 <p>If you choose to use our referral service to email a friend about our 
site, we will ask you for your friend.s name and email address.  We will 
automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to 
visit the site.  Lux Scientiae stores this information for the sole 
purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our 
referral program.  

</p><h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

 <p>If you click on a link to a third party site, you will leave the Lux 
Scientiae site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because 
we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept 
responsibility for any use of your personally identifiable information by 
such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the 
same privacy practices as Lux Scientiae. We encourage you to review the 
privacy statements of any other service provider from whom you request 
services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to an Lux 
Scientiae site, you should read that site.s privacy statement before 
providing any personally identifiable information.

</p><h2>Updating/Accessing/Amending/Correcting Personally Identifiable 
Information</h2>

 <p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no 
longer desire our service and would like to have your personally 
identifiable information deleted,  you may update it by making the change 
on our member profile page or by making a support ticket, or by contacting 
us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.  
We will respond to your request to access within 1 day. You can change your     
personal information online by logging into your "member portal", under 
"Account &gt; My profile".</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2> 

 <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active 
or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account 
or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services 
contact us at "support at LuxSci.com".  We will retain and use your 
information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve 
disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

<h2>Agents/Service Providers</h2>

 <p>We use other third parties such as a credit card processing company to 
bill you for goods and services and data center providers to provide the 
servers on which our live services reside.  When you sign up for services 
such as Premium Email Filtering, Premium Email Archival, SSL Certificates, 
DNS Service, Domain and Registration, we may share your name, physical 
address, and email address as necessary for the third party to provide 
that service. </p>

 <p>These third parties are prohibited from using your personally 
identifiable information for promotional purposes. </p>

<h2>Import Contacts</h2>

 <p>We provide an import contacts feature to help you keep in touch with 
your contacts by importing your existing contact list into your address 
books while you are logged into your portal account. </p>

 <p>When logged into the portal, third party personal information may be 
entered such as name, email, address, and other personal information. This 
information is only used for the purpose it is collected for. </p>


<h2>Non-disclosure:</h2>

 <p>Lux Scientiae will not release any information about its clients to 
third parties without the clients' explicit consent, except as required for 
compliance with local, state, and federal law or as further set forth 
below. </p>

 <p>We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required 
by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our 
rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal 
process served on our Web site.</p>

 <p>If you use a bulletin board, blog, or chat room on this Web site, you 
should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit 
there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and 
could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible 
for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums. 
Testimonials are also posted on our site and users have given permission 
to have their personal information submitted in these testimonials. </p>


<p>For Customers using Basic Dedicated Servers and Basic Shared Server 
Environments:

	</p><blockquote>

	<p>The Lux Scientiae Acceptable Use Policies specifically prohibit the 
use of our service for illegal activities. Therefore, you agree that Lux 
Scientiae may disclose any and all of your information including assigned 
IP numbers, account history, account use, etc. to any law enforcement 
agent who makes a verified written request, without further consent or 
notification to you. LuxSci, or its Basic Server Provider Partners, will 
verify the legitimacy and authenticity of any such request and determine 
if compliance with the request is required by local, state, or federal law 
or if, in its sole discretion, the request should be filled even if it is 
not required by local, state, or federal law. In addition, Lux Scientiae 
shall have the right to suspend or terminate all services, at its sole 
discretion, during such a legal investigation.</p>
	</blockquote>

<p>For all other Customers (i.e. Premium Shared Server Environments,
Private Cloud Server, and Premium Dedicated Servers):
	</p><blockquote>
	<p>You agree that Lux Scientiae may disclose any and all of your 
information including assigned IP numbers, account history, account use, 
etc. to any law enforcement agent who makes a verified written request, 
without further consent or notification to you. LuxSci will verify the 
legitimacy and authenticity of any such request and determine if 
compliance with the request is required by local, state, or federal law. 
Only if the request is verified and compliance is required will the 
request be filled. In addition, Lux Scientiae shall have the right to 
suspend or terminate all services, at its sole discretion, during such a 
legal investigation.</p>
	</blockquote>

 <p> Lux Scientiae does not give out its client's email addresses or send
SPAM. Lux Scientiae may occasionally send important announcements 
regarding Lux Scientiae services to its clients if they have not opted out 
of this notification service.</p>

 <p>For Customers that have a valid <a href="/extranet/hipaa-baa-standard.html">HIPAA Business Associate 
Agreement</a> (BAA) with Lux Scientiae, in the event of a conflict or 
inconsistency between the terms of this nondisclosure policy and those of 
the BAA, the terms of the BAA shall prevail.</p>

<h2>Confidentiality:</h2> 

 <p>Lux Scientiae staff will not examine the following classes of data 
without Customer's explicit consent:</p>

<ol>

	<li> Email: The content of sent and received email messages, with the
exception of the message metadata including: sender address, recipient 
addresses, message subject, message size, message id, IP address of the 
sending or connecting computers, and any message header information 
removed from messages for the purposes of outbound message anonymization.

	</li><li> WebAides: The content of all WebAides, including comments and
attachments

	</li><li> Widgets: The content of all Widgets, except the content of custom
or third party widgets that is defined directly as part of the widget 
definition.

of the files, not the list of what files are present and what directories 
they are located in.

</li></ol>

<p>Information that does not fall within the above classes of data (i.e. 
email message metadata) will still be kept in the strictest confidence in 
accordance with Lux Scientiae's non-disclosure policy.</p>

 <p>Exception 1: in a case where Lux Scientiae becomes aware of evidence of 
a possible violation by a client of its <a href="/extranet/aup.html">Acceptable Use Policy</a> and it concludes that
analysis of data is necessary in order to determine the facts, in order to 
prevent the sending of SPAM, Unsolicited Email, excessive utilization of 
system resources, or other violations of LuxSci's AUPs, Lux Scientiae will 
examine such client's data solely for such purpose. The contents of 
client's data will be kept in the strictest confidence in accordance with 
Lux Scientiae's non-disclosure policy. </p>

Outbound Email customers' bulk email practices. As stated in the <a href="/extranet/hvaup.html">High Volume AUP</a> (HVAUP), Lux Scientiae can
and will store and/or review the content of any or all outbound email 
messages sent via the High Volume service to ensure compliance with the 
High Volume Email Restrictions (see the HVAUP). </p>

 <p>Exception 3: for Customers that have a valid <a href="/extranet/hipaa-baa-standard.html">HIPAA Business Associate 
Agreement</a> (BAA) with Lux Scientiae, in the event of a conflict or 
inconsistency between the terms of this confidentiality policy and those 
of the BAA, the terms of the BAA shall prevail.</p>

health care providers who electronically transmit any health information 
in connection with transactions for which the U.S. Department of Health

Addendum to its Master Services Agreement (MSA). This is the "Business 
Associate Agreement" required for HIPAA compliance between Lux Scientiae, 
as the "Business Associate", and the Client, as the "Covered Entity". </p>

 <p>Due to the Security and Privacy restrictions imposed by the BAA and by 
HIPAA that are not required for other types of accounts, this Addendum is 
not automatically incorporated into new or existing Lux Scientiae
