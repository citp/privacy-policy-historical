<h2>Tracking Technologies</h2>

 <p>We, Lux Scientiae and our marketing partners, affiliates, or analytics 
or online chat service providers, use technologies such as cookies, 
beacons, tags, and scripts, to analyze trends, administer the website, 
tracking users' movements around the website, and to gather demographic 
information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based 
on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and 
aggregated basis.</p>


<h3>Cookies</h3>

 <p>We use cookies to collect information that allows us to optimize our web 
site for an optimal user experience.  We also use cookies for social media 
sharing and content remarketing.  Finally, cookies are used to remember 
user preferences and to enable our live web site chat functionality.</p>
 
 <p>Cookies are essential to the functionality of those parts of our web 
site that require a login.  Disabling cookies may render these web portals
non-functional.</p>

 <p>Visitors to the LuxSci web site have the option to control their cookie
preferences.  Non-essential cookies are not set until you explicitly opt 
into cookie use.  LuxSci permits you view and change your cookie preferences 
on demand.  These preferences are unique to your browser and last up to 1 year, 
or until you explicitly clear your cookies.  In your cookie preferences you 
can enable or disable use of cookies related to site "preferences" (i.e., 
functionality such as web chat and site usage history), "analytics" (i.e., 
functionality that allows us to optimize our site performance), and 
"marketing" (i.e., functionality that enables social media sharing and other 
cross-site information transfer).</p>


<h3>Social Media (Features) and Widgets</h3>

<p> Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as Twitter, 
Facebook, LinkedIn, a RSS Blog Feed, Widgets, a "Share This" button and 
interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect 
your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a 
cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features 
and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our 
Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy 
policy of the company providing it. </p>

<p> You can opt in or out of the use of social media features by enabling 
or disabling use of "marketing" cookies.</p>



<h3>Behavioral Targeting</h3>

<p> We partner with a third party ad network to manage our advertising on 
other sites.  Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to 
collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on 
this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon 
your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the 
purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a target="_blank" href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">Here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">Here</a>. 
Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will 
continue to receive generic ads.</p>

<p> You can opt in or out of behavioral targeting by enabling or disabling 
use of "marketing" cookies.</p>


<h3>Newsletters</h3>

 <p>If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name 
and email address to send the newsletter to you.  Out of respect for your 
privacy, we provide you ways to unsubscribe. </p>


<h3>Choice/Opt-out</h3>

 <p>We provide you the opportunity to "opt-out" of having your personally
identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this 
information.  For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not 
wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can 
indicate your preference on our order form. 

 </p><p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional 
communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the 
instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing 
us at "<span>support</span><b>@</b><span>LuxSci.com</span>". We 
offer an opportunity to opt-out of certain communications on our personal 
profile update pages, or you may contact us at 1-800-441-6612, 
"<span>support</span><b>@</b><span>LuxSci.com</span>", or Lux 
Scientiae, 15 Brook Street, Medfield, MA 02052 USA.</p>

<h3>HTML5 Local Storage</h3>

<p>We use Local Storage (LS) such as HTML5 to store content information 
and preferences in those parts of our site that require a login. Various 
browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSs.</p>



<h2>Payments</h2>

<p>All payments to Lux Scientiae are made securely online via credit card 
or PayPal or offline via check, wire transfer, or direct deposit. After you 
have made a credit card payment, we keep your billing address in our 
secure database to facilitate future payments and to protect against 
fraud. We do not keep any record of your credit card number unless you 
authorize us to bill you automatically each month. In this case, your 
credit card information is stored in a PCI-compliant way on the US-based 
servers of our trusted partner, Authorize.net</p>


<h2>Security</h2>

 <p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you
enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our 
registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using 
transport-layer security (TLS). [To learn more about TLS, follow this link 
<a href="/blog/how-does-secure-socket-layer-ssl-or-tls-work.html">How Does 
Secure Socket Layer (SSL or TLS) Work?</a>]</p>
 
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the 
personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during 
transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the 
Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect 
your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>


<h2>Tell-A-Friend</h2>

 <p>If you choose to use our referral service to email a friend about our 
site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.  We will 
automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to 
visit the site.  LuxSci stores this information for the sole purpose of 
sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral 
program.  </p>

<p>Your friend may contact us at 
<span>support</span><b>@</b><span>LuxSci.com</span> to request that 
we remove this information from our database.</p>


<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

 <p>If you click on a link to a third party site, you will leave the Lux 
Scientiae site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because 
we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept 
responsibility for any use of your personally identifiable information by 
such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the 
same privacy practices as Lux Scientiae. We encourage you to review the 
privacy statements of any other service provider from whom you request 
services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to an Lux 
Scientiae site, you should read that site's privacy statement before 
providing any personally identifiable information.

identifiable information deleted,  you may update it by making the change

<h2>Agents/Service Providers</h2>

 <p>We use other third parties such as a credit card processing company to

live chat, and data center providers to provide the servers on which our
live services reside. When you sign up for services such as Premium Email 
Filtering, Email Archival, SSL Certificates, DNS Service, Domain and 
Registration, SecureVideo, SecureChat, and MobileSync we may share your 
name, physical address, and email address as necessary for the third party 
to provide that service. </p>

 <p>These third parties are prohibited from using your personally 
identifiable information for promotional purposes. </p>


<h2>Import Contacts</h2>

 <p>We provide an import contacts feature to help you keep in touch with 
your contacts by importing your existing contact list into your address 
books while you are logged into your portal account. </p>

 <p>When logged into the portal, third party personal information may be

<p>In certain situations, Lux Scientiae may be required to disclose

 <p>If you use a bulletin board, blog, or chat room on this Web site, you 
should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit 
there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and 
could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible

to have their personal information submitted in these testimonials. With 
your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. To request
