## Tracking Technologies

We, Lux Scientiae and our marketing partners, affiliates, or analytics or online chat service providers, use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts, to analyze trends, administer the website, tracking users' movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.

### Cookies

We use cookies to collect information that allows us to optimize our web site for an optimal user experience. We also use cookies for social media sharing and content remarketing. Finally, cookies are used to remember user preferences and to enable our live web site chat functionality.

Cookies are essential to the functionality of those parts of our web site that require a login. Disabling cookies may render these web portals non-functional.

Visitors to the LuxSci web site have the option to control their cookie preferences. Non-essential cookies are not set until you explicitly opt into cookie use. LuxSci permits you view and change your cookie preferences on demand. These preferences are unique to your browser and last up to 1 year, or until you explicitly clear your cookies. In your cookie preferences you can enable or disable use of cookies related to site "preferences" (i.e., functionality such as web chat and site usage history), "analytics" (i.e., functionality that allows us to optimize our site performance), and "marketing" (i.e., functionality that enables social media sharing and other cross-site information transfer).

### Social Media (Features) and Widgets

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, a RSS Blog Feed, Widgets, a "Share This" button and interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

You can opt in or out of the use of social media features by enabling or disabling use of "marketing" cookies.

### Behavioral Targeting

We partner with a third party ad network to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking [Here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) and [Here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

You can opt in or out of behavioral targeting by enabling or disabling use of "marketing" cookies.

### Newsletters

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you ways to unsubscribe. 

### Choice/Opt-out

We provide you the opportunity to "opt-out" of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form. 

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at "support **@** LuxSci.com". We offer an opportunity to opt-out of certain communications on our personal profile update pages, or you may contact us at 1-800-441-6612, "support **@** LuxSci.com", or Lux Scientiae, 15 Brook Street, Medfield, MA 02052 USA.

### HTML5 Local Storage

We use Local Storage (LS) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences in those parts of our site that require a login. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSs.

## Payments

All payments to Lux Scientiae are made securely online via credit card or PayPal or offline via check, wire transfer, or direct deposit. After you have made a credit card payment, we keep your billing address in our secure database to facilitate future payments and to protect against fraud. We do not keep any record of your credit card number unless you authorize us to bill you automatically each month. In this case, your credit card information is stored in a PCI-compliant way on the US-based servers of our trusted partner, Authorize.net

## Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using transport-layer security (TLS). [To learn more about TLS, follow this link [How Does Secure Socket Layer (SSL or TLS) Work?](https://web.archive.org/blog/how-does-secure-socket-layer-ssl-or-tls-work.html)]

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Tell-A-Friend

If you choose to use our referral service to email a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. LuxSci stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. 

Your friend may contact us at support **@** LuxSci.com to request that we remove this information from our database.

## Links to Other Sites

If you click on a link to a third party site, you will leave the Lux Scientiae site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personally identifiable information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as Lux Scientiae. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to an Lux Scientiae site, you should read that site's privacy statement before providing any personally identifiable information.

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service and would like to have your personally identifiable information deleted, you may update it by making the change on our member profile page or by making a support ticket, or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. We will respond to your request to access within 1 day. You can change your personal information online by logging into your "member portal", under "Account > Contact Information". 

## Agents/Service Providers

We use other third parties such as a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services, a customer service provider that hosts our live chat, and data center providers to provide the servers on which our live services reside. When you sign up for services such as Premium Email Filtering, Email Archival, SSL Certificates, DNS Service, Domain and Registration, SecureVideo, SecureChat, and MobileSync we may share your name, physical address, and email address as necessary for the third party to provide that service. 

These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for promotional purposes. 

## Import Contacts

We provide an import contacts feature to help you keep in touch with your contacts by importing your existing contact list into your address books while you are logged into your portal account. 

When logged into the portal, third party personal information may be entered such as name, email, address, and other personal information. This information is only used for the purpose it is collected for. 

## Non-disclosure

Lux Scientiae will not release any information about its clients to third parties without the clients' explicit consent, except as required for compliance with local, state, and federal law or as further set forth below. 

In certain situations, Lux Scientiae may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial or bankruptcy proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site. If Lux Scientiae is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

If you use a bulletin board, blog, or chat room on this Web site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums. Testimonials are also posted on our site and users have given permission to have their personal information submitted in these testimonials. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. To request removal of your personal information from these public areas of our site, contact us at privacy-officer **@** LuxSci.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. Alternatively, if you used a third party application to post such information, you may be able to remove it by either logging into the said application and removing the information or by contacting the appropriate third party application. 

Some of our blogs (e.g. [LuxSci Status](https://status.luxsci.com/)) are managed by a third party application that may require you to register. We do not have access or control of the information posted to the blog. You will need to contact or login into the third party application if you want your personal information that was posted to the comments section removed. To learn how the third party application uses your information, please review their privacy statement.

You agree that Lux Scientiae may disclose any and all of your information including assigned IP numbers, account history, account use, etc., to any law enforcement agent who makes a verified written request, without further consent or notification to you. LuxSci will verify the legitimacy and authenticity of any such request and determine if compliance with the request is required by local, state, or federal law. Only if the request is verified and compliance is required will the request be filled. In addition, Lux Scientiae shall have the right to suspend or terminate all services, at its sole discretion, during or as a result of such a legal investigation.

Lux Scientiae does not give out its client's email addresses or send SPAM. Lux Scientiae may occasionally send important announcements regarding Lux Scientiae services to its customers if they have not opted out of this notification service.

For Customers that have a valid [HIPAA Business Associate Agreement](https://web.archive.org/extranet/hipaa-baa-standard.html) (BAA) with Lux Scientiae, in the event of a conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this nondisclosure policy and those of the BAA, the terms of the BAA shall prevail.

## Confidentiality

Lux Scientiae staff will not examine the following classes of data without Customer's explicit consent:

  1. Email: The content of sent and received email messages, with the exception of the message metadata including: sender address, recipient addresses, message subject, message size, message id, IP address of the sending or connecting computers, and any message header information removed from messages for the purposes of outbound message anonymization. 
  2. WebAides: The content of all WebAides, including comments and attachments 
  3. Widgets: The content of all Widgets, except the content of custom or third party widgets that is defined directly as part of the widget definition.

  5. Files: The content of all files saved to the Customers web/FTP space, except as they may otherwise be publicly accessible on the Internet via Customer's web site. Note that this covers only the content of the files, not the list of what files are present and what directories they are located in. 



Information that does not fall within the above classes of data (i.e. email message metadata) will still be kept in the strictest confidence in accordance with Lux Scientiae's non-disclosure policy.

Exception 1: in a case where Lux Scientiae becomes aware of evidence of a possible violation by a client of its [Acceptable Use Policy](https://web.archive.org/extranet/aup.html) and it concludes that analysis of data is necessary in order to determine the facts, in order to prevent the sending of SPAM, Unsolicited Email, excessive utilization of system resources, or other violations of LuxSci's AUPs, Lux Scientiae will examine such client's data solely for such purpose. The contents of client's data will be kept in the strictest confidence in accordance with Lux Scientiae's non-disclosure policy. 

Exception 2: from time to time Lux Scientiae may audit High Volume Outbound Email customers' bulk email practices. As stated in the [High Volume AUP](https://web.archive.org/extranet/hvaup.html) (HVAUP), Lux Scientiae can and will store and/or review the content of any or all outbound email messages sent via the High Volume service to ensure compliance with the High Volume Email Restrictions (see the HVAUP). 

Exception 3: for Customers that have a valid [HIPAA Business Associate Agreement](https://web.archive.org/extranet/hipaa-baa-standard.html) (BAA) with Lux Scientiae, in the event of a conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this confidentiality policy and those of the BAA, the terms of the BAA shall prevail.

## Medical privacy (HIPAA)

Clients that are legally required to abide by the regulations of HIPAA (i.e. HIPAA Covered Entities and HIPAA Business Associates), Lux Scientiae has the following Addendum to its Master Services Agreement (MSA). This is the "Business Associate Agreement" required for HIPAA compliance between Lux Scientiae, as the "Business Associate", and the Client, as the "Covered Entity". 

Due to the Security and Privacy restrictions imposed by the BAA and by HIPAA that are not required for other types of accounts, this Addendum is not automatically incorporated into new or existing Lux Scientiae accounts. If you require a BAA with Lux Scientiae, please print out and sign the BAA and Account Restrictions Agreement using the links below and return them to Lux Scientiae for review and acceptance. LUX SCIENTIAE WILL NOT BE DEEMED A BUSINESS ASSOCIATE OF ANY CUSTOMER FOR PURPOSES OF HIPAA UNLESS AND UNTIL A SIGNED ADDENDUM IS RECEIVED, REVIEWED, AND ACCEPTED BY THE LUX SCIENTIAE HIPAA PRIVACY OFFICER.

  * Data Breaches: Our breach procedures ensure that we have safeguards and measures in place to identify, assess, investigate and report any personal data breach at the earliest possible time. 
  * Subject Access Request (SAR): We have implemented a subject request form to accommodate the 30-day time frame for providing the requested information and for making this provision free of charge. Our new procedures detail how to verify the data subject, what steps to take for processing an access request, what exemptions apply and a suite of response templates to ensure that communications with data subjects are compliant, consistent and adequate.
