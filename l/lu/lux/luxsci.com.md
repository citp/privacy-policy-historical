You can log in to our site using sign-in services such as an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. 

Additionally, we record all logins to Lux Scientiae by our members and the pages visited by them. This is for security purposes and for the purpose of analyzing what pages and features are being used and with what frequency.

### Social Media (Features) and Widgets

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

## Payments

All payments to Lux Scientiae are made securely online via credit card or PayPal or offline via check, wire transfer, or direct deposit. After you have made a credit card payment, we keep your billing address in our secure database to facilitate future payments. We do not keep any record of your credit card number unless you authorize us to bill you automatically each month. In this case, your credit card information is stored in a PCI-compliant way, not on Lux Scientiae's servers.

## Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number, national ID, personal health information) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). [To learn more about SSL, follow this link [How Does Secure Socket Layer (SSL or TLS) Work?](https://web.archive.org/blog/how-does-secure-socket-layer-ssl-or-tls-work.html)]

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Tell-A-Friend

If you choose to use our referral service to email a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Lux Scientiae stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. 

## Links to Other Sites

If you click on a link to a third party site, you will leave the Lux Scientiae site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personally identifiable information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as Lux Scientiae. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to an Lux Scientiae site, you should read that site's privacy statement before providing any personally identifiable information.

If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at "support **@** LuxSci.com". We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

## Agents/Service Providers

We use other third parties such as a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services, a customer service provider that hosts our live chat, and data center providers to provide the servers on which our live services reside. When you sign up for services such as Premium Email Filtering, Premium Email Archival, SSL Certificates, DNS Service, Domain and Registration, we may share your name, physical address, and email address as necessary for the third party to provide that service. 

These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for promotional purposes.

For Customers that have a valid [HIPAA Business Associate Agreement](https://web.archive.org/extranet/hipaa-baa-standard.html) (BAA) with Lux Scientiae, in the event of a conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this nondisclosure policy and those of the BAA, the terms of the BAA shall prevail.

## Confidentiality

Lux Scientiae staff will not examine the following classes of data without Customer's explicit consent:

  1. Email: The content of sent and received email messages, with the exception of the message metadata including: sender address, recipient addresses, message subject, message size, message id, IP address of the sending or connecting computers, and any message header information removed from messages for the purposes of outbound message anonymization. 
  2. WebAides: The content of all WebAides, including comments and attachments 
  3. Widgets: The content of all Widgets, except the content of custom or third party widgets that is defined directly as part of the widget definition.

  5. Files: The content of all files saved to the Customers web/FTP space, except as they may otherwise be publicly accessible on the Internet via Customer's web site.

Information that does not fall within the above classes of data (i.e. email message metadata) will still be kept in the strictest confidence in accordance with Lux Scientiae's non-disclosure policy.

Exception 1: in a case where Lux Scientiae becomes aware of evidence of a possible violation by a client of its [Acceptable Use Policy](https://web.archive.org/extranet/aup.html) and it concludes that analysis of data is necessary in order to determine the facts, in order to prevent the sending of SPAM, Unsolicited Email, excessive utilization of system resources, or other violations of LuxSci's AUPs, Lux Scientiae will examine such client's data solely for such purpose. The contents of client's data will be kept in the strictest confidence in accordance with Lux Scientiae's non-disclosure policy. 

Exception 2: from time to time Lux Scientiae may audit High Volume Outbound Email customers' bulk email practices. As stated in the [High Volume AUP](https://web.archive.org/extranet/hvaup.html) (HVAUP), Lux Scientiae can and will store and/or review the content of any or all outbound email messages sent via the High Volume service to ensure compliance with the High Volume Email Restrictions (see the HVAUP). 

Exception 3: for Customers that have a valid [HIPAA Business Associate Agreement](https://web.archive.org/extranet/hipaa-baa-standard.html) (BAA) with Lux Scientiae, in the event of a conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this confidentiality policy and those of the BAA, the terms of the BAA shall prevail.

## Medical privacy (HIPAA)

Clients that are legally required to abide by the regulations of HIPAA (i.e. HIPAA Covered Entities and Business Associates of HIPAA Covered Entities, namely, (1) health plans, (2) health care clearinghouses, or (3) health care providers who electronically transmit any health information in connection with transactions for which the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has adopted standards), Lux Scientiae has the following Addendum to its Master Services Agreement (MSA). This is the "Business Associate Agreement" required for HIPAA compliance between Lux Scientiae, as the "Business Associate", and the Client, as the "Covered Entity". 

Due to the Security and Privacy restrictions imposed by the BAA and by HIPAA that are not required for other types of accounts, this Addendum is not automatically incorporated into new or existing Lux Scientiae accounts. If you require a BAA with Lux Scientiae, please print out and sign the BAA and Account Restrictions Agreement using the links below and return them to Lux Scientiae for review and acceptance. LUX SCIENTIAE WILL NOT BE DEEMED A BUSINESS ASSOCIATE OF ANY CUSTOMER FOR PURPOSES OF HIPAA UNLESS AND UNTIL A SIGNED ADDENDUM IS RECEIVED, REVIEWED, AND ACCEPTED BY THE LUX SCIENTIAE HIPAA PRIVACY OFFICER.
