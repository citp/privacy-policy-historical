# Lubrizol Privacy and Cookie Policy - Lubrizol

The Lubrizol Corporation and its affiliates (collectively "Lubrizol") respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information that you may provide while using our websites. This policy describes the ways that information about our website visitors is collected, how that information is used, and how someone can request changes to the way their personal information is used or shared.

## Anonymous Information 

Anonymous information is unidentified information and is not associated with an individual. 

We may use anonymous cookies (See Cookies) to collect demographic information, track site metrics, or provide a richer experience for site visitors. Anonymous cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information. 

## Personally Identifiable Information 

Personally identifiable information (PII) is information that can identify you, such as your name, email address, address, and telephone number. 

We collect PII that you choose to provide to us when you register for access to a secure website; register for email newsletters; participate in surveys; request samples; request literature not on the site; or complete inquiry forms. When you provide this information to us, you are no longer anonymous for that activity. 

## How We Use Your Personally Identifiable Information

We make every effort to let you know before we collect PII via our websites. If you choose to provide PII via our websites, we want you know how we may use such information. We may use PII to:

  * provide you with product information 
  * allow you to purchase products 
  * market products to you 
  * send you email notices or newsletters at your request* 
  * communicate with you for other purposes



_*All email messages you receive from us will allow you to opt out of future emails._ __

## How We Keep Your Information Secure 

We are committed to protect personally identifiable information that you provide to us. Lubrizol does not intend to sell or otherwise disseminate your   
personally identifiable information to third parties without your permission. 

We use reasonable precautions to protect personally identifiable information, including technical, administrative, and physical procedures. 

In the event of a data breach, a notification will appear on the website within 72 hours of the breach.

When we contract with other companies to provide us with web services, we only share personally identifiable information with those that we believe share our commitment to privacy and information security. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for the actions of these parties and your use of the site is subject to [Lubrizol’s Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/Legal/Terms-of-Use). 

Lubrizol is not responsible for the information you volunteer about yourself in posting comments, discussion forums or other publicly accessible interactions.
