# Privacy Notice - Lucy Who

Lucy Who knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. By visiting Lucy Who, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice. 

**What Personal Information About Users Does Lucy Who Gather?**  
The information we learn from users helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at Lucy Who. Here are the types of information we gather. 

**Information You Give Us:** We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future browsing for you, improving our site, and communicating with you. 

**Does Lucy Who Share the Information It Receives?**  
Information about our users is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. Thus, for example, Lucy Who does not sell, and will never sell, information about you to external marketers, list brokers, or other third parties without user consent. Nor will we give such information to affiliated businesses or companies that we team up with to provide co-branded or jointly owned offerings unless you choose to take advantage of those offerings, and even then, any sharing of information is limited to information relating to the offering. Further, whenever we deal with user information, we will always comply with applicable laws and regulations in doing so. 

We share user information with our parent entity, the subsidiaries it controls, and as described below. 

**Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:** We work closely with our affiliated businesses. In some cases, we will include offerings from these businesses on Lucy Who. In other cases, we may include joint offerings from Lucy Who and these businesses on Lucy Who. You can tell when another business is involved in the offering, and we share user information related to those offerings with that business. 

**Agents:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from user lists, analyzing data, and providing marketing assistance. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 

**Business Transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy additional services or business units. In such transactions, user information generally is transferred along with the rest of the service or business unit. Also, in the event that Lucy Who, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, user information will of course be included in the transaction. 

**Protection of Lucy Who and Others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Lucy Who, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection. 

Other than as set out above, you will always receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. 

**What About Third-Party Advertisers?**  
Our site includes third-party advertising, and some of our advertisers use third-party companies to serve their advertisements that appear on our site. Often, these third-party advertising companies, called "ad networks" or "network advertisers", employ cookie and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to show you ads that are more relevant and interesting to you. We do not provide any user information to them, and we do not have access to or control cookies that may be placed by the ad networks. If you would like more information about the ad networks, including information about how to opt-out of their information collection, the National Advertising Initiative offers useful information on its Web site. 

**How Secure Is Information About Me?**  
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. 

**What Choices and Access Do I Have?**  
As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to take advantage of some Lucy Who features. 

The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, you will not be able to use some features if you do not use cookies. 

The Federal Trade Commission provides useful information about online privacy on its own Web site. 

**Children**  
Lucy Who is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, you may not submit information about yourself to Lucy Who. 

**Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions**  
If you choose to visit Lucy Who, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Terms and Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law. If you have any concern about privacy at Lucy Who, please send us a thorough description to our help desk, and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly. This Notice and the Terms and Conditions of Use will change also, and use of information that we gather now is subject to the Privacy Notice in effect at the time of use. You should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes.
