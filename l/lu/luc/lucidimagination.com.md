By visiting the Lucidworks web sites, you accept the practices described in this privacy policy. This privacy policy applies to anonymous data and personal information collected at our web sites, and to personal information collected in connection with the sale, support and use of our products and services. This privacy policy also applies where you are a customer or user of any of our hosted service offerings, for example, our services Lucidworks.io. and Lucidworks Search.

## Part I. Information Collection

We may collect personal information through our web sites. This information is used in e-commerce transactions and to provide customer service and support.

Lucidworks web sites collect personal information at several points, including processes associated with e-commerce, product registration, account creation and e-mail opt-in. Visitors may voluntarily provide (and we will collect) information including: name, email address, billing and shipping information, product purchase information, and product registration information.

We also collect the personal information that is provided by visitors who submit it through our web sites.

We may collect information related to the use of our web sites – through, for example, the use of cookies – in order to better understand our customers’ needs. A cookie is a small text file that our web server places on your computer hard drive that includes a unique identifier. Cookies enable us to track usage patterns and deliver customized content to users. We may also use web bugs, clear gifs and similar technologies that collect data similar to that collected by a cookie. You may disable cookies by following instructions provided in your Internet browser. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited.

Our service providers use both session ID and persistent cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. The use of cookies by our service providers is covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

Our third party partners employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage content on our site. We do tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ personally identifiable information.

## Part II. Information Usage

The information collected by us is used to understand how customers are using our products and services in order to make them better.

Personal information is used to fulfill orders, provide customer support, and for marketing purposes such as email announcements of new products or offers. We provide an option for you to choose not to receive marketing communications and you may always contact us at info@Lucidworks.com to opt-out of marketing communications (however, we reserve the right to use your contact information if we consider it necessary to send you crucial information about the product or services you have purchased from us.)

If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact us at info@Lucidworks.com.

We may use third parties (including contractors and service providers) to help with certain aspects of our operations, which may require disclosure of your personal information to them. For example, we may use a third party to communicate with you (via telephone, email, or letter) about our products or services, to send information to you, to process and collect payment via your credit card (if applicable), and to perform other work that we may need to outsource. We require these contractors and third parties to use your personal information only as necessary to perform the services they are asked to perform.

We may share some or all of your personal information with our current or future “affiliates” (which means a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control), in which case we will require our affiliates to honor this privacy policy. If another company acquires Lucidworks (or a business unit of Lucidworks that uses your personal information), that company will possess the personal information collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this privacy policy. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

We offer links to other web sites. Please note: those other web sites may observe privacy standards different from ours and the collection and use of your personal information will be governed by the privacy policies on those other sites.

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook button [and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site]. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

### Blogs

Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.

### Tell-A-Friend

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. [Lucidworks] stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.

Your friend may contact us at info@Lucidworks.com to request that we remove this information from our database.

## Part IV. Data Storage and Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We use industry-standard methods of securing electronic databases of personal information. Except as provided elsewhere in this privacy policy, we limit access to personal information in electronic databases to those persons in our organization who have a business need for such access. However, you should know that no web site operator, including Lucidworks, can fully eliminate security risks associated with personal information.

Your privacy is very important to us. Due to factors beyond our control, however, we cannot fully ensure that your personal information will not be disclosed to third parties other than those mentioned above. For example, we may be legally required to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.

### Information Related to Data Collected through the Lucidworks Search service

Lucidworks’ hosted service offerings, for example, the Lucidworks Search service, may store electronic data, text, queries and other information provided by our customers, some of which may be personal information. Lucidworks collects information under the direction of our customers, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data we process. We do not own or control any of the information we process on behalf of our customers. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the responsible Lucidworks customer (the data controller). If the responsible customer requests Lucidworks to remove the data, we will respond to their request within 30 business days. We receive information transferred from our customers merely as a data processor, and typically do not collect, access, transfer or use any of this information ourselves. At the direction of our customers, we may perform query operations or transfer data to third parties for hosting purposes or integration with third party software products or services. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this Policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our customers. Any access to or use of personal information by us is incidental to performing our contractual obligations to our customers as a data processor. We rely on our customers to ensure that personal information is relevant for the purposes for which it is used, reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete and current, and is collected, accessed, transferred and used in a manner that does not infringe the rights or privacy of any individual and does not violate any applicable law, regulation or directive. If you are an individual who has a relationship with one of our customers and would no longer like to be contacted by that customer, please contact that customer directly.

### Data Retention

Lucidworks will retain personal data we process on behalf of our customers for as long as needed to provide services to our customers. Lucidworks will retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
