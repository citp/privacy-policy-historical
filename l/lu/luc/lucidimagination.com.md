# Privacy Policy | Lucid Imagination

This Privacy Policy statement describes our practices regarding how information we collect on the Lucid Imagination Web sites is used and shared with third parties. By visiting the Lucid Imagination Web sites, you accept the practices described in this statement. This statement applies to anonymous data and personal information collected at the Lucid Imagination Web sites. This statement also applies to personally identifiable customer information collected in connection with the sale, support and use of Lucid Imagination Products and Services.

## Part I. Information Collection

Lucid Imagination collects personally identifiable information through our Web sites. This information is used in e-commerce transactions and to provide customer service and support.

Lucid Imagination Web sites collect personally identifiable information at several points, including processes associated with e-commerce, product registration, account creation and e-mail opt-in. Visitors may voluntarily provide (and we will collect) information including: name, email address, billing and shipping information, product purchase information, and product registration information.

We also collect the personal information of third parties that is provided by visitors who submit that personal data through our Web sites.

We may collect information related to the use of our Web sites - through, for example, the use of cookies - in order to better understand our customers' needs. A cookie is a small text file that our Web server places on your computer hard drive that includes a unique identifier. Cookies enable Lucid Imagination to track usage patterns and deliver customized content to users.

If you do not wish Lucid Imagination to use your information as described in this section, please follow the procedure in Part III (Access to Your Information) below.

In order to protect the privacy interests of younger Internet users, we do not actively market our Web sites or products to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 for marketing purposes. We encourage children of any age to visit our Web sites or to use our Products and Service only with the supervision of their parents.

## Part II. Information Usage

Information collected by Lucid Imagination is used to understand how customers are using our Products and Services in order to make them better.

Anonymous, aggregated data is analyzed on a regular basis to understand product use and quality, feature popularity, quality, and to assist in the design of future products and services.

Personal information is used to fulfill orders, provide customer support, and for marketing purposes such as email announcements of new products or offers. We provide an option for you to choose not to receive marketing communications and you may always contact us at [info@lucidimagination.com](mailto:info@lucidimagination.com) to opt-out of marketing communications (however, we reserve the right to use your contact information if we consider it necessary to send you crucial information about the product or services you have purchased from us.)

Lucid Imagination may also share information with companies integral to the use of the product. In those cases, the use of that information is subject to the privacy policies of the receiving party.

Lucid Imagination uses third parties (including contractors and service providers) to help with certain aspects of its operations, which may require disclosure of your personal information to them. For example, Lucid Imagination may use a third party to communicate with you (via telephone, email, or letter) about our Products or Services, to send information to you, to process and collect payment via your credit card (if applicable), and to perform other work that we may need to outsource. Lucid Imagination requires these contractors and third parties to use your personal information only as necessary to perform the services they are asked to perform.

We may share some or all of your personal information with our current or future "affiliates" (which means a parent Lucid Imagination, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control), in which case we will require our affiliates to honor this privacy policy. If another Lucid Imagination acquires Lucid Imagination (or a business unit of Lucid Imagination that uses your personal information), that Lucid Imagination will possess the personal information collected by Lucid Imagination and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this privacy policy.

We offer links to other Web sites. Please note: those other Web sites may observe privacy standards different from ours and the collection and use of your personal information will be governed by the privacy policies on those other sites.

Our Web sites offer a space for postings and submissions. Please be advised that any information posted in these venues will be publicly available.

Finally, please be assured that Lucid Imagination does not sell information collected from customers.

## Part III. Access to Your Information

If you wish to correct or delete of any of your personal information held by us or a change in the way we use your information, please contact support at [info@lucidimagination.com](mailto:info@lucidimagination.com). We will use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill your request in a timely manner, but not more than 30 days. However, even if Lucid Imagination deletes such personal information from its 'live' database, it may still be stored on other databases (including those kept for archival purposes).

## Part IV. Data Storage and Security

Lucid Imagination uses industry-standard methods of securing its electronic databases of personal information. Except as provided elsewhere in this privacy policy, Lucid Imagination limits access to personal information in electronic databases to those persons in Lucid Imagination's organization who have a business need for such access. However, you should know that no Lucid Imagination, including Lucid Imagination, can fully eliminate security risks associated with personal information.

Your privacy is very important to us. Due to factors beyond our control, however, we cannot fully ensure that your personal information will not be disclosed to third parties other than those mentioned above. For example, we may be legally required to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.

## Part V. Modifications

We may amend this privacy policy at any time by posting the amended version on our web sites.

## Part VI. Contact Information

If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy, please contact support. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve disputes within 90 days.
