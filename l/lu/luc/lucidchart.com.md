## Personal Information

  * Account activity. You need a Lucid Account to create diagrams in Lucidchart. Lucid asks for some personal information when you create a Lucid Account, including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access. Lucid's servers automatically record certain information about your use of Lucidchart. Similar to other web services, Lucid records information such as account activity (e.g., storage usage, number of log-ins, actions taken), data displayed or clicked on (e.g., UI elements, links), and other log information (e.g., browser type, IP address, date and time of access, cookie ID, referrer URL, etc.). Lucidchart may collect automated error reports in the case of software malfunction; such error reports may contain some or all of the information in your documents and may be reviewed to help resolve problems with the Lucidchart software or service.
  * Content. Lucidchart stores, processes and maintains your files (as well as previous versions of your files), sharing lists, and other data related to your account in order to provide the service to you.



## Uses

  * We use this information internally to deliver the best possible service to you, such as improving the Lucidchart user interface and maintaining a consistent and reliable user experience.
  * Files you create, upload, or copy to Lucidchart may, if you choose, be read, copied, used and redistributed by people you know or, again if you choose, by people you do not know. Information you disclose using the chat function of Lucidchart may be read, copied, used and redistributed by people participating in the chat. Use care when including sensitive personal information in files you share or in chat sessions, such as social security numbers, financial account information, home addresses or phone numbers.
  * Some features may be provided by third parties (e.g. the Amazon Payments service provided by Amazon Payments, Inc.), who may receive and process your data. When you use one of these features, you may be sharing data with the third party, including allowing the third party to process your data. Access to your data by these third parties is not governed by this Privacy Policy.
  * Lucidchart reserves the right to review documents to help resolve problems with the Lucidchart software or service, or to ensure compliance with our Terms of Service.



## Information Sharing

  * We will not sell or rent your personal information to others, except to the extent necessary to fulfill any requests by you to share content through another website or partner.
  * Lucidchart only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Lucidchart in the following limited circumstances: 
    * We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.
    * We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Lucidchart, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.
  * We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who used a type of document, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually.
  * If Lucidchart becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.



## Data Security

  * Lucidchart will take reasonable measures to protect your personal information and your documents, both to ensure that your documents remain available to you, and that they remain unavailable to unauthorized persons.



## Changes to Privacy Policy

  * Lucidchart reserves the right to change or modify this Privacy Policy at any time, without prior notice, by posting the modified Privacy Policy on our website. Your continued use of the website or Lucidchart’s services indicates your acceptance of any revised Privacy Policy.
  * Lucidchart may provide you with notifications that include, without limitation, any changes that are made to this Privacy Policy or our services, by postings on our website or via email to a user.



## Your Choices

  * You may terminate your use of Lucidchart at any time.
