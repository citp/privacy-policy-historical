**What Information about Me is Collected and Stored?**  
When you visit our Web Site, make an on-site purchase, or place an order online or by phone with our Customer Care Department, we collect and store your personal information about you. For example, when you open an account or place an order, we collect and store some or all of the following information that you provide: name, billing address, shipping address, email address, telephone number, credit card number and expiration date, debit card number, bank account number, and payment history. This information is used to provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested, to process and ship orders, to send order and shipping confirmations and to provide customer service. This information also may be used to contact you about sales, special offers, surveys and new features of the Web Site, unless you have opted not to receive promotional communications in connection with this Web Site. **You always have the choice not to receive marketing information mailings or calls; you just need to let us know.**

We collect and store certain other information automatically whenever you interact with this Web Site. For example, Lucky Brand collects your IP address, browser information and reference site domain name every time you visit this Web Site. We also collect information regarding customer traffic patterns and site usage. This information is used to analyze and improve this Web Site and to provide our customers with a fulfilling shopping experience.

Also, like many Web Sites, we use  cookies , which are files stored on your computer's hard drive by your browser. A cookie may contain information, such as a unique user ID that Web sites use to track the pages of the sites you've visited. We use cookies but do not store personally identifiable information in the cookie. Cookies help us to identify account holders and to optimize their shopping experience. Cookies also allow us to hold selections in a shopping cart when a user leaves this Web Site without checking out. Cookies are not used on this Web Site to store your account information; this information is stored securely on this Web Site's server. When you log in at this Web Site with your username and password, we will assign you a secure session id. The server then passes your information to you through this secure session id. Also, we will use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of this Web Site. Cookies are also used to track the identity of the Web Site you visited immediately prior to visiting this Web Site; otherwise, we do not track information about your use of other Web Sites. Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. We recommend that you leave cookies  turned on  so that we can offer you a better shopping experience on this Web Site. If you turn off cookies, though, we will not be able to track your order to enable you to purchase from this Web Site. Nor will we be able to recognize you as a registered user, which allows you to access your account information.

We also may collect and store information about you that we receive from other publicly available sources, to enable us to update and correct the information contained in our database and to provide product recommendations and special offers that we think will interest you. We use the combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, and to communicate with you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Is Information Collected From Children?**  
We are concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet or the Web Site. We do not sell or ship any items ordered through this Web Site directly to anyone who we know to be under the age of 18, nor do we collect any personal information from anyone who we know to be under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, you should use this Web Site only with the involvement of a parent or guardian and should not submit any personal information to us.

**With Whom Do You Share Information?**  
We do not share with others, or sell or rent to others, any personal information that you provide to us through this Web Site or through our Customer Care Department, except with your consent or as described in this Privacy Policy.

We engage third parties to perform services in connection with the operation of our business. Examples of these services include payment processing and authorization, fraud protection and credit risk reduction, product customization, order fulfillment and shipping, Web Site evaluation, data analysis and, where applicable, data cleansing. We provide personal information to these third parties, but we authorize them to use this information only in connection with the services they perform. They have privacy policies that are consistent with our own and they are not authorized to use your personal information for their own marketing purposes.

We may release personal information if we believe in good faith that: i) the law or legal process requires it; ii) we have received a valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency; or iii) such release is necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Auspient and/or Lucky Brand, or any of our respective affiliates, business partners, customers or others.

We may share non-personal information with our marketing partners, advertisers and others from time to time. Examples of such non-personal information include the number of users who visited this Web Site during a specific time period or purchased a specific product through this Web Site. This information generally is shared in an aggregated form.

As with any business, it is possible that as our business develops, we might sell or buy online stores or other assets. In such transactions, information about customers often is among the transferred assets. Accordingly, in the unlikely event that Auspient or Lucky Brand, or substantially all of our respective assets, are acquired by a third party, such information may be one of the transferred assets (unless the information was collected under a previous Privacy Policy that did not permit such disclosure). Under such circumstances, Auspient or Lucky Brand, as the case may be, will to the extent commercially reasonable require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

**What Steps Are Taken To Keep Personal Information Secure?**

You must provide an appropriate email address and password in order to access account information. In order to help protect your personal information further, you should be careful about providing your password to others.
