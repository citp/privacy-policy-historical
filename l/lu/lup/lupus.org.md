Privacy Practices for Participants of our Household Goods Donation Program 

The LupusAmerica® Household Goods Donation Program has a supplemental privacy policy that includes the third-party contractors who administer and operate the program for the benefit of the Lupus Foundation of America. 

This privacy policy describes how your information is collected and used by the Lupus Foundation of America,  (“Charity”), and/or Charity’s agents, Apogee Retail, LLC, TVI, Inc. and DNK Management (“Agents”) (Charity and Agents are collectively referred to as “we” or “us”) when you use lupus.org, lupuspickup.org, lupuspickupmdva.org and LFApickupservice.org, and any other websites operated by us (the “Site”).  By visiting this Site or providing information to us through other interaction with us, you consent to our collection and use of your information, and to the terms and conditions outlined in this Privacy Policy.

What information do we collect? We collect personal information, such as first and last name, address, e-mail address and telephone number, that you choose to provide to us when you register on this Site. In addition to the information we collect directly from you, we may receive or collect some information automatically when you visit the Sites or engage with other online content.  For example, we may receive the IP address of the computer or other device you use to access the Sites, which may tell us general geographic location.  We may also monitor and track usage of our Sites, viewing and traffic patterns, user behavior and other similar information.  For more information on automatic collection of information from our Sites, see Use of Cookies, below.

How is information used? We use the personal information that you provide to us, as well as information that is automatically collected, in aggregate, to request donations to the Charity, to notify you about our programs and services, for marketing and advertising purposes, and for internal business and administrative purposes, including to improve our Sites, our operations and our customer service (the “Programs”).  We may use cookies and similar tools in combination with other information you provide to us to participate in interest-based or targeted advertising.  This means that you may see ads on the Sites or other parties' websites or receive emails from us based on the way you browse our Sites and other parties’ websites.  

Telephone Services.  When you provide your telephone number when registering on the Site, you consent to receive telephone calls from us, about the Programs, which may be sent by automated means.  If, at any time, you wish to stop receiving these telephone calls, simply ask the agent making the call to remove you from the call list.  

Email Services. When you provide us your email address when registering on the Site, you consent to receive email messages from us, about the Programs, at the email address you provided to us.  If, at any time, you wish to stop receiving email messages from us, follow the “unsubscribe” instructions in a recent email message.

Text Messaging Services. If you have provided a telephone number, you may be asked for your consent to receive limited text messages about the Services.  If you consent to receive such text messages, you may receive text messages on your mobile phone or other mobile device about our programs and services, which may be sent by automated means. Message and data rates may apply. This means that your carrier may charge you for each message we send to you or that you send to us. It is your responsibility to know whether your carrier will charge you a per-message fee. We do not charge a fee for our text message programs and assume no responsibility for charges by your carrier you may incur when you sign up to receive text messages from us. You may opt out of a text message program at any time by following the instructions linked in the text message. You will receive a final confirmation message that will confirm that you will no longer receive text messages from the applicable text message program unless you opt back into such program.

Use of Cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that are stored on your computer and are used for record keeping purposes. We use cookies or similar technologies to make visiting and using our Sites easier. Cookies can help us see which parts of our Sites are the most or least popular and provide us direction to improve our customer's online experience. We may also use them to help us provide you with a customized experience and interest-based or targeted ads and promotions, as described above.  You may stop or limit our ability to collect information from you when you visit our Sites by disabling “cookies” or using other privacy features that may be available on your website browser.

Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services. At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for recognizable DNT signals and therefore, we do not recognize DNT.

Use by Third Parties. We do not sell your personally identifiable information to third parties. We do utilize the services of trusted third-party providers to assist us with contacting you through direct communication methods and through marketing and advertising, which may require us to share your personally identifiable information to those third-party providers. We use, and we require our third-party providers to use, industry-standard security techniques at the Sites to help protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information we collect.

For more information.  If you have any further questions regarding our privacy practices, please email us at info@lupus.org.

Your submission to the Health Educator may include health information, such as diagnosis information.  In addition, when responding to your inquiry we may ask for additional health information to better respond to your request.

**Contact Information**

The Registry asks for your contact information including your e-mail, mailing address and phone number in order to contact you about studies that may be of interest to you or to the individual you are registering.

The Registry contains several questions about your health and quality of life. This information is considered health information. We also ask questions about your date of birth and other demographics. The information allows us to better focus our programs and services to your needs as well as to identify study opportunities for which you may be a match.

**Informed Consent**

To enroll in the Registry, you will be asked to complete an Informed Consent form, which includes your electronic signature.  This form will provide information on the Registry, and any risks of participation. Additional Informed Consent forms may be required to participate in specific research studies.

**How We Use and Disclose Information Provided to the Registry**

Information submitted through the Registry is subject to the requirements set forth by a third-party Institutional Review Board and any informed consents to which you agree.

  * We may disclose your contact information to another organization conducting a study or survey that collects information similar to what you have previously provided to the Registry. In those cases, they may ask for your permission to receive specific data points from the Registry. If you agree to this, we will disclose only those data points. If you do not give your permission, we will not disclose that information.



**How to Unsubscribe from the Registry**

**Information You Provide:**

**Contact Information**

The Lupus Interest Group registration process asks for your contact information including your e-mail, mailing address and phone number in order to contact you about studies that may be of interest to you or to the individual you are enrolling. Registering for the Interest Group does NOT sign you up to receive other types of communications from us.

**Demographic and Health Information**

The Interest Group enrollment will ask for fewer details about your health and quality of life than the Registry enrollment. Instead, you will answer a few general questions about your diagnosis process and demographics. This information is collected in order to better communicate to you about our programs, services and informal studies that meet your specific needs.

**How We Use and Disclose Information Provided to the Interest Group**

Only members of our Data Management Team and other personnel with a need to know have access to the identifiable information described above. Your information may be disclosed in aggregate (summary) form in a way that does not contain identifiable information.

This information allows us to recognize you and personalize your experience if you return to the Site, and to improve the Site and the services we provide.  We and our service providers may collect this information using “cookies,” which are small text files that the Site saves on your computer using your web browser and accesses when you return, or similar technologies.

**Cookies**

A “cookie” is a small file placed on your computer to allow a website to recognize your computer on return visits. Like most websites, we use cookies to manage certain website features and to provide localized information. These cookies do not contain information typically used to identify you, but they may contain demographic (such as language preference) or interest-based information.  Other technologies are used for similar purposes as a cookie on other platforms where cookies are not available or applicable, such as the Advertising ID available on Android mobile devices. Most web browsers give you options for preventing, accepting, or receiving notice of new cookies.  If you reject cookies, you may still use our Site, however, some Site features may be lost or not function properly.

Many consider the use of cookies for these purposes to be an industry standard. Consequently, your web browser is likely set to accept cookies or allow other identifiers. There are several options for opting out of cookies and other tracking technologies, which include but are not limited to setting your web browser to private or incognito mode, opting out of the collection of data on your web and application activity through your mobile device or desktop computer.

Please note that if you delete, reject, or otherwise prohibit cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.

**Information Collected by Third Parties**

We use third party tools and services such as Google Analytics and AdWords that may deploy cookies, pixel tags, or similar tracking technologies to collect, analyze and report on Site activity and evaluate marketing campaign performance. A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking activity on websites, and all of the information resources provided through them.

**Statistical Data**

We collect information such as the total number of visitors, the date, time, length and frequency of visits, the average length of time and total number of times that visitors view each page, the device and software used to access our websites, how visitors arrived at our Site, and the domain name and locations of visitors' internet service providers.   We also compile lists of the keywords and search terms that visitors used to find information published on our Site, and the websites or search engines that referred visitors to our websites.

**Geolocation Data**

When you access and use the Site, we may receive, store and process different types of information about your geographic location, including general information (e.g., zip code) and more specific information (e.g., GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the Sites).
