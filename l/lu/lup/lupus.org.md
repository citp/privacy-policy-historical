# LUPUS FOUNDATION OF AMERICA

## Privacy

The Lupus Foundation of America is committed to protecting the privacy of its visitors. Information gathered through the LFA Website is used to monitor our site's effectiveness and to respond to your questions and requests. 

**What information do we collect and how do we use it?**

Through this Website we collect information about the domain name (.com, .net, .edu, .gov) of a visitor's server (i.e., the name of the Internet service provider's computer that funnels traffic to the Internet) but use it only for measurement purposes. These measurements provide web site statistics, such as the number of visitors, "hits", and top pages transmitted. Knowing how the site is used, helps us develop plans for improvement of the site. The data we collect are totals of those visiting from a domain and not information on individual visitors. 

We do not automatically collect email addresses or other personal information unless you provide it on a form, survey or email message. The information we collect is used in the following ways: 

The Lupus Foundation of America does not sell, trade, or rent personal information about its Website visitors, except as noted below. You may request to have your name removed from these mailing lists. Please email us at [info@lupus.org](mailto:info@lupus.org) and provide your full name, mailing address, and a sentence requesting deletion of your email address and/or postal information from our files. 

Email addresses provided to us through the "E-advocates," "Mailing List," “LFA Store,” or when making a donation, are used to distribute advocacy alerts, electronic newsletters, and announcements or other communications that LFA distributes on behalf of other organizations or partners. In these cases, the visitor will have the opportunity to "unsubscribe" or request removal from future email advocacy or update mailing lists. 

When you order products or services from the "LFA Store" or make a donation online, we need to know your name, email address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process, fulfill, and acknowledge your order or donation. Secure server software encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. 

The LFA periodically exchanges only the names and mailing addresses of our donors, subscribers, and store customers with other organizations. We do not provide information about the amount donated or its purpose, or the products or publications that you purchased from us or one of our cause-related marketing partners. You may request that we not sell or exchange your name and mailing information by sending an email message to [info@lupus.org ](mailto:info@lupus.org)that includes your full name, mailing address and a request that we not exchange your information with other organizations. 

You may receive periodic mailings from the Lupus Foundation of America via the U.S. mail. If you do not wish to receive such mailings please provide your full name, mailing address, and a sentence requesting deletion of your postal information from our files, and email it to [info@lupus.org](mailto:info@lupus.org), or you can write to us at LFA, 2000 L Street, N.W., Suite 710, Washington , DC 20036 - USA. 

When you use the "Email This Article to A Friend" function available in the articles posted on the LFA Home page, your email address is used only to let the recipient know who sent the link to the article, and in case of a transmission error. Your address and the recipient's address is not recorded and will not be used for any other purpose. 

By using the Lupus Foundation of America Website, you consent to the collection and use of the information described above. Any changes to this policy will be posted.
