### Privacy Policy

Aabaco Small Business, LLC is now part of the [Verizon family of companies](http://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/). The way we handle your information hasn't changed, so the Company's Privacy Policy still governs when you are on our site, or interacting with our products, services or technologies. We may share non-personal information with our family companies for purposes such as product improvements, research and analysis, and to help them provide you with more relevant experiences. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat your information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your Aabaco account or by placing a prominent notice on our site. If you are a merchant doing business with customers in the European Economic Area, you may have an obligation to comply with data protection laws beyond what is provided in this privacy policy, including a requirement to obtain consents for the processing of personal data, and these consents should include approval for the Company to process your customers’ personal data. 

The Yahoo Small Business services and products (the "Services") are provided by Aabaco Small Business, LLC and its subsidiaries (the "Company") primarily to help fuel the growth and success of businesses on the Internet.

  


### COVERED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY

This policy applies only to the Company and covers how we treat the Personal Information we collect through interaction with our sites, apps, products, and services. Personal Information is information about You that identifies You or your device personally, like Your full name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available, but is not business contact information. The Company’s sites, products and services may not be used by children under the age of 13.

Personal Information collected by the Services is shared with Oath. Oath's [Privacy Policy](https://policies.oath.com/us/en/oath/privacy/index.html) governs its use of that information.

 **NOT COVERED:**

  * This policy does not override any elements of the terms directly established with the Company's customers or partners, including the [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/tos). Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/tos).
  * The Company’s customers operate their own businesses, with their own websites, with or without the technical assistance of the Company, and all of their data collection and use is governed by their own privacy policies.
  * This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that the Company does not own or control, or to people that the Company does not employ or manage.

  


### INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

The Company collects Personal Information when You register with the Company; when You interact with the Company's sites, apps, products, development tools, marketing programs, or services, and pages of the Company's customers and some partners; when You sign-up for a newsletter or when You enter a promotion or sweepstakes. The Company may combine information about You that we have with information we obtain from customers or partners, publicly available information, or other companies.

When You register or provide additional account information we may ask for information such as Your full name, company name, email address, birth date, gender, phone number, mobile phone number, address, credit card number, business type, industry, and other details. When You register with the Company and use our sites, products, or services, You are not anonymous to us.

The Company collects information about Your transactions with us, our customers, and with some of our partners, including information about Your use of products and services that we offer.

The Company automatically receives and records information from Your computer and browser, including Your IP Address, the Company's cookies and other device information, software and hardware attributes, and the page You requested.

The Company uses information for the following general purposes: to customize Your experiences, content, and advertising with us, our customers and some of our partners; fulfill Your requests for products and services; improve our services; provide recommendations; contact You; conduct research; and provide reporting for our customers, internal purposes and partners.

When you register and provide your contact information, You will be given the option to consent to receive marketing calls, text messages, and emails from the Company and others calling, texting, or emailing on its behalf, including but not limited to, calls and text messages made with an autodialer or prerecorded voice, at the telephone number(s) that You provide. Such calls, text messages, and emails may include, for example, marketing messages, password reminders, authentication messages, account- or service-related alerts and reminders, customer service communications, satisfaction surveys, and other types of calls and text messages. You may not opt-out of receiving these communications for purposes of communications regarding Your account, Services, and the security of Your account. You may change your preferences by signing in to Your account and going to Your "Profile."

Your Personal Information may be transferred outside of the country in which You reside for processing and storage. As a result it could be subject to access by government agencies in those countries.

  


### INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

The Company does not rent, sell, or share Personal Information about You with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services You've requested, when we have Your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  *  **Service Providers, Contractors, and Agents:** We provide information to partners who work on behalf of or with the Company under confidentiality agreements. These companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
  *  **Co-Branded Partners:** The Company may provide some services in partnership with others under a co-branded experience. In these situations both companies may be collecting information about You so please see the privacy links available within the experience to learn more. For example, Business Mail is provided in partnership with [Oath](https://policies.oath.com/us/en/oath/privacy/index.html).
  *  **Legal Process:** We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
  *  **Security & Fraud:** We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/tos), or as otherwise required by law.
  *  **Merger & Acquisition:** We transfer information about You if the Company is acquired by or merged with another company.

  


### PARTNERS

The Company enters partnerships with third parties to provide or augment some of its sites, products, and services. In some cases, these partners may collect information about Your interaction with that page, product, or service subject to their own privacy policies. The Company may display targeted advertisements based on Your Personal Information or partner with companies who provide similar services. Advertisers (including the companies assisting them in the delivery of an ad) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.
