Hola Networks Limited ("Hola", "we" or "us") is the owner of the website
hola.org (the "Site"), the Hola software ("the Software") and any accompanying
services, features, content and applications offered by us (collectively
referred herein as the "Services"). We are concerned about your privacy and
have designed this Privacy Policy in order to help you decide whether to use
the Services.<br>
<br>
This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you ("you" or "user") and
us. By accessing and using the Services, or providing information to us in
other formats, you agree and accept the terms of this Privacy Policy as amended
from time to time and consent to the collection and use of information in the
manner set out in this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy
Policy carefully and to periodically refer to it so that you understand it and
its subsequent changes if any.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS
PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE STOP USING THE SERVICES IMMEDIATELY AND WHERE RELEVANT
UNINSTALL.<br>
<br>
The definitions in the Hola <a href="/legal/sla">End User License Agreement</a>

PLEASE REVIEW OUR END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY
REFERENCE, TOGETHER WITH SUCH OTHER POLICIES OF WHICH YOU MAY BE NOTIFIED OF BY
US FROM TIME TO TIME.<br>
<br>

<h3>The Information We Collect</h3>
When you use the Services we collect the following types of data from you:
<ul class="spaced_list">
  <li>
    <b>Anonymous Information;</b> We collect Anonymous Information about your
    use of the Services to allow us to provide the Services and constantly
    improve them, for security reasons and so that we can audit and track usage
    statistically, audit our affiliates and calculate payments to 3rd parties.
    Such Anonymous Information does not enable identification of individual
    persons, and it includes your approximate geo-location, hardware
    specifications, browser type and version, the date of the Software
    installation, the date of your last use of the Services, your operating
    system type, version and language, registry entries, your URL requests and
    respective time stamps.We do not make any efforts to reveal your identity
    through this information. We may also collect information that will help us
    understand whether your device is used at a given moment so we will not
    send it any requests.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Personal Information;</b> is information that may be of a private or
    sensitive nature, identifies or may identify you. The Personal Information
    we collect and retain include your IP address, your name and email address
    in case you provide us with this information (for instance when you open an
    account or if you approach us through the "contact us" option), screen
    name, payment and billing information (if you purchase premium services) or
    other information we may ask from time to time as will be required for the
    Services provisioning. When you create an account on the Services you are
    able to do so by using your credentials with a designated third party
    website or service ("Third Party Account"), such as Facebook®. Doing so
    will enable you to link your account and your Third Party Account. If you
    choose this option, then a Third Party Account pop-up box will appear which
    you will need to approve in order to proceed, and which will describe the
    types of information that we will obtain from. Such information includes
    your Personal Information stored on this Third Party Account, such as user
    name, email address, profile picture, birthday, gender and preferences.  We
    also treat any Anonymous Information which is specifically connected or
    linked to any Personal Information, as long as such connection or linkage
    exists, as Personal Information.
  </li>
  <li>

    browsing acceleration, information which is publicly accessible by other
    users that you have accessed may be accessed by those users from cached
    copy of this data from your device; Please note that when you interact with
    other websites and use Hola, such websites may collect information about
    you. Hola has nothing to do with such website's data collection practices
    and such practices will be governed by their own privacy policies.

internal procedures and strict guidelines to prevent information misuse and
data leakage. Our employees and contractors access the information on a
"need-to-know" basis and subject to confidentiality obligations.<br>

data misuse, but we cannot guarantee that our systems will be absolutely safe.
