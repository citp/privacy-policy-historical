**What we do with information collected**  


Lumenis is the sole owner of the information collected at our site. We do not sell or rent information to third parties or partners. The information collected at our site is used exclusively to determine the most appropriate information to send to those who request it. 

Lumenis will protect your personal information by using appropriate security safeguards. We restrict access to information to persons who need to know the information to provide products or services to you. 

We obtain personal information about you in order to service your business and enhance our services. Such information is collected using Contact Us forms, Workshop and Conference Registration forms, Newsletter and Update Registration forms, data from either a Lumenis cookie or a cookie from a Lumenis service provider, or other communications that you send or provide to us. These mechanisms allow you to ask specific questions of Lumenis or offer feedback, comments or suggestions about the product described therein. The information submitted enables Lumenis to respond to your inquiries, as appropriate, and obtain a measure of users' needs, interests and ideas for future website development and product interest. Lumenis limits the collection of personal information to that which is necessary for the purposes of providing the products and services you have requested and conducting our business efficiently. 

Personal information is retained and disclosed as necessary to serve our customers and otherwise only in accordance with applicable law. Personal information about our customers or former customers is not used or disclosed to any third parties except:  


* As required in rendering the services that you have requested. 
* As required by subpoena or law (as to tax authorities or regulators). 
* As may be appropriate to protect against fraud or illegal activity, for the safety of customers, employees, or property, or is otherwise permitted by law. 
* If you elect to disclose, or specifically direct us to disclose for you, personal information to a third party (as in the case where you request a product or service from a third party after receiving information or a link from Lumenis). 

Lumenis may also gather anonymous information, which may be used by Lumenis or shared with third parties. This information does not personally identify you but may be helpful for improving the services we offer. Generally this information is collected through "traffic data" and may entail the use of "cookies", "IP addresses", or other numeric codes used to identify a computer. 

Lumenis uses email and direct mail as a way of keeping you up-to-date about our product and service innovations and offers that may be of interest to our customers (e.g., new features, products or other information). These communications may also offer special incentives that we hope will prompt you to try something new at Lumenis. Nonetheless, Lumenis maintains a practice of permitting persons to be excluded from such communications, such as straightforward opt-out options. 

We will strive to keep personal information as accurate, complete, and up-to-date as is necessary for its intended purpose. 

All e-mail sent by Lumenis will contain clear and concise instructions (such as clicking on the link at the bottom of an e-mail) for how to opt-out of receiving future communications. Upon request, we provide site visitors with access to all information that we maintain about them. Visitors have the ability to correct their contact information or update their profiles by sending an e-mail to [Lumenis](mailto:information@Lumenis.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy), sending your updates via postal mail (see bottom of this page), or calling us at (408) 764-3000.
