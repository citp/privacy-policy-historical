We do not publish or in anyway make our statistics public. We may, on occasion list how many visitors or hits our site has handled in a given time period, but no specific information on individual IP addresses is released.

 **What Rights You Have Over Your Data:**

If you are a registered user or have left comments on our site you can request to see or download the data we have about you. As LC-Tech.com does not take comments, or have registered users, we would not have information of this sort for a visitor to download. The only information we would have would be the information supplied from filling out a software evaluation request form, a support request form, or a contact form.

Typically for visitors that have filled out a form, the data will be their email address, any IP addresses assigned to them at the time of filling out a form and the user agent strings of the browsers they used. The rest of the data is public as published by the visitors.

For paying customers, this will also include profile information and download, payment, and support ticket histories.

You can also request “to be forgotten” and we will erase any personally identifiable data we have about you. Of course, this excludes data we need for administrative or security purposes or if we are required by law to retain some of the data. For the present time period, this applies to our visitors from the European Union, in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We will amend this further in the near future.

An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, should direct his/her query to [support@lc-tech.com](mailto:support@lc-tech.com). We will respond within a reasonable timeframe, not to exceed one week. For the present time period, this applies to our visitors from the European Union, in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We will amend this further in the near future.

 **What Data Breach Procedures We Have In Place:**

Should any event occur where customer data has been lost, stolen, or potentially compromised, our policy is to alert our customers via email no later than 48 hours of our team becomes aware of the event. We will also report such incident to any required data protection authority.
