We may however appoint third parties to store and process your information on our behalf.

Protecting your privacy is very important to us. This Privacy Policy explains our data processing practices and your options regarding the ways in which your personal data is used. If you have any requests concerning your personal information or any queries with regard to how we process your information please contact us using the details below.

 **1\. What information do we collect about you?**

At various times during a visit to this Website you may be asked to provide us with personal information (for example your name and contact details). This may be in connection with activities such as registration for newsletters, operation of our subscription services, social sharing, competitions and activity for our partners.

In common with many other online services we may also use "cookies" to collect information about how you use the Website. This information is used to produce statistical reports on website activity and allows us to tailor the Website to suit your interests. Examples include:

  * enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task
  * recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested
  * measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are delivered quickly to your web browser

**2\. How will we use your personal information?**

Primarily we will use the personal information we collect about you to send you information you have requested, create a membership profile for you (allowing us to provide a personalised service when you visit the Website), assist in the provision of products and services to you and to enable us to review and improve the products or services offered to you.

From time to time we would also like to contact you to let you know about products and services offered by us, our clubs, their official partners and other carefully selected third parties that may be of interest to you. We may also provide your details to carefully selected third parties in order for them to contact you directly about their products and services. By ticking the applicable boxes in the Privacy Notice you are deemed to agree to the use of your information for these purposes.

 **3\. What are my choices?**

You have a right to stop us from contacting you for marketing purposes or giving your information to third parties. If you no longer wish to be contacted for marketing purposes please click on the "unsubscribe" URL link that is present on the bottom of your club website.

Customers who have opted out of receiving marketing communications will still receive payment and account related emails.

You are also entitled to request a copy of the information that we hold about you. If you would like to do this please contact us using the details below. You may be required to pay a small fee for this service.

We want to make sure that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and up to date. You may ask us to correct or remove information you think is inaccurate.

 **4\. When does this Privacy Policy not apply?**

This Privacy Policy only applies to the collection of personal information by us and those whom we authorise. It does not cover third party sites to which we provide links, nor does it cover advertisers and content partners within our service who may also collect your personal information. If you link to third party websites from this Website you should read their privacy policies and terms of use carefully.

If you place personal details on any publicly accessible page (for example on a message board) then this data will not be covered by our Privacy Policy.

 **5\. How do we protect your information?**

We are firmly committed to data security. The personal information you provide to us is encrypted before it is sent to us and once it is received we store it on secure servers. We take steps to guard against unauthorised access to your personal information and to ensure it is treated in accordance with our Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, although we make every effort to create a secure environment for your personal information we cannot guarantee the safety of any personal information which you transmit to us online.

The personal information we collect may be transferred to and/or stored or processed at a location outside the European Economic Area.
