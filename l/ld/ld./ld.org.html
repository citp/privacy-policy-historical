                    who access our sites. We use this information to helps us 
                    to provide you with important, relevant and timely information. 
                    NCLD does not share this information with third parties. We 
                    also utilitize e-mails collected via the sites to provide 
                    you with newsletters, advocacy and fundraising information. 
                    You will receive an e-mail confirming that you wish to receive 
                    this information. Should you not wish to receive it, do not 
                    respond to the e-mail.</p>
                  <p class="bodytext"><b>Registration </b><br>
                    Visitors are asked to provide certain personal information 
                    when they join our community or subscribe to our newsletter(s), 
                    such as name, address, telephone number, and e-mail. The information 
                    collected from visitors during the registration process is 
                    used to help NCLD develop better content for the Web sites, 
                    collect audience information and to develop our Web community, 
                    particularly for advocacy and fundraising purposes. This information 
                    is not shared with third parties.</p>
                  <p class="bodytext"><b>Online Shopping </b><br>
                    At some Web sites linked to our sites, you can purchase products 
                    and services or register to receive materials, such as a catalog 
                    or new product and service updates. In many cases, you may 
                    be asked to provide contact information, such as your name, 
                    address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card 
                    information. If you complete an order for someone else, such 
                    as an online gift order sent directly to a recipient, you 
                    may be asked to provide information about the recipient, such 
                    as the recipient's name, address, and phone number. NCLD has 
                    no control over the third parties' use of any personal information 
                    you provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care

                  <p class="bodytext"><b>Responses to Email Inquiries </b><br>
                    When visitors send email inquiries to our sites, they will 
                    receive an automatic response and an e-mail allowing them 
                    to sign up for our newsletters and other e-bulletins. Due 
                    to the heavy volume of inquiries, it is not possible for NCLD 
                    to respond to every individual e-mail. Visitors are encouraged 
                    to browse the site for answers to their questions, and the 
                    auto response explains and links to specific site sections. 
                    There is also an additional e-mail contact, in case the automatic 
                    response and Web guidance does not provide the needed information. 
                    NCLD does not use the return email address for any other purpose 
                    and does not share the return email address with any third 
                    party. </p>

                  <p class="bodytext"><b>Voluntary Customer Surveys </b><br>
                    We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer 
                    surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these 
                    surveys because they provide us with important information 
                    that helps us to improve the types of services, programs and 
                    content we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal 
                    information and responses will remain strictly confidential, 
                    even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation 
                    in our customer surveys is voluntary. We take the information 
                    we receive from individuals responding to our surveys and 
                    combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other visitors 
                    to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions 
                    (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, 
                    industry sector, or other demographic information). We then 
                    use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our 
                    services and information to you, and to develop new services

                    Protecting children's privacy is especially important to us. 
                    We have Web pages designed especially for our younger users. 
                    While we make every effort to ensure that these Web sites 
                    are fun and age-appropriate for our younger audience, we believe 
                    that there is no substitute for proper parental supervision.

                    Finally, NCLD recommends that children ask a parent for permission 
                    before sending personal information to NCLD or to anyone else 
                    online.</p>
