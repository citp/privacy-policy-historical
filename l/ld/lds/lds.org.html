<p> LDS.ORG is the main Web
            site of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
            (“Church”). We are very sensitive to the privacy of Internet
            users who visit this site. Therefore, we endeavor to provide
            users all information regarding our identity, how we use
            personal information that is collected, how to contact us,
            and how they can access and update their personal
            information. We also inform users of all potential
            recipients of the personal information. We do not use any
            personal information for purposes beyond those stated
            herein. </p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p>
            <strong>Our Identity and How to Contact Us</strong>
        </p>
<p> This site is owned and
            operated by Corporation of the President of The Church of
            Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Users can contact us by
            linking to the Feedback page and leaving a message detailing
            any questions or concerns. </p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p>
            <strong>Personal Information: Collection and Use</strong>
        </p>
<p>
            <strong>Personal Data.</strong> LDS.ORG collects information from
            users only on a voluntary basis in the following categories
            and never discloses the information except as provided
            herein: name, mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail
            address. Information is provided voluntarily by users and is
            used by the Church only to the extent necessary to deliver
            items ordered from Church Distribution, to subscribe to
            Church publications, to subscribe to summaries of current
            Church news stories, to submit information regarding news or
            events, or to provide feedback regarding the site. The
            information collected is used strictly to facilitate users'
            requests or to respond to a query. We regard this
            information as confidential and do not use it for any other
            purpose, sell it to other parties, or disclose it to any
            third party (except to third-party delivery services to
            effectuate delivery of the goods as requested by the user).
            Users can correct their personal information by clicking on
            the Update My Profile icon for Church Distribution orders.
            If any problems are encountered in removing or modifying
            personal information or if any other request to update
            personal information has been submitted, users can contact
            us at the Feedback page and request assistance. </p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p>
            <strong>Third-Party Data</strong>. Users may also submit personal
            information of third parties, including their names,
            addresses, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers. This
            information is used to allow Church representatives to make
            contact with the named individual to determine interest in
            hearing the message of the gospel, and for no other purpose.
            Users can also provide the same information regarding third
            parties to order items or subscriptions for the third party.
            The information collected is used strictly to facilitate the
            users' requests for delivery of the item to the third party
            or to simplify the process of future orders or subscription
            renewals to the same third party, and for no other purpose. </p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p>
            <strong>Local Ward, Stake, and Leadership Data</strong>. LDS.ORG has
            established ward and stake Web sites containing some
            additional information on members. In order to access member
            or leader information in these Web sites, the user must be a
            member of the Church and register by providing his or her
            membership record number and the date of confirmation as a
            member of the Church. This information is collected to limit
            and restrict who can access the ward and stake Web site, and
            for no other purpose. The member will also provide his or
            her name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address on
            his or her registration to use the ward or stake Web site.
            This information is used strictly to facilitate the user’s
            request or to respond to a question, and for no other
            purpose. Access to the ward and stake Web site is allowed
            only for non-commercial, general Church functions, and all
            members have the option of having their personal information
            left off the local Web sites. </p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p>
            <strong>Site Activities: Collection and Use of Other Data</strong>
        </p>
<p> The Church has
            contracted with a third-party service provider to help track
            and analyze usage and volume statistics on this site. The
            third-party service provider does not collect personal
            information from site visitors, only general summaries of
            site activities. This information is used only to improve
            the site’s quality. This third-party service uses cookies
            and clear gifs (as explained below), neither of which
            contain personally identifiable information, to help in
            tracking and analyzing site usage information. </p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p>
            <strong>Cookies and Clear Gifs.</strong> In our effort to improve
            users’ site experience, the site uses cookies and clear gifs
            to provide pages and features that are most compatible with
            users’ preferences. A cookie is a small text file that is
            stored on a browser when a user visits a Web site. A clear
            gif is a graphic file, rather than a text file, that is
            similar in function to a cookie. Cookies and clear gifs do
            not identify the user personally; they simply identify the
            browser and track the settings, preferences, or features.
            When a user returns to the site, the user’s browser sends
            the cookie or clear gif to the Church’s Web server and/or
            the third party’s server. </p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p>
            <strong>Internet Protocol (“IP”) Addresses.</strong> When users
            request pages from LDS.ORG, our servers may log their IP
            address in order to improve site administration. This
            information, along with the other information listed above,
            can also be used to produce usage statistics to help LDS.ORG
            to better meet the needs of users and determine specific
            interests. </p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p>
            <strong>Protecting Information</strong>
        </p>
<p> LDS.ORG is equipped
            with security measures to protect against the loss, misuse,
            and unauthorized alteration of the information under our
            control. We cannot guarantee that the information will not
            be lost or misused, but we make every effort to ensure that
            it is secured to avoid such problems. </p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p>
            <strong>Foreign Transfer of Data</strong>
        </p>
<p> This site is designed
            for use by U.S. residents. If you are not a U.S. resident,
            you can use this site, but you are responsible for making
            sure that your actions comply with the laws in your area.
            When you submit information through this Web site, we
            understand that your action is an affirmative act,
            indicating informed consent to the processing as well as
            informed consent to allow the transborder transfer of the
            data to the U.S. for the purposes outlined above. If you
            submit any personal information about yourself or others,
            including information inferring or demonstrating religious
            beliefs, affiliations, or practices, you alone are
            responsible for the consequences of making this transfer of
            personal information. </p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p>
            <strong>Children's Privacy</strong>
        </p>
<p> We do not knowingly
            collect information from children under 13. Children under
            13 wishing to submit personal information to the site are
            advised to have their parents submit any requests using the
            parents' own personal data. </p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p>
            <strong>Third-Party Links</strong>
        </p>
<p> LDS.ORG is not
            responsible for the privacy practices or content of any
            third-party sites. For your own protection, you should
            review the policies of similar sites to ensure they meet
            your personal expectations of privacy. </p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p>
            <strong>Future Changes to Privacy Policy</strong>
        </p>
<p> We reserve the right,
            at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove
            portions of the Privacy Policy at any time. As we do not
            typically use personal information except as provided for
            above, we are not in a position to notify each user of
            material changes in our Privacy Policy. We encourage you to
            check the Privacy Policy to remain informed of any changes. </p>
<p> &nbsp; </p>
<p>
            <strong>Effective Date</strong>
        </p>
<p> This version of the
            Privacy Policy became effective on the 15th day of November,
            2004. </p>
