Your IP Address

Each time you visit the Site, we automatically collect your IP address and the web page from which you came.

Your IP address is used to help identify you, collect broad demographic information and to verify and track your session. This gives LdsSingles.com an idea of which parts of our site anonymous users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable.

Cookies are used to manage your sessions on the Site. You may modify these settings through your account. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser.
