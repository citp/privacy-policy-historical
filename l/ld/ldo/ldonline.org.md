# LD Online Privacy Policy

### **LD OnLine's Privacy Policy**

  
LD OnLine is committed to protecting your privacy. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we want you to fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the use of the information we collect. All information we collect is confidential. We do not sell or share the data with any other organizations.   
Please review the following information to understand how the information you provide will be treated. 

**1\. Information LD OnLine collects:**

The information gathered by LD OnLine falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to LD OnLine and (2) tracking information routinely gathered as visitors navigate through our site. 

**2\. Voluntarily-Supplied Information:**

You are free to visit LD OnLine.org without identifying yourself. However, if you send us questions using the ASK LD OnLine, Ask Dr. Silver, or Dialogue with Dale buttons or subscribe to our monthly newsletter you will need to provide your email address so that a response can be forwarded to you. LD OnLine does not collect any personally-identifying information unless you choose to provide that information to us.

The areas of the site in which we collect information, the information collected and the purpose for collecting that information are described below:

> **_a. Subscription to electronic newsletters:_** LD OnLine offers a free electronic newsletter to users. This newsletter includes highlights of the LD OnLine web site content, and other news of interest to LD OnLine users. To subscribe, you must provide your email address. To remove yourself from the mailing list, follow the instructions at the bottom of any newsletter.
> 
> **_b. Posting to bulletin boards or using online surveys:_** To use LD OnLine's bulletin boards you must register with a unique username. This username and posts made under that username are not correlated to any personally-identifying information collected elsewhere in the site.
> 
> **_c. Sending feedback to LD OnLine through the "Ask LD OnLine" and "Contact Us" page._** To send email to LD OnLine using the "Ask LD OnLine" button or the "Contact Us", you must enter a name and email address, and of course, your comments. In addition, you have the option of entering a city and state. This information is used to respond to your comments, and in aggregate form for statistical purposes.  
>  Visitors under the age of 18 must obtain permission from their parents or guardians before sending any personally-identifying information to LD OnLine.

**3\. Tracking Information:**

LD OnLine's Web server gathers information about all users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services users access most often. LD OnLine automatically logs IP addresses, sessions sources, and other data which tracks users' access to LD OnLine. We analyze these logs for funding purposes as well as system performance monitoring. These logs are analyzed for the overall aggregate trends they reveal about our readers, not for the behaviors of individual users. A listing of such data is provided below.

  * The Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) of the machine you used to access our Web site* 
  * The date and time you visited 
  * The pages you visited on our site 
  * The brand and version of browser you used, and the type of computer you used. 
  * A list of files you downloaded or viewed 
  * The amount of time you spent viewing or listening to streaming media files 
  * Any errors you encountered 



*Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data. Your IP address does not identify you personally. Most Internet Service Providers use a "dynamic" form of assigning IP Addresses. This means that you may have a different IP Address each time you visit LD OnLine. Also, many Internet Service Providers, including America Online, use "Proxy servers" which provide even more anonymity for visitors. For example, all visitors accessing LD OnLine through America Online will be recorded in our access logs as having the same IP Address.

**4\. Privacy of Children:**

LD OnLine's policy is to limit the collection of personal information from children. Before children under the age of 18 may participate in any services requiring registration (e.g., submissions for the KidZone, message boards or other forums), the child must first obtain the parent's permission. A permission form can be found at <http://www.ldonline.org/kidzone/weekly_winner.html>. If at any time after a parent gives permission, the parent desires to review the child's personal information, request that it be deleted or refuse to allow any further collection of the child's information, the parent may contact LD OnLine. Parents may also request the removal of any drawings or writings their child has submitted for publication on our site as well. 

LD OnLine does not:

  * collect more information from children than is reasonably necessary for them to participate in activities; 
  * entice children, by the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity, to provide more information than is necessary to participate in the activity; or 
  * share any personal information about children with third parties. 



**5\. About Cookies:**

To help make our sites more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we invoke a standard feature found in browser software, called a "cookie," to assign each visitor a unique, random number, a sort of anonymous user ID that resides on your computer. A cookie is a small data file. The cookie doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we won't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie can't read data off your hard drive, and our cookie can't read the cookie files created by other sites. Our sponsors may also assign their own cookies to your browser to track which ads you have viewed, a process that we don't control.

We use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs, to deliver a better, more personalized service. It is a cookie, for example, that allows you to post messages in the Bulletin Boards area without having to login and give your password every time you come back, even if you've been away for awhile. We may also use cookies to track the pages on our site visited by our users. We can build a better site if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often.

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies enabled to use LD OnLine. However, some features of our site will not work properly if you refuse cookies.

**6\. Information Sharing and Sites Beyond LD OnLine:**

To make our site more valuable to our visitors, we offer some features in conjunction with other providers. Features such as our Store, for example, are made available through an affiliate arrangement with Amazon.com. And, of course, our site includes links to a lot of other web sites whose privacy policies we do not control. Once you leave our server (you can tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should contact the site directly for more information.

**7\. Security:**

All of the information is stored on servers at a location designed specifically to ensure that no unauthorized individuals have access to the server or its data. 

**8\. LD OnLine Privacy Policy Changes:**

If LD OnLine changes this privacy statement, we will post the changes at <http://www.ldonline.org/privacychange.html> so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
