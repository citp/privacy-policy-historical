This policy applies to all the pages on the Site and any features of it and any e-commerce, purchasing or other areas which require registration.

This Site is hosted on servers in the EU and/or the US. Our Site contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or operation of other sites.

**How do we collect your Personal Information?**

We collect your information in two ways:

You may, for example, provide us with your information when you post something on the Site, when you register for any features on the Site that require registration, when you contact us or when you order goods or services from us. 

> 2\. Website use information collected by us as you interact with our Site. 

We use cookies (a small piece of computer code that we store for a period of time on your computer or mobile device) when you visit the Site. The cookie is sent to and stored on your computer containing a unique session identifier. This identifier is used to record site usage statistics. 

In a separate automatic operation the web server will collect your IP address and browser type and details of the Website where you came from before entering this Site. This information is used to:

  1. work out how many times this Site has been visited; and

The information collected is stored on your computer and will automatically be deleted if you do not revisit this Site for 90 days.  
We may also use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for you to log in on any areas that require log-in. You can disable this convenience feature. 

We may use cookies and similar tools to customise the content and advertising you receive based on any profile information you may provide and your usage of the Site. 

You can disable cookies in your web browser settings - in doing so you may experience some loss of functionality while browsing the Site, particularly related to the online shopping basket.

**Safety of your Personal Information on our Site**

We seek to protect the safety of your payment information against unauthorised access through a secure server provided your browser accepts Secure Sockets Layer encryption. Where we use third parties to process payment information, we require them to ensure the safety of your information. We use appropriate security measures on our own systems, but the Internet is not a secure medium and we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted via the internet. 

Any Personal Information that you voluntarily post on a public area of the Site, such as a bulletin board or discussion forum, or an interactive area requiring registration and/or subscription, may be collected and used by others. You understand that we cannot control the actions of other users. 

You agree not to misuse any Personal Information available on the Site or to gather it or use robots or other automated scripts, codes or functionalities to do so. 

We will never sell your Personal Information. We may disclose and share Personal Information with the following third parties.

We shall exchange Personal Information with:

  2. our service providers and those of our affiliated entities, including for example credit reference agencies and payment processors or our distributors/agents of our products;
