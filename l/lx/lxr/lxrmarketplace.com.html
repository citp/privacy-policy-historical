			<h3>LINKS</h3>

			<p>Please be aware that we may provide links to third party Web
				sites from our Sites as a service to our users and we are not
				responsible for the content or information collection practices of
				those sites. We have no ability to control the privacy and data
				collection practices of such sites and the privacy policies of such
				sites may differ from that of our sites. Therefore, we encourage you
				to review and understand the privacy policies of such sites before
				providing them with any information.</p>
			<br>

			<h3>COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS</h3>

			<p>
				We may use cookies to identify users and customize their experience
				on our site based on information they give us. Cookies are small
				pieces of information or files that are stored on a user's computer
				by the Web server through a user's browser for record keeping
				purposes. A cookie itself is not designed or intended to read any
				information from your computer (other than the contents of the
				cookie); rather, it is an identifier used by the Web site that
				originally placed it on your hard drive. The actual contents of the
				cookie information can be retrieved by the same site's Web server in
				order to personalize, monitor, or regulate the use of the site. We
				do not use Web <span class="GramE">beacons,</span> or similar
				technology on our Sites. However, we may from time to time permit
				third parties to place Web beacons on our Sites to monitor the
				effectiveness of advertising and for other lawful purposes. A Web
				beacon, also known as a "Web bug, " is a small, graphic image on a
				Web page, Web-based document or in an e-mail message that is
				designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor who is
				visiting a site. Web beacons collect non-personally identifying
				information such as the IP address of the computer that the Web
				beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from and
				the time it was viewed. We do not use (or permit third parties to
				use) Web beacons to collect personally identifying information about
				you.
			</p>
			<br>

			<p>
			</p><h3>SECURITY</h3>
			No method of safeguarding information is 100% secure. We use a
			variety of security measures, technologies and procedures to store
			and maintain personally identifying information to protect it from
			loss, misuse, alternation or destruction by any unauthorized party
			while it is under our control. When personal information (such as a
			credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected
			through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
			protocol.
			<p></p>
			<br>

			<p>
			</p><h3>CHILDREN</h3>
			<span class="GramE">We</span> do not intend, and these Sites are not
			designed, to collect personal information from children under the age
			of 16. If you are under 16 years old, you should not register for our
			services or otherwise provide information on our Sites.
			<p></p>
