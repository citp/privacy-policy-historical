                      <span class="body-text">LRN, The Legal Knowledge Company ("LRN") is committed to protecting your privacy and earning your trust. This Privacy Statement describes LRN's privacy practices for the services LRN provides through web sites which LRN creates, configures and hosts on behalf of its customers and for the web site located at <a href="http://www.lrn.com" class="body-more-link">http://www.lrn.com</a>. These practices conform to the requirements prescribed by the United States-European Union "Safe Harbor" arrangement for compliance by U.S.-based organizations with the provisions of the European Union's Directive regarding the protection of personal information. </span><br>
                      <br>
                      <span class="body-text-header">Information Collection &amp; Use</span><br>

                      <span class="body-text-emph">Customer Web Sites</span><br>
                      <span class="body-text">LRN provides online knowledge, training and other services to employees of LRN's customers and others designated by LRN's customers to participate in LRN's programs ("Users"). LRN's customers are typically businesses or other organizations. LRN typically provides its services via web sites that LRN creates, configures and hosts on behalf of the customer. LRN operates its programs and collects and uses data about Users at the direction of, and in accordance with, the instructions of LRN's customers. </span><p></p>
                  <p class="body-text">LRN's arrangements with its customers may require LRN to obtain certain personal information, either from the customer or a User, in order for a User to access the online knowledge, training and other services provided on an LRN customer web site. Among other things, LRN may collect the following data: (i) User name; (ii) User identification; (iii) User password; (iv) User email address; and (v) User department(s) and location within the customer organization. LRN may also track the amount of time a User spends on the customer web site, the applications the User employs, the self-tests the User performs, the User's performance on such tests, and other activities in which the User engages while the User is on the LRN customer web site. </p>
                  <p class="body-text">LRN may use non-personal data that it obtains from Users, such as the amount of time Users spend on a specific portion of a web site, to analyze trends, to gather data to benchmark best practices, and to monitor, improve and refine the functionality of the system. LRN generally only uses personal information to provide feedback about a User's activity on an LRN-hosted customer web site. For example, LRN may use personal information to inform a User of his or her performance on tests, or the number of training modules that a User has used. LRN may also use personal information to send e-mails to a User, such as reminder e-mails that the User has not completed certain online courses. LRN may also suggest which online courses are most suitable for a User. </p>
                  <p class="body-text">LRN's arrangements with its customers may require LRN to provide all User information in LRN's possession, including a User's personal information, directly to the customer with which the User is associated (i.e. the User's employer). If a User corresponds with LRN, LRN may keep a record of that correspondence. LRN may also forward correspondence to the customer with which the User is associated. LRN does not transfer any personal User information to any third party (other than LRN's customer) unless it is authorized to do so by the customer with which the User is associated , in connection with the services that LRN provides to customer, or required to do so by applicable law. </p>
                  <p> <span class="body-text-emph">www.lrn.com</span><br>
                      <span class="body-text">Individuals may visit LRN's public web site, www.lrn.com, without disclosing any personal information. LRN may track the activity of visitors to this web site in order to analyze trends, monitor, and to improve and refine the functionality of the site. When used for the above purposes, this data is aggregated and is not stored in any personally identifiable form. </span></p>
                  <p><span class="body-text">Visitors to the www.lrn.com web site may also contact LRN by e-mail. When LRN receives e-mail, it collects the sender's return e-mail address. LRN uses this return address to respond to inquires or comments that it receives. LRN does not share personal information it obtains from visitors who send e-mail to LRN with any third parties, unless it is authorized to do so.</span> </p>
                  <p> <span class="body-text-header">Data Integrity &amp; Data Security</span><br>
                      <br>
                      <span class="body-text">LRN does not process personal information that it receives for any purpose other than to provide online knowledge, training and other services to its customers, pursuant to LRN's arrangements with its customers. Generally, such personal information is provided by either the User or the customer with which the User is associated. LRN maintains such personal information in accordance with arrangements with LRN's customers. </span></p>
                  <p class="body-text">LRN has taken steps to ensure that any information LRN collects is secure by, among other things, limiting the number of people who have physical access to LRN's database servers, utilizing electronic security systems, and using password protections which guard against unauthorized access. </p>
                  <p class="body-text">LRN may, however, aggregate data that it obtains from Users to analyze trends, to gather data to benchmark best practices, and to monitor, improve and refine the functionality of the system.</p>

                      <br>
  LRN is committed to ensuring that the personal information it receives is accurate. At the direction of, and in accordance with, the instructions of LRN's customers, LRN allows Users who make reasonable requests to access their personal information in LRN's possession and to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate information. Users who have questions about personal information on file with LRN may, if the customer so provides, access the customer web site to make such corrections or may contact LRN at the address below. <br>
