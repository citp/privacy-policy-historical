This privacy notice covers LSBF alumni who have completed a course of over 12 months’ duration. It also covers individuals who have chosen to support LSBF in some way that is under the remit of the Alumni and Development Department and have consented to be contacted for one of the purposes set out below. This notice only covers processing of personal data for Alumni and Development purposes as set out below. For other personal data processing related to former-students and alumni see the Student Privacy Notice.

**What personal information do we collect?**  
We may hold a range of personal data about you from a number of sources.  
The majority of the personal data that we hold is information provided to us by you. If you are an alumna/ alumnus of LSBF, personal data collected during your time as a student is transferred from your student record such as your name, date of birth and gender to LSBF’s alumni database when you complete a course of over 12 months’ duration. We may also add information provided by you during interactions with you. If you are a supporter of LSBF, the personal data we hold may be information provided by you during your interaction with us.  
Examples of categories of personal data which we may hold are:

·Personal identifiers – e.g. your name, gender, student/ alumni numbers and your date of birth;

·Contact details – e.g. your postal/ email address, telephone number and contact preferences;

·Information about your time at LSBF – e.g. the courses you completed and your membership of clubs and societies;   
Career details – e.g. job role;

·Records of donations – including financial details and Gift Aid status, where applicable (as required by HMRC);

·Communications between the Alumni and Development Department and you;

·Information about your interactions with LSBF – e.g. records relating to volunteering activities on behalf of the College, online interactions with us on social media, information about your use of College resources or facilities (e.g. the library), information on your engagement with College meetings, events, groups or networks;

·Results of automated decision making and profiling processes to focus our interactions with you

We may also hold information collected from publically available sources, such as social network posts, internet searches and websites, and may augment this information with the personal data you provide to us.

**Why are we collecting your personal data/what are we doing with it (purposes)?**  
We only process data for specified purposes and if it is justified in accordance with data-protection law. In general terms, we process your personal data for the purposes of increasing alumni involvement with the student experience at LSBF, fundraising, alumni/ supporter communications and related activities by the Alumni and Development Department. More specifically, these activities may include:

·sending you publications (e.g. alumni magazines and email newsletters about LSBF and fundraising activities);

·inviting you to alumni and supporter events, reunions and University events;

·informing you of benefits available to alumni and supporters;

·asking you to support LSBF (e.g. contributing to student mentoring schemes or donations);

·fundraising programmes;

·wealth analysis and research in order to improve our understanding of our alumni and supporters, inform our fundraising strategy and target our communications; and

·internal record-keeping and administration (e.g. to process a donation or administer an event which you are attending).

There may be other processing in addition to the above, for example, when you access our website which uses cookies or when we take photos of our events and publish them. This is done on the basis of our policies and we will inform you about such processing at the time when the data is obtained or as soon as reasonably possible thereafter. Use of our websites, including our use of cookies, is covered by our website privacy notice:[https://www.LSBF.org.uk/privacy-policy](https://www.lcca.org.uk/privacy-policy)

**Do we use any automated decision making or profiling?**  
Automated individual decision-making means making a decision solely by automated means without any human involvement and profiling means the automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain things about an individual. We may use automated or manual analyses including segmentation or profiling to link data together to send you communications which are relevant and timely, to identify opportunities which may be of interest to you, to help us identify your potential for supporting LSBF and to avoid approaching you with opportunities which are not of interest. We may carry out wealth screening to focus our conversations with you and ensure we provide you with an experience which is appropriate for you.

  
**What legal bases do we rely on for processing your personal data?**  
Depending on the activity being carried out, we will rely on one of the following conditions for processing: a legitimate interest; a legal obligation; or your consent to process your data, as explained below.

Article 6(1) (c) Legal obligation 

Article 6(1) (f) Legitimate interest

**How we process your information**

We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal information in the following circumstances: 

1\. Where we need to perform the obligations in a contract we have entered into with you, such as the employment contract, or a settlement agreement. Some of the contractual obligations in these contracts continue after your employment has terminated, such as the duty to observe confidentiality. 

2\. Where we need to comply with a legal obligation. 

We may also use your personal information in the following situations, which are likely to be rare: 

1\. Where we need to protect your vital interests (or someone else’s vital interests). Article 6(d).

2\. Where it is needed in the public interest. Article 6(1) (e).

We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law. 

We may process your data for the following purposes:

• Paying you and deducting tax and National Insurance contributions and other lawful deductions.

• Providing you with any employee related benefits to which you are entitled after the termination of your employment.

• To reimburse you for expenses incurred in the course of your employment. 

• Liaising with your pension provider and the trustees/administrators of pension schemes. 

• Administering any contract we have entered into with you.

• Equality and diversity monitoring 

• Publicising our activities (e.g., group photos of events, site visits, etc.). 

Some of the above grounds for processing will overlap and there may be several grounds which justify our use of your personal information. 

How we process “special categories” of more sensitive personal information 

We may also store and use the following “special categories” of more sensitive personal information that we have collected from you: 

• Information about your race or ethnicity, religious beliefs, sexual orientation and political opinions. 

• Trade union membership. 

• Information about your health, including any medical condition, health and sickness records. 

• Biometric data. 

• Information about criminal convictions and offences.

These “special categories” of particularly sensitive personal information require higher levels of protection. We need to have further justification for storing and using this type of personal information. Our data protection policy contains details of the safeguards which we are required by law to maintain when processing such data.

We may process special categories of personal information in the following circumstances: 

1\. Where we need to carry out our legal obligations or exercise rights in connection with employment.

2\. Where it is needed in the public interest: for example, we will use information about your race or national or ethnic origin, religious, philosophical or moral beliefs, or your sexual life or sexual orientation, to ensure meaningful equality and diversity monitoring and reporting. Where possible, we would seek to anonymise this data. 

3\. In limited circumstances, with your explicit written consent. However, we do not need your consent to use special categories of your personal information to carry out our legal obligations or exercise specific rights in the field of employment law. In limited circumstances, we may approach you for your written consent to allow us to process certain particularly sensitive data. If we do so, we will provide you with full details of the information that we would like and the reason we need it, so that you can carefully consider whether you wish to consent. 

Less commonly, we may process this type of information where it is needed in relation to legal claims or where it is needed to protect your interests (or someone else’s interests) and you are not capable of giving your consent, or where you have already made the information public. 

**Who is the information shared with**

We may share your data with third parties, including third-party service providers, Government departments and agencies.
