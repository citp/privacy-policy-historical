</p><p align="center"><br>
<b><font face="verdana,Arial,helvetica" color="#31319C" size="4">LSAC.org's
PRIVACY POLICY</font></b>
</p><p align="left"><font face="verdana,Arial,helvetica" color="#31319C" size="2">We are committed to providing you the best possible online service and
experience and your privacy on the internet is important to us. As part of the
operation of LSAC.org, we gather certain types of information about LSAC.org
users, and we would like to explain the types of information we gather, and what
we do with it.
<b>
</b></font></p><p><font face="verdana,Arial,helvetica" color="#31319C" size="2"><b>Information Collected By LSAC.org</b><br>
LSAC.org collects two types of personally identifying information from users:
personal data that users supply to us voluntarily (such as names and e-mail
addresses); and aggregated data (such as information about traffic patterns on
LSAC.org).</font></p><font face="verdana,Arial,helvetica" color="#31319C" size="2">
<b>
</b><p><b>Personal Data</b><br>
Personal data is collected when users voluntarily provide data to LSAC.org; for
example, when registering for our services or purchasing our products. LSAC’s
primary activity is the collection and dissemination, to law schools and
researchers, of data about persons interested in applying to law school. This
activity is designed to streamline and improve the law school admission process
for both applicants and schools. Data collection and dissemination is the heart
of what we do. LSAC’s <i>Data Retention and Confidentiality</i> policy is
available by <u><a href="../LSAC.asp?url=/lsac/data-retention-policy.asp">clicking here</a></u>.</p>
</font>
<b>
<p><font face="verdana,Arial,helvetica" color="#31319C" size="4">Aggregated Information</font></p>
<font face="verdana,Arial,helvetica" color="#31319C" size="2">
</font></b><font face="verdana,Arial,helvetica" color="#31319C" size="2"><p><b></b>When you visit the LSAC.org site, we collect some basic information that does
not identify individual users. This includes which pages are visited, types of
products purchased, and any feedback from our visitors. We then aggregate this
information with hundreds of thousands of other pieces of information to improve
our site and make your experience on the site as valuable and efficient as
possible.</p>
<b>
</b><p><b><br>
</b>Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or visit, and
information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or site
registrations, is also collected through various methods. For example, LSAC.org
collects IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned
to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers
that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its
IP address, and when you request a page from LSAC.org, our servers log your IP
address. LSAC.org does not link IP addresses to anything personally
identifiable, so although your session will be logged, you will remain anonymous
to us. LSAC.org collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration
and to provide aggregate data about the volume of use on LSAC.org.</p>
<b>
</b><p><b>Use of Cookies</b><br>
LSAC.org also uses "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a
small data file that most major Web sites write to your hard drive for record
keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow LSAC.org to measure activity
on the site and to improve your user experience; for example, opening special
registration sessions within Online Services and on the LSACD on the Web for
plugins, searches, and data population, thus allowing you to cut steps. Except
for personal information voluntarily provided by you (i.e., during registration
or use of our online services), LSAC.org does not use information transferred
through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that
information shared with any third parties whatsoever.</p>
<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you would prefer, you
can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent.
However, it is possible that some parts of the site, such as the Online Services
or LSAC product areas, will not function properly if you do so.</p>
<b>
</b><p><b>Use of Information Collected by our Traffic Analysis Software</b><br>
LSAC.org uses both the personal and aggregated information we collect through
our traffic analysis software for multiple purposes. The information is used to
improve the content of the Web site, to customize the content and/or layout of
the Web site for each individual user and to be able to implement and provide a
more user friendly site that meets the system requirements of our users. This
collected data also helps us get an overview of the number of users visiting our
site so that our systems and servers are running at optimal performance.</p>
</font>
<b>
<p><font face="verdana,Arial,helvetica" color="#31319C" size="4">Security and Credit Card Processing</font></p>
</b>
<font face="verdana,Arial,helvetica" color="#31319C" size="2">
<p>We use the latest encryption technology (SSL – Secure Socket Layer) to keep
your personal information safe. All your personally identifiable information—including
your name, address, and credit card number—is
encrypted using a secure server for maximum security. Your credit card and
billing information cannot be read as it travels to our servers. To ensure that
your information is even more secure, once we receive your personal or credit
card information, we store it on a server that isn't accessible from the
Internet. If you feel more comfortable doing so, you are welcome to call LSAC at
215.968.1001 to register for our services or order our products.</p>
<b>
</b><p><b>Other</b><br>
By using the LSAC.org site, you consent to the collection and use of your
information by LSAC.org as described in this policy.<br>
<br>
LSAC fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use
our services, including LSAC.org, for illegal activities. We reserve the right
to release information about users who we believe are in violation of our
content guidelines. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement
agencies any activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful.<br>
<br>
LSAC.org wants you to be aware that when you click on links that take you to
third-party web sites, you will be subject to the third parties' privacy

By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information
by LSAC. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes
on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we
use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.</p>
