|  LSAC.org's Privacy Policy

****

  
**LSAC.org's PRIVACY POLICY**

We are committed to providing you the best possible online service and experience and your privacy on the internet is important to us. As part of the operation of LSAC.org, we gather certain types of information about LSAC.org users, and we would like to explain the types of information we gather, and what we do with it. ****

**Information Collected By LSAC.org**  
LSAC.org collects two types of personally identifying information from users: personal data that users supply to us voluntarily (such as names and e-mail addresses); and aggregated data (such as information about traffic patterns on LSAC.org).

****

**Personal Data**  
Personal data is collected when users voluntarily provide data to LSAC.org; for example, when registering for our services or purchasing our products. LSAC’s primary activity is the collection and dissemination, to law schools and researchers, of data about persons interested in applying to law school. This activity is designed to streamline and improve the law school admission process for both applicants and schools. Data collection and dissemination is the heart of what we do. LSAC’s _Data Retention and Confidentiality_ policy is available by _[clicking here](https://web.archive.org/web/20060617221344id_/http%3A//lsac.org/LSAC.asp%3Furl%3D/LSAC.asp?url=/lsac/data-retention-policy.asp)_.

Aggregated Information

**

****When you visit the LSAC.org site, we collect some basic information that does not identify individual users. This includes which pages are visited, types of products purchased, and any feedback from our visitors. We then aggregate this information with hundreds of thousands of other pieces of information to improve our site and make your experience on the site as valuable and efficient as possible.

****

**  
** Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or visit, and information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or site registrations, is also collected through various methods. For example, LSAC.org collects IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from LSAC.org, our servers log your IP address. LSAC.org does not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, so although your session will be logged, you will remain anonymous to us. LSAC.org collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to provide aggregate data about the volume of use on LSAC.org.

****

**Use of Cookies**  
LSAC.org also uses "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that most major Web sites write to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow LSAC.org to measure activity on the site and to improve your user experience; for example, opening special registration sessions within Online Services and on the LSACD on the Web for plugins, searches, and data population, thus allowing you to cut steps. Except for personal information voluntarily provided by you (i.e., during registration or use of our online services), LSAC.org does not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties whatsoever.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you would prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the site, such as the Online Services or LSAC product areas, will not function properly if you do so.

****

**Use of Information Collected by our Traffic Analysis Software**  
LSAC.org uses both the personal and aggregated information we collect through our traffic analysis software for multiple purposes. The information is used to improve the content of the Web site, to customize the content and/or layout of the Web site for each individual user and to be able to implement and provide a more user friendly site that meets the system requirements of our users. This collected data also helps us get an overview of the number of users visiting our site so that our systems and servers are running at optimal performance.

**

Security and Credit Card Processing

**

We use the latest encryption technology (SSL – Secure Socket Layer) to keep your personal information safe. All your personally identifiable information—including your name, address, and credit card number—is encrypted using a secure server for maximum security. Your credit card and billing information cannot be read as it travels to our servers. To ensure that your information is even more secure, once we receive your personal or credit card information, we store it on a server that isn't accessible from the Internet. If you feel more comfortable doing so, you are welcome to call LSAC at 215.968.1001 to register for our services or order our products.

****

**Other**  
By using the LSAC.org site, you consent to the collection and use of your information by LSAC.org as described in this policy.

LSAC fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services, including LSAC.org, for illegal activities. We reserve the right to release information about users who we believe are in violation of our content guidelines. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful.

LSAC.org wants you to be aware that when you click on links that take you to third-party web sites, you will be subject to the third parties' privacy policies. While we support the protection of privacy on the Internet, LSAC.org cannot be responsible for the actions of third parties.
