### 10\. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION STUDIES & MARKET RESEARCH ACTIVITIES

#### Product & Market Research at Broadcom

The market research process at Broadcom includes quantitative and qualitative studies on a wide range of topics. Quantitative studies may include surveys focused on overall markets, regions, applications, customers, or resellers. Qualitative studies include in-depth interviews, traditional in-person focus groups, or the use of online discussion boards or Blogs.

The idea behind all these processes is to learn what is important to you and tailor Broadcom products, systems, services, and support to exceed your expectations. If you are invited to participate in a research study for Broadcom, you may be asked, for example, to evaluate prototype technologies, share impressions of marketing communications materials, or discuss aspects of our web site.

#### Measuring Customer Satisfaction at Broadcom

The Broadcom Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) program is an ongoing, systematic study of customer experiences at key touch points across the global Broadcom organization. The term customer refers to: current, former, or potential customers of Broadcom, visitors to Broadcom’ web site, and resellers or channel partners working with Broadcom.

CSAT surveys are conducted at regular intervals using state-of-the-art web survey methodologies. Surveys are offered in multiple languages, and are designed to run smoothly on multiple operating systems and browsers.

CSAT measures your satisfaction after a recent interaction or transaction with one of Broadcom's customer touch points. If you recently received a survey invitation it is because you:

  * Contacted Broadcom Technical Support
  * Contacted a Broadcom Business Center
  * Visited the Broadcom web site, or
  * Had recent contact with the Broadcom account team that supports your organization.



The customer survey process begins by sending you an e-mail invitation, sent from a senior Broadcom representative who is identified by name. You the recipient can contact that Broadcom representative to validate the study, or ask questions about the survey methodology.

#### Why Broadcom surveys its customers

The process of inviting customers to complete surveys is done with one overriding goal in mind: to enhance your experience with Broadcom.

#### How often are Broadcom CSAT surveys conducted?

Each Broadcom touch point is studied twice a year so managers have up-to-date information on the customer or visitor experience at those touch points, and a clear picture of what to do to enhance your satisfaction when you interact with Broadcom personnel at those touch points. In research conducted with our customers on the issue of survey frequency, customers told us receiving survey invitations as often as twice a year was deemed "acceptable".

It is not our intention to survey you EVERY time you interact with one of our touch points. We use random sampling procedures and database tools to help keep the number of survey invitations sent to you under control. We understand few people actually enjoy completing surveys, but we know surveys are a valuable link between you and Broadcom management, and we want to keep that link open. The survey mechanism provides you a unique opportunity to speak your mind about how we are performing. Furthermore, you control whether you identify yourself or submit your comments anonymously.

At Broadcom, it’s always your call whether to respond when invited to participate in a survey.

#### Broadcom ascribes to the Marketing Research Association’s Ethical Guidelines for the Use of the Internet for Conducting Opinion & Marketing Research.

Broadcom is a member of the Marketing Research Association and follows the MRA Guidelines for web-based research, whose provisions include:

  * Your cooperation will be voluntary
  * Our identity will be disclosed
  * Your rights to anonymity will be safeguarded
  * Our privacy policy statements will be posted online (See items 1 through 9, above)
  * Data security is maintained
  * Unsolicited e-mail is not sent to those who have opted out of receiving such e-mail
  * For details on these Guidelines, or more information on the MRA, click here: [http://www.mra-net.org](http://www.mra-net.org/)



#### Survey FAQ's

#### 1\. If I agree to take this survey, will I be bombarded with more surveys from Broadcom?

No. Broadcom is working closely with our survey research partner to limit the number of survey invitations a customer receives. Typically, you will not receive more than 2 survey invitations related to a given touch point in a 12-month period.

#### 2\. If I complete an Broadcom survey, will my contact information be sold or given to other companies for marketing or sales purposes, or used by Broadcom for its own marketing or sales purposes?

No. At Broadcom, we take your concern for privacy seriously. Survey databases containing names and identifying information of persons who have had recent contact with Broadcom are never merged with marketing databases, nor shared with other parts of the Broadcom organization. These data are not released to third-party organizations or individuals outside the Broadcom organization, except to be provided to the CSAT survey research vendor who, as part of their contract with Broadcom, manages the process of mailing e-mail invitations to you. The CSAT vendor operates under a PERSONAL DATA CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT (PDCA) with Broadcom, which includes the following provision, “(Vendor) may not disclose Personal Information to any other third party without the prior written consent of Broadcom. Under no circumstances may Participant sell, rent or lease Personal Information to any third parties.”

#### 3\. I was asked if I wanted to receive an Broadcom newsletter and opted out. Why then am I getting a survey from Broadcom?

Before sending you a newsletter or marketing-related information about new Broadcom products or services, Broadcom will ask you to opt-in to confirm your interest in this information. If you elect to opt out of this type of information, no further marketing-related information will be sent to you.

The CSAT survey is a separate form of communication with our customers and channel partners, and is not classified as a marketing-related communication. It is often the concluding step in a process that began with a recent transaction or interaction with Broadcom. As such, the prior opt-in requirement is not relevant.

Having said that, survey participation is still voluntary. You can elect not to respond to a given survey. Our survey e-mail invitation also provides you with an means to opt-out of the entire survey process. However, if you exercise this option, you will no longer have an opportunity to share your opinions or ideas with Broadcom senior management through the CSAT program.

#### 4\. How do I know you won’t publish my name along with my responses to the CSAT survey?

Your name or identifying data such as e-mail address, is NEVER published in CSAT reports. However, there are three scenarios where your name may appear in CSAT documents or communications, or where you may wish to provide your name in the course of completing the survey:

  * If, in the course of completing the CSAT survey, you ask Broadcom to follow up with you—to address a matter of concern to you, you then give our research vendor permission to forward your name and contact information to the appropriate manager at Broadcom to facilitate immediate follow-up and action.
  * At the conclusion of the survey, you are asked if you want to give Broadcom permission to “share your individual responses.” Most of our survey respondents (87%) give us permission to do so. Even when you give us permission to share your individual responses, we do not publish your name or personal identifying information in reports of findings. CSAT reports typically report findings on a touch point, regional, job-category, applications area, or product-category basis.
  * At the conclusion of some CSAT surveys, respondents are invited to provide their name and contact information for the purposes of a gift drawing, as a thank-you for completing the survey. This information is used only to make a random selection among those providing information, and to locate the winners to do gift fulfillment. Beyond these purposes, names and contact information are not released.
