                                 <h5>Information We Collect:</h5>
<p>In some areas of our website, we request you to provide or submit personal information including your name,
address, e-mail address, telephone number, contact information, billing information and any other information
from which your identity is discernible. Letsintern also collects or may collect demographic information that
is not unique to you such as your ZIP code, age, preferences and gender. Example of such a situation could be
when you sign up to use our service, post a resume or enter a contest or survey. In addition we may indirectly
collect information about you when you use certain third party services on our website; such information will
be subject to, and treated in accordance with, the policies and practices described in this Statement.</p>
 
<p>We also gather or may gather certain information about your use of our site, such as what areas you visit
and what services you access. Moreover, there is information about your computer hardware and software that
is or may be collected by us. This information can include without limitation your IP address, browser type,
domain names, access times and referring website addresses.</p>
 
<p>When you sign up for a LetsIntern discussion forum, your name or alias is recorded solely for purposes
of maintaining your own account within the forums. This information is not used to monitor your activity
within a forum, nor is it used to identify you outside the Letsintern. When you use co-branded services, 
or those provided by a third party,  within the Letsintern website, your information may be passed to the
co-brand or third party provider and their use of your information is subject to their applicable privacy policies.</p>
 
<p>Please remember that if you post any of your personal information in public areas of Letsintern, 
such as in online forums, chat rooms or searchable resume database, such information may be collected 
and used by others over whom Letsintern has no control. We are not responsible for the use made by third
parties of information you post or otherwise make available in public areas of this website.</p>
 
<p>Letsintern may sometimes afford you the opportunity to provide descriptive, cultural, behavioral
and preferential and/or life style information about yourself, but it is solely up to you whether
you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the 
use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Statement. 
For example, such information may be used for the purpose of determining your potential interest in
receiving email or other communications about particular products or services.</p>
 
<p>We believe that managing your career is a life-long process. Hence, we retain indefinitely all the 
information we gather about you in an effort to make your repeat use with us more efficient, practical,
and relevant. Of course, you can correct or update your account profile and resume at any time. Moreover,
you can delete your resume from our online database or close your account at any time, in which event we 
will remove all our copies of your resume and your account profile information except for an archival copy
which is not accessible on the internet.</p>
 <p>
Granting us this permission not only allows us to provide Letsintern as it exists today, but it
also allows us to provide you with innovative features and services we develop in the future that 
use the information we receive about you in new ways.
                             </p>
 <p>
While you are allowing us to use the information we receive about you, you always own all of your
information. Your trust is important to us, which is why we don't share information we receive about
you with others unless we have:
                             </p>
<ul>
    <li>received your permission;</li>
        <li>given you notice, such as by telling you about it in this policy; or</li>
        <li>removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it.</li>
</ul> <br>
Of course, for information others share about you, they control how it is shared.
<br>
<br><h5>How The Information is Used</h5>
We use the information we gather on the website for the purposes of providing our services, 
responding to any queries you may have, operating and improving the web site, fostering a positive 
user experience and delivering the products and services that we offer to jobseekers and employers. 
Our services include the display of personalized products, content, and advertising relating to your 
career experience and interests, either on our site or other sites with which we have a business relationship.
The information we gather on any Letsinetn website may be shared within the Letsintern group of companies or any 
of the Letsintern-affiliated companies in order to deliver the products and services we offer to employers such 
as searches for job seekers or in order to undertake analysis of our database such as aggregate profiling of our 
registered users.
 
<h5>Online Security:</h5>
If you are buying a product from Letsintern via the wbsite, your personal details and credit card information
are scrambled using Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") encryption technology before being sent over the Internet.
SSL makes it very difficult for your information to be stolen or intercepted while being transferred. 
However, we cannot guarantee encryption or the privacy of your personal details and credit card information. 
When we receive your order, it is kept encrypted until we are ready to process it. We will take reasonable
steps to keep the information you provide us with secure.

<p>Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on your computer, mobile phone or other device. 
    Pixels are small blocks of code on webpages that do things like allow another server to measure
    viewing of a webpage and often are used in connection with cookies.</p>
 
<p>We use technologies like cookies, pixels, and local storage (like on your browser or device, which is similar to a cookie but holds more information)
    to provide and understand a range of products and services. </p>
 
                                 <ul>We use these technologies to do things like:
                                     <li>make Letsintern easier or faster to use;</li>
                                         <li>enable features and store information about you (including on your device or in your browser cache) and your use of Letsintern;</li>
                                             <li>deliver, understand and improve advertising;</li>
                                                 <li>monitor and understand the use of our products and services;</li>
                                                     <li>to protect you, others and Letsintern.</li>
                                 </ul>
<p>You have the option of setting your browser to reject cookies. However, doing this will hinder performance
    and negatively impact your experience on our website. </p>
 
<p>We also allow other companies to display advertisements to you while you are visiting our website. 
    Because your web browser must request these advertisements from the other company's servers, these
    companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a webpage from their site.
    Letsintern has no control over, and is not responsible for, the practices of those third party advertisers. 
    Letsintern encourages you to review the policies of such advertisers. </p>
 
<p>You can opt-out of customized advertising by third parties by setting your browser to decline third party
    cookies or some browsers allow you to block cookies from a particular third party whose customized advertising 
    you do not wish to receive. You can also delete the advertiser's cookie each time after it has been served. In 
    addition, third party advertisers, including advertising networks, may offer an opt-out of their customized 
    advertising.</p>
