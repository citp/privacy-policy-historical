# White House Online Privacy Policy | The White House

####  Information You Give Us

You do not have to provide the White House with any personal information or create a user account to access information on WhiteHouse.gov. However, for some services, we may need some personal information from you such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address. For example:

  * The [“Contact the White House” form](http://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/submit-questions-and-comments) asks for basic contact information so we can respond to your request;
  * When we ask users to share their story or how a policy decision will impact them, we generally ask for their name, zip code, and email address;
  * Creating a user account for our online petitions platform [“We the People”](http://petitions.whitehouse.gov/) requires a valid email address and a first and last name; and
  * We may ask for personal information from people applying to, registering for, or participating in a White House event or competition.



####  Visits to WhiteHouse.gov

When you visit WhiteHouse.gov, the following basic information is automatically received and stored by the web servers hosting WhiteHouse.gov:

  * The originating Internet Protocol (IP) address;


  * The internet domain name;
  * Information about your computer or mobile set-up (e.g., type and version of web browser, operating system, screen resolution, and connection speed);
  * The pages on WhiteHouse.gov that you visit;
  * The internet address, or URL, of the website that connected you to our site, if you accessed WhiteHouse.gov via a link on another page (i.e., “referral traffic”); and
  * The amount of data transmitted from WhiteHouse.gov to your computer.



The White House also uses web measurement and customization technologies (such as “cookies"). You can choose not to accept cookies from any website, including WhiteHouse.gov, by changing your browser settings. [Click here to learn more about how we use cookies](https://web.archive.org/privacy/cookies).

####  Using the WhiteHouse.gov Mobile Application

When you use the WhiteHouse.gov [Mobile Application](http://www.whitehouse.gov/mobile) (“App”), the App pulls content from the White House website, generating the same basic information as when you visit WhiteHouse.gov (see Visits to WhiteHouse.gov). The WhiteHouse.gov Mobile App does not collect geolocation information or use location services.

You may sign up to receive “push notification” messages via a third party provider (currently Urban Airship). To make sure messages reach the correct devices, our third party provider relies on a device token unique to your mobile device. While we may be able to access a list of the tokens, the App and tokens do not reveal your identity, unique device ID, or contact information to us. If, at any time, you wish to stop receiving push notifications, simply adjust your phone settings or remove the App.

The White House receives aggregate data about the use of our App, such as the number of people who have opened the App from a third party provider (currently Google Analytics). We also receive aggregate data from the platforms that distribute our App (currently the iTunes Store and Google Play Store), such as the number of people who download the App and mobile set-up information (e.g., device model, App version, country, language, and mobile carrier). Please consult the privacy policies of these third parties for further information.

####  Email Subscriptions

In order to manage White House email subscription lists, we retain the names and email address of our email subscribers, as well as other information they may have shared with us (e.g., addresses and phone numbers), logs of emails we send, and automatically generated email data used to improve our email communications. This automatically generated email data (generated through simple tools such as “pixel tags” and link redirects) includes:

  * The recipient’s email client;
  * Whether the email was opened;
  * If a link in the message was clicked;
  * Whether an email was delivered;
  * If the email was forwarded; and
  * If the email was printed.



If, at any time, you wish to stop receiving our messages, simply click on the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each email message.

####  Third-Party Websites

The White House maintains official pages or accounts on third-party websites in order to better engage with the American public ([a current list is here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/privacy/current-third-party-pages)). Your activity on those sites is governed by the third-party website’s security and privacy policies. Users of third-party sites often share information with the general public, user community, and/or the third-party operating the site. Consequently, you should review the privacy policies of third-party sites before using them and ensure that you understand how your information may be shared and used. You should also adjust privacy settings on your account on any third-party site to match your preferences.

For the sole purpose of complying with the [Presidential Records Act](http://www.archives.gov/about/laws/presidential-records.html), the White House archives some information that users submit or publish when engaging with the White House through official White House pages or accounts on third-party websites (e.g., by sending a message, posting a comment, “following,” “friending,” or taking similar actions). This information may contain personal information, such as an individual’s username and other public account information, when such information is available based on the user’s privacy settings and the terms of the site. For example:

  * On Twitter, the White House automatically archives “tweets” from official White House accounts, “direct messages” sent to or from official White House accounts, and “mentions” (tweets from other users to official White House accounts; these tweets contain an @ and the username of an official White House account (e.g., [@WhiteHouse](http://www.twitter.com/whitehouse)). The White House also automatically archives any status that official accounts have “favorited.”
  * On Facebook, the White House automatically archives all content created by official White House pages, content that tags an official White House page, and any content posted on official White House pages (for example, the number of likes to the page and comments posted).
  * On Google+, the White House automatically archives all content posted by official White House accounts, as well as the number of likes/comments/shares on each of those posts (including the comments themselves). The White House also automatically archives the total number of Google+ users that have added our page to a “Circle,” and the list of users that White House accounts have added to “Circles.”



For aggregate statistical analysis and to improve the quality of our services, we may integrate web measurement tools with our social media pages. These tools enable basic analysis of social media traffic (such as the number of people visiting a certain page) and do not collect personally identifiable information.
