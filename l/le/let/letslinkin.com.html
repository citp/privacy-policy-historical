<h3 align="center">Privacy Policy</h3>
<p align="left"><strong><u>Privacy Protection </u></strong><br>
<br>
This policy establishes how we handle the information we learn about you when 
you visit letslinkin.com (the "Website"). Protecting the privacy and personal 
data of our visitors is important to us, and we are committed to collecting, 
maintaining, and securing your personal information in strict accordance with 
the principles described in this policy.<br>
<br>
Throughout this policy, the term "You" or "Your" refers to you, the visitor 
providing information to letslinkin.com. The term "We", "Our" or "Website" 
refers to this website, letslinkin.com. <br>
<br>
<strong><u>Collection of Information</u></strong><br>
<br>
In order to provide you with the highest level of service, we ask that you 
voluntarily provide us with certain information about yourself (collectively, 
your "Information"). Your Information includes, among other things, your name, 
your gender, your age, your physical location, your email address, and other 
information about yourself. Your Information may also include pictures and/or 
videos that your provide to the Website. Depending on how you participate at the 
Website, you also may be required to provide certain financial information to 
us.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Use of Information</u></strong><br>
<br>
Our privacy policy is simple: no one sees your Information unless (i) you want 
them to or, as described below, (ii) we have to share such information to comply 
with the law or to protect the Website.<br>
<br>
We may disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law or we in 
good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or 
with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect 
against misuse or unauthorized use of our website; or (4) protect the personal 
safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, this means 
that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, 
information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your 
actions).<br>
<br>
In addition, we may use the information we obtain from our members in the 
aggregate (with all personally identifiable information removed) for promotional 
purposes, or to determine our members' demographics and preferences. By doing 
so, we are able to deliver targeted advertisements on our website which you may 
find to be helpful and informative. Also, in the unlikely event that the 
Website, or substantially all of the Website's assets are acquired, your 
Information may be one of the transferred assets.<br>
<br>
Unless otherwise specified, we reserve the right to keep a copy of your 
Information indefinitely, and use such information in accordance with the terms 
of this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Maintenance or Revisions to Your Information</u></strong><br>
<br>
In order to make sure that you receive the full benefit of our website, you 
should make sure that we have the most up-to-date information about you. Please 
remember that we will not remind you to update your information, and it is your 
responsibility to make sure that we have your correct information.<br>
<br>
As a registered member, you can revise your information at any time. <br>
<br>
<strong><u>Internet Privacy</u></strong><br>
<br>
In order to provide better service, we will occasionally use a "cookie." A 
cookie is a small amount of data which our website stores on your computer, and 
which we can later retrieve. The cookie cannot be read by a site other than 
ours. We use cookies for a number of administrative purposes; for example, to 
store your preferences for certain kinds of information. No cookie will contain 
information that will allow anyone to contact you via telephone, e-mail, or any 
other means. You can monitor our use of cookies on your computer by setting your 
Web browser to inform you when cookies are set, or you can prevent the cookies 
from being set entirely. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will 
tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the 
browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies 
altogether. Please understand that if you disable the use of cookies on your 
computer, you may be unable to access certain portions or services of our 
website.<br>
<br>
The Website also may use third parties to display advertisements and track leads 
and/or sales from our website. These ads and/or tracking functions may use 
cookies. The Website does not control these cookies, and they are not subject to 
the Website's privacy policy.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</u></strong><br>
<br>
The Website is directed to the general public. The Website does not knowingly 
offer services or information to children, nor does the Website knowingly 
request information from children. If you are under 18, you may not use the 
Website under any circumstances. We reserve the right to cancel, without prior 
notice to you, any services or access requested by you if we know, or have 
reason to believe, you are not over the age of 18.<br>

policy. Any revisions or additions to this policy will be posted on this page.

at the Website, please send a thorough description of your concerns to

try to resolve them. This policy may change, and use of information that we 
gather is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time of collection or 
use of the information.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Electronic Notification</u></strong><br>
<br>
When you sign up with the Website, you consent to receive any privacy or other 
notices, agreements, disclosures, reports, documents, communications, or other 
records (collectively, "Notices") from the Website electronically. You consent 
to receive Notices electronically in either or both of the following ways: </p>

You can always choose not to provide us with your Information, even though it 
might be needed in order to begin or continue your registration or membership 
with the Website. When you update information in the manner described above, we
