10\. Security and Protection of Customer Information

10.1 Security

  1. Passwords



You must not share your password for any services or portal access. Your passwords and the answers to secret questions are your responsibility, and must not be disclosed to any third party. This is also important for your own protection.

  1. i Data Security Procedures



We are constantly reviewing our procedures to protect your Personal Data from unauthorised access, accidental loss and/or destruction. We may employ third parties, including members of the Lebara Group, to provide services on our behalf. In such cases, if they collect any Personal Data on their own behalf it will be covered by this policy. We do endeavour to ensure that any partners we use apply the same high standards of privacy and security over your Personal Data.

10.2 Users 16 and under

If you are aged 16 or under, please get your parent or guardian's permission before providing any Personal Data. Users without this consent are not allowed to provide us with Personal Data.

10.3 Co-Branded Micro Sites and Third Party Sites

Some web pages and Micro Websites included within Lebara’s websites may be co-branded with third party names, logos, or properties. These Micro Websites are operated or maintained by or on behalf of Lebara. While such third parties are sponsors of these web pages or Micro Websites, Lebara does not share any personal data collected within those web pages or Micro Websites with these third parties unless otherwise stated.

This policy does not apply to third party sites that you may access via our portals. You should therefore ensure that you are familiar with the applicable third party privacy policy before entering any personal information on a third party site.

10.4 Non-EEA Use of Personal Data

The Personal Data you provide to us may be passed to entities outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”), including to Lebara Group companies such as Lebara Australia (Pty) Ltd., and Lebara GmbH in Switzerland, and other third parties in non-EEA countries. Some countries outside the EEA do not have an adequate level of protection. However we will always take steps to ensure that your Personal Data is used by such entities in accordance with this policy.

10.5 Marketing Information from Third Parties

If you choose to receive marketing information from other companies, we will only disclose your Personal Data to these companies where they have undertaken not to use your Personal Data for any purpose other than to provide information to you or other uses to which you have agreed. If you decide that you no longer want to receive information from a particular company, you should contact that company directly. You should be aware that if you subsequently give any Personal Data to another company, the uses to which that information may be put will be determined by that company's privacy policy.
