<p>		7 Accessing your Information<br>
		7.1 If you are a Lebara Registered Customer, you may verify, update or amend the personal information you have provided to Lebara online at any time by clicking on "Edit User Profile" under the website navigation heading "My Lebara". The 'opt-in' on the website allows you to select whether you receive marketing information from Lebara only, or from our business partners. You can opt-out of either or both at any time.<br>
		7.2 We can supply certain types of personal information on request: including but not limited to billing, name and address, aggregated phone usage. Requests should be made in writing and include your name, mobile telephone number and proof of your identity (such as a photocopy of your passport, birth certificate or driving licence) and address (for example, a copy of a utility bill or bank statement), and the information you require. We'll charge you £10 to cover the administrative cost of supplying the requested information. If we hold any inaccurate information about you, please tell us and we will correct it.<br>

<p>		8 Changes to this Policy<br>
		We will keep this policy under review and any changes made from time to time will be posted on this page.</p>
<p>		9 Security and Protection of Customer Information<br>
		9.1 Security<br>
		i) Passwords<br>
		You must not share your password for any message services or portal access. Your passwords and the answers to secret questions are your responsibility, and must not be disclosed to any third party. This is also important for your own protection.<br>
		ii) Data Security Procedures<br>
		We are constantly reviewing our procedures to protect your personal data from unauthorised access, accidental loss and/or destruction.<br>
		We may employ third parties, including members of the Lebara Group, to provide services on our behalf. In such cases, if they collect any data on their own behalf it will be covered by this policy unless they inform you that they provide their own privacy policy. We do endeavour to ensure that any partners we use apply the same high standards of privacy and security over your information. However, we advise you to read their policy carefully.<br>
		iii) Security of Communications<br>
		Please be aware that communications over the Internet, such as e-mails and Webmails, are not secure unless they have been encrypted. Your communications may route through a number of countries before being delivered - this is the nature of the World Wide Web/Internet. Lebara cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.<br>
		iv) Media Messaging<br>
		If you are registered with <a href="http://www.lebara.co.uk">www.lebara.co.uk</a>, any Media Messages you send to an email address, including Media Messages from your phone and messages from <a href="http://www.lebara.co.uk">www.lebara.co.uk</a>, may include personal details such as your registered first name and last name, your phone number or email address which will be displayed in the 'from' field of the message.<br>
		9.2 Users 16 and under<br>
		If you are aged 16 or under, please get your parent or guardian's permission before providing any personal information. Users without this consent are not allowed to provide us with personal information.<br>
		9.3 Co-Branded Micro Sites and Third Party Sites<br>
		Some web pages and Micro Websites included within Lebara’s websites may be co-branded with third party names, logos, or properties. These Micro Websites are operated or maintained by or on behalf of Lebara. While such third parties are sponsors of these web pages or Micro Websites, the third parties do not share in any personally identifiable information collected within those web pages or Micro Websites unless otherwise stated. Save for pages hosted by Lebara's payment processor, Mi-Pay Ltd (to whom this policy will apply), this policy does not apply to third party sites that you may access via our portals. You should therefore ensure that you are familiar with the applicable third party privacy policy before entering any personal information on a third party site<br>
		9.4 Non-EEA Use of Information<br>
		The information you provide to us may be passed to third parties located outside the European Economic Area. Countries outside the European Economic Area do not always have strong data protection laws. However we will always take steps to ensure that your information is used by third parties in accordance with this policy. Additional terms and conditions may be presented when signing up for specific products and services.<br>
		9.5 Marketing Information from Third Parties<br>
		If you choose to receive marketing information from other companies, we will only disclose your personal information to these companies where they have undertaken not to use your personal information for any purpose other than to provide information to you or other uses to which you have agreed. If you decide that you no longer want to receive information from a particular company, you should contact that company directly. You should be aware that if you subsequently give any personal information to another company, the uses to which that information may be put will be determined by that company's privacy policy.</p>
<p>
		10 Marketing Information from Third Parties<br>
		10.1 If you choose to receive marketing information from other companies, we will only disclose your personal information to these companies where they have undertaken not to use your personal information for any purpose other than to provide information to you or other uses to which you have agreed. If you decide that you no longer want to receive information from a particular company, you should contact that company directly.<br>
		10.2 You should be aware that if you subsequently give any personal information to another company, the uses to which that information may be put will be determined by that company's privacy policy.</p>
