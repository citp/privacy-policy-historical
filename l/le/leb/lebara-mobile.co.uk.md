You must not share your password for any message services or portal access. Your passwords and the answers to secret questions are your responsibility, and must not be disclosed to any third party. This is also important for your own protection.   
ii) Data Security Procedures  
We are constantly reviewing our procedures to protect your personal data from unauthorised access, accidental loss and/or destruction.  
We may employ third parties, including members of the Lebara Group, to provide services on our behalf. In such cases, if they collect any data on their own behalf it will be covered by this policy unless they inform you that they provide their own privacy policy. We do endeavour to ensure that any partners we use apply the same high standards of privacy and security over your information. However, we advise you to read their policy carefully.   
iii) Security of Communications  
Please be aware that communications over the Internet, such as e-mails and Webmails, are not secure unless they have been encrypted. Your communications may route through a number of countries before being delivered - this is the nature of the World Wide Web/Internet. Lebara cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.

If you decide that you no longer want to receive information from a particular company, you should contact that company directly. You should be aware that if you subsequently give any personal information to another company, the uses to which that information may be put will be determined by that company's privacy policy.
