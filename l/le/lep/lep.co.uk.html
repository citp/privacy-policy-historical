		<ol>
			<li>Johnston Press Plc is a member of the Johnston Press Plc Group.  We will use your personal details and information we obtain from other sources to provide you with our goods and services, for administration and customer services, for credit scoring, for marketing, to analyse your purchasing preferences and to ensure that the content, services and advertising that we offer are tailored to your needs and interests. We may keep your information for a reasonable period for these purposes. We may need to share your information with our service providers and agents for these purposes.   We may disclose personal data in order to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li><br clear="all"><br clear="all">
			<li>We may also store information about you using cookies (files which are sent by us to your computer or other access device) which we can access when you visit our site in future. We do this to operate a shopping cart and to remember your content preferences.</li><br clear="all"><br clear="all">
			<li>If you want to delete any cookies that are already on your computer, please refer to the instructions for your file management software to locate the file or directory that stores cookies.</li><br clear="all"><br clear="all">
			<li>Information on deleting or controlling cookies is available at www.AboutCookies.org. Please note that by deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies you may not be able to access certain areas or features of our site.</li><br clear="all"><br clear="all">
			<li>When you visit our site, we may also log your IP address, a unique identifier for your computer or other access device.</li><br clear="all"><br clear="all">
			<li>We also include web beacons (also known as clear GIFs or web bugs) in our emails to track the success of our marketing campaigns.  This means that if you open an email from us we can see which pages of our site you visit.  Our web beacons do not store additional information on your computer, but by communicating with our cookies on your computer, they can tell us when you have opened our email.  If you object to web beacons, we recommend you follow the instructions for deleting existing cookies and disabling future cookies in paragraph 4.  We will still know how many of our mails are opened and we will automatically receive your IP address, but we will not identify you as an individual.</li><br clear="all"><br clear="all">
			<li>In assessing your application for credit, to prevent fraud, to check your identity and to prevent money laundering, Johnston Press may search the files of credit reference agencies who will record any credit searches on your file.  We may also disclose details of how you conduct your account to such agencies.  The information will be used by other credit grantors for making credit decisions about you and the people with whom you are financially associated, for fraud prevention, money laundering prevention and occasionally for tracing debtors.  Information used for these purposes will include publicly available information such as electoral roll, county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossessions.</li><br clear="all"><br clear="all">
			<li>We may ask credit reference agencies to provide a credit scoring computation.  Credit scoring uses a number of factors to work out risks involved in any application.  A score is given to each factor and a total score obtained.  Where automatic credit scoring computations are used, acceptance or rejection of your application will not depend only on the results of the credit scoring process.</li><br clear="all"><br clear="all">
			<li>We may also share your information with our business partners in the travel, property, automotive, financial services, leisure, entertainment, advertising, media, retail and mail order business for marketing purposes or we may send you information about other organisations' goods and services.

By providing us with your fax number, land line and/or mobile telephone numbers or email address you consent to being contacted by these methods for these purposes.

If we do make such a transfer, we will, if appropriate, put a contract in place to ensure that your information is protected.</li><br clear="all"><br clear="all">
			<li> If you provide us with information about another person, you confirm that they have appointed you to act for them, to consent to the processing of their personal data including sensitive personal data and that you have informed them of our identity and the purposes (as set out above) for which their personal data will be processed.</li><br clear="all"><br clear="all">
