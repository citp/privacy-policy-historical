## DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION

We do not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal course of business to provide our services.

#### Advertisers

We gather personal information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes. In other words, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally. Certain information, such as your name, email address, password, credit card number, and bank account number, are not disclosed to these third parties in a personally identifiable manner without your consent.

#### User Name

Your User Name is displayed throughout the Site and is therefore available to the public. All of your activities on the Site will be identifiable to your User Name. Other people can see the items you are offering to sell and items that you want, items that you have purchased in the past, your feedback or review rating and associated comments, your postings on the Site, and so on. Therefore, if you associate your name with your User Name, the people you have revealed your name to will be able to personally identify your LePrix activities. Although our pages are coded with robot exclusion headers, others may illegally attempt to automatically collect your email address from the Site. We describe how to change your email and User Name below. If you are involved in a transaction, we have features that allow other members to view your email address and obtain your contact and shipping information to help complete the transaction. Further, we may send out notices to you or other members regarding suspicious activity or policy violations on the Site.

#### Third Party Service Providers

We may use third parties service providers ("service providers") to facilitate one or more aspects of the business, product and service operations that we provide to you (e.g., search technology, discussion boards, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs, co-branded credit cards) and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to these service providers. These service providers' are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced LePrix related operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses. In some instances, the service provider may collect information directly from you. In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the service provider, and all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be strictly up to you. If you provide additional information to a service provider directly, then their use of your personal information is governed by their applicable privacy policy.

#### Business Transfers

In event of a corporate merger, reorganization, dissolution, selling of assets or business, or similar events, personal information may be transferred as part of assets.

#### Legal Requests

LePrix cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights, to help protect you and the LePrix community from bad actors. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, email address, User Name history, fraud complaints, and bidding and listing history without a subpoena. Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to: prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; or report suspected illegal activity.

Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or members may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.

## USING OTHER MEMBERS' PERSONAL INFORMATION
