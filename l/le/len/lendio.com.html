				<div><p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>Lendio, Inc. respects the privacy of our clients and has developed this
Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to protecting your privacy.
This policy describes and sets forth our policies on the following
topics:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Collection and Use</p></li>
<li><p>How we collect and use information</p></li>
<li><p>Disclosure of your information to third-parties</p></li>
<li><p>Making updates or changes to your information; Data retention</p></li>
<li><p>Security</p></li>
<li><p>Choice/Opt-out</p></li>
<li><p>Information obtained from third-parties</p></li>
<li><p>Notification of Privacy Policy changes</p></li>
<li><p>Contact information</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This privacy statement describes how Lendio collects and uses the
personal information you provide on our website:
<a href="http://www.lendio.com/">www.lendio.com</a>. It also describes the choices
available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how
you can access and update this information.</p>

<p><strong>1. Collection and Use</strong></p>

<p>We collect the following personal information:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Contact information such as name, mailing address, e-mail and
telephone.</p></li>
<li><p>Unique identifiers such as user name, account number and password.</p></li>
<li><p>Preferences information such as product wish lists, order history
and marketing preferences.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We collect the following information regarding your business:</p>

<ul>
<li>Name, address, telephone, size, type and business credit report.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. How we collect and use information</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Log Files:</em> Any time you visit any of our websites, our servers
automatically gather information from your browser (such as your IP
addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP),
referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of
clicks) to analyze trends, administer the site, prevent fraud, track
visitor movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic
information. For example, we may log your IP address for system
administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to track a user´s
session. This gives us an idea of which parts of our site users are
visiting. We do not share the log files externally.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Cookies:</em> We use "cookies" to keep track of some types of
information while you are visiting our website or using our
services. Cookies are very small files placed on your computer, and
they allow us to count the number of visitors to our website and
distinguish repeat visitors from new visitors. They also allow us to
save user preferences and track user trends. We rely on cookies for
the proper operation of our website; therefore if your browser is
set to reject all cookies, the website will not function properly.
Users who refuse cookies assume all responsibility for any resulting
loss of functionality. We do not link the cookies to any personally
identifiable information.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Web Beacons:</em> "Web beacons" (also known as "clear gifs" and "pixel
tags") are small transparent graphic images that are often used in
conjunction with cookies in order to further personalize our website
for our users and to collect a limited set of information about our
visitors. We may also use web beacons in email communications in
order to understand the behavior of our customers. We do not link
the web beacons to any personally identifiable information.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Sign-Up Information:</em> To process sign-ups, we may require your
name, address, phone number, email address and credit card
information. Such information is used primarily to process your
order or as otherwise described herein. Credit card transactions are
processed through industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) by a
third party, which only uses your information for that purpose.</p></li>
<li><p><em>E-mails and Telephone Calls:</em> We require an e-mail address from you
when you register for our services. We use your e-mail for both
transactional (e.g., order confirmation, refund and renewal
processing) and promotional (e.g., newsletters, new product
offerings, special discounts, event notifications, special
third-party offers) purposes. E-mail messages we send you may
contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the
e-mails, including whether the e-mail was opened and what links (if
any) were clicked. If you would rather not receive promotional
e-mails from us, please see the section below labeled
"Choice/Opt-Out". We reserve the right to send you certain
communications relating to the Lendio services, such as service
announcements and administrative messages, without offering you the
opportunity to opt out of receiving them. We may also contact you by
telephone or text message (including to any wireless number you may
provide to us) solely in connection with Lendio´s services. If you
would rather not receive telephone calls or text messages from us,
you may change or delete your number from your account preferences
page(s), or ask to be removed from our contact list if you receive a
call or text message from us. We fully comply with the requirements
of the U.S. CAN-SPAM Act.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Disclosure of Your Information to Third Parties</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Disclosure By Law:</em> You acknowledge and agree that we may disclose
information you provide if required to do so by law, at the request
of a third party, or if we, in our sole discretion, believe that
disclosure is 8reasonable to (1) comply with the law, requests or
orders from law enforcement, or any legal process (whether or not
such disclosure is required by applicable law) and (2) protect or
defend Lendio´s, or a third party´s, rights or property.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Disclosure to Trusted Third Parties By Us:</em> We may share and/or
sell your information with or to third parties, but only in
accordance with this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Use of
<a href="http://www.lendio.com/">www.lendio.com</a> and to fulfill your
requests for certain products and services. Your information may
also be shared with third-party contractors that provide services to
Lendio and are bound by this privacy policy. Your information will
be treated as private and confidential by such third parties and not
used for any other purpose than we authorize. In addition, from time
to time, we may share personal information (such as e-mail or
mailing address) about our user base with carefully selected third
parties, so they can offer goods and services that we believe may be
of interest to our users. If you do not wish to receive offers from
our trusted partners, you can change your e-mail preferences at any
time by following the steps outlined in the "Choice/Opt-Out" section
below.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Making Updates or Changes to Your Information; Data Retention</strong></p>

<p>You may update or remove your profile information at any time by going
to your profile page and clicking "Edit My Profile." Any changes made
will be updated immediately.</p>

<p>If you want to stop using your account you may deactivate it or delete
it. When you deactivate an account, no lender or any other third party
will have access to your account or information, but the information
will not be deleted. By deactivating your account you will have the
ability to restore the account in its entirety.</p>

<p>You may delete your account. If you choose to delete your account it
will be permanently deleted from Lendio. You should only delete your
account if you are certain you never want to reactivate it again.</p>

<p>Lendio will retain data in a commercially reasonable manner upon
deletion of an account. If an account is deleted, only Lendio will have
access to the information. No third party provider will have access to
your personal information. Lendio will only use your data for internal
research and Lendio marketing. Data that is retained by Lendio will be
retained for a commercially reasonable period of time as determined by
Lendio.</p>

<p><strong>5. Security</strong></p>

<p>We have extensive security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse
and alteration of the information stored in our database. These measures
include the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology during credit
card transactions and administrative access to site data, as well as
other proprietary security measures which are applied to all
repositories and transfers of user information. We will exercise
reasonable care in providing secure transmission of information between
your computer and our servers, but given that no information transmitted
over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure, we cannot ensure or
warrant the security of any information transmitted to us over the
Internet and hence accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure.
For further information, please see our <a href="http://www.lendio.com/legal/terms">Terms of
Use</a>.</p>

<p>In the event there is a data breach, Lendio will notify you within 45
days. We will notify you that a breach occurred, what type of
information was breached, when the breach occurred, what steps you can
follow to further protect your information, what actions we are taking
regarding the breach and what steps we are taking to ensure the breach
does not happen again.</p>

<p><strong>6. Choice/Opt-Out</strong></p>

<p>You may choose not to receive our newsletter or marketing emails prior
to receiving any such materials by checking the "No" box when prompted
at sign-up. You may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing
emails by following the unsubscribe instruction included in these emails
or you can contact us at
<a href="mailto:support@lendio.com">support@lendio.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>7. Information Obtained from Third Parties</strong></p>

<p>We purchase marketing data about our customers from third parties and
combine it with information we already have about you, to create more
tailored advertising and products.</p>

<p>If you provide information about others, or if others give us your
information, we will only use that information for the specific reason
for which it was provided to us.</p>

<p>Any information obtained from a third-party will be used to assist
matching your business with various lenders.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact
us at <a href="mailto:support@lendio.com">support@lendio.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>8. Notification of Privacy Policy Changes</strong></p>

<p>We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information
practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email
(sent to the email address specified in your account) or by means of a
notice on this Site. We encourage you to periodically review this page
for the latest information on our privacy policy.</p>
