**2\. How we collect and use information**

  * _Log Files:_ Any time you visit any of our websites, our servers automatically gather information from your browser (such as your IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks) to analyze trends, administer the site, prevent fraud, track visitor movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information. For example, we may log your IP address for system administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to track a user´s session. This gives us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not share the log files externally.

  * _Cookies:_ We use "cookies" to keep track of some types of information while you are visiting our website or using our services. Cookies are very small files placed on your computer, and they allow us to count the number of visitors to our website and distinguish repeat visitors from new visitors. They also allow us to save user preferences and track user trends. We rely on cookies for the proper operation of our website; therefore if your browser is set to reject all cookies, the website will not function properly. Users who refuse cookies assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality. We do not link the cookies to any personally identifiable information.

  * _Web Beacons:_ "Web beacons" (also known as "clear gifs" and "pixel tags") are small transparent graphic images that are often used in conjunction with cookies in order to further personalize our website for our users and to collect a limited set of information about our visitors. We may also use web beacons in email communications in order to understand the behavior of our customers. We do not link the web beacons to any personally identifiable information.

  * _Sign-Up Information:_ To process sign-ups, we may require your name, address, phone number, email address and credit card information. Such information is used primarily to process your order or as otherwise described herein. Credit card transactions are processed through industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) by a third party, which only uses your information for that purpose.

  * _E-mails and Telephone Calls:_ We require an e-mail address from you when you register for our services. We use your e-mail for both transactional (e.g., order confirmation, refund and renewal processing) and promotional (e.g., newsletters, new product offerings, special discounts, event notifications, special third-party offers) purposes. E-mail messages we send you may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the e-mails, including whether the e-mail was opened and what links (if any) were clicked. If you would rather not receive promotional e-mails from us, please see the section below labeled "Choice/Opt-Out". We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Lendio services, such as service announcements and administrative messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. We may also contact you by telephone or text message (including to any wireless number you may provide to us) solely in connection with Lendio´s services. If you would rather not receive telephone calls or text messages from us, you may change or delete your number from your account preferences page(s), or ask to be removed from our contact list if you receive a call or text message from us. We fully comply with the requirements of the U.S. CAN-SPAM Act.




**3\. Disclosure of Your Information to Third Parties**

  * _Disclosure By Law:_ You acknowledge and agree that we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law, at the request of a third party, or if we, in our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is 8reasonable to (1) comply with the law, requests or orders from law enforcement, or any legal process (whether or not such disclosure is required by applicable law) and (2) protect or defend Lendio´s, or a third party´s, rights or property.

  * _Disclosure to Trusted Third Parties By Us:_ We may share and/or sell your information with or to third parties, but only in accordance with this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Use of [www.lendio.com](http://www.lendio.com/) and to fulfill your requests for certain products and services. Your information may also be shared with third-party contractors that provide services to Lendio and are bound by this privacy policy. Your information will be treated as private and confidential by such third parties and not used for any other purpose than we authorize. In addition, from time to time, we may share personal information (such as e-mail or mailing address) about our user base with carefully selected third parties, so they can offer goods and services that we believe may be of interest to our users. If you do not wish to receive offers from our trusted partners, you can change your e-mail preferences at any time by following the steps outlined in the "Choice/Opt-Out" section below.




**4\. Making Updates or Changes to Your Information; Data Retention**

You may update or remove your profile information at any time by going to your profile page and clicking "Edit My Profile." Any changes made will be updated immediately.

If you want to stop using your account you may deactivate it or delete it. When you deactivate an account, no lender or any other third party will have access to your account or information, but the information will not be deleted. By deactivating your account you will have the ability to restore the account in its entirety.

You may delete your account. If you choose to delete your account it will be permanently deleted from Lendio. You should only delete your account if you are certain you never want to reactivate it again.

Lendio will retain data in a commercially reasonable manner upon deletion of an account. If an account is deleted, only Lendio will have access to the information. No third party provider will have access to your personal information. Lendio will only use your data for internal research and Lendio marketing. Data that is retained by Lendio will be retained for a commercially reasonable period of time as determined by Lendio.

**5\. Security**

We have extensive security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information stored in our database. These measures include the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology during credit card transactions and administrative access to site data, as well as other proprietary security measures which are applied to all repositories and transfers of user information. We will exercise reasonable care in providing secure transmission of information between your computer and our servers, but given that no information transmitted over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us over the Internet and hence accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure. For further information, please see our [Terms of Use](http://www.lendio.com/legal/terms).

In the event there is a data breach, Lendio will notify you within 45 days. We will notify you that a breach occurred, what type of information was breached, when the breach occurred, what steps you can follow to further protect your information, what actions we are taking regarding the breach and what steps we are taking to ensure the breach does not happen again.

**6\. Choice/Opt-Out**

You may choose not to receive our newsletter or marketing emails prior to receiving any such materials by checking the "No" box when prompted at sign-up. You may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instruction included in these emails or you can contact us at [support@lendio.com](mailto:support@lendio.com).

**7\. Information Obtained from Third Parties**

We purchase marketing data about our customers from third parties and combine it with information we already have about you, to create more tailored advertising and products.

If you provide information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.

Any information obtained from a third-party will be used to assist matching your business with various lenders.

If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at [support@lendio.com](mailto:support@lendio.com).
