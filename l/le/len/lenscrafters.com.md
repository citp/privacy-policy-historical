**Our Privacy Policy**

LensCrafters understands that visitors to our site may have questions about what happens with the information they provide to us. We've developed this Privacy Policy to address your potential questions. 

**When You Provide Information...**

You aren't required to register or provide information to us in order to view this LensCrafters site. 

When you use the Eyewear Consultant area of our website, we use the information you share with us to provide your customized style recommendations. 

We don't share any of the information you give us with anyone outside of LensCrafters.

**Promotions and E-mail**

Our site sometimes includes notices of promotions we are conducting, and we may permit you to register electronically in some cases. If you choose to do so, we may use the information you provide for the purpose of conducting the promotion (e.g., to e-mail coupons and information that you request). You may ask to be removed from our e-mail list at any time.

**"Cookie" Technology**

Like many companies, we use "cookie" technology on our website. We may use a temporary "session cookie" during an individual visit to our site; these temporary cookies are eliminated when you exit your browser. Another type of cookie can be stored on your computer by your browser. When you log in, this type of cookie tells us whether you've visited us before or are a new visitor. The cookie doesn't obtain any personal information about you or provide us with any way to contact you, and the cookie doesn't extract any information from your computer. We do use the cookie to help us identify site features in which you have the greatest interest, so that we can provide more of what you may want.
