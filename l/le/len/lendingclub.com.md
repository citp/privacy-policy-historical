### Security Notice

**How does Lending Club protect your personal information?**

Why?

As a financial services company, Lending Club understands that the information collected and shared with us by our borrowers and investors contains highly sensitive data with the potential to cause significant harm if it falls in the wrong hands. We take our role in safeguarding your information seriously. 

What?

We maintain a comprehensive security program based on industry standards and best practices. We take a defensive, in-depth approach to implementing rigorous physical, administrative, and technical safeguards to ensure your information is safe from unauthorized access or misuse. The safeguards include preventive, detective, and corrective controls. 

How?

Physical safeguards like access badges and a video monitoring system protect Lending Club from unauthorized access. Administrative safeguards like a security training program, employment background checks, and access controls ensure that your information is accessed only by trained and trusted staff based on business needs to provide services to you. Technical safeguards like perimeter security, industry standard encryption, two-factor authentication, and continuous monitoring ensure that your information is protected with layered and complementary controls. We review and adjust security safeguards periodically based on ongoing risk assessment. However, despite our substantial investment in protecting your personal information, ultimately no institution can guarantee its absolute security.

  


Methods of protecting your personal information  
---  
**Encryption & website certificates** | Industry standard encryption protects the information you share with us from the moment it leaves your computer until it reaches our systems. Look for the secure locked padlock on your browser, which means you are using a secure web connection. Consult your web browser documentation for more information.   
**Session time-outs** | We employ session time-outs to protect your account. You will be logged out of the website automatically after a period of inactivity. This reduces the risk of others being able to access your account if you leave your computer unattended.   
**Passwords** | You should never share your password with anyone. Your password is not known to any Lending Club employee or third party, and we will never ask for your password by phone or email. If you ever receive a communication claiming to be from Lending Club that asks for your password, you should immediately report it by contacting us at [security@lendingclub.com](mailto:security@lendingclub.com).   
**Identity theft protection** | We have developed and implemented an identity theft prevention and response program that is designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft when borrowing or investing through the Lending Club platform. We utilize authentication technology to verify the identities of our investors and borrowers, and have established processes, procedures, and training for Lending Club employees to identify and respond appropriately to identity theft red flags. Under our agreements with investors, we are obligated to repurchase loans in cases of confirmed borrower identity theft. Additionally, we will work with law enforcement authorities as appropriate to track down and prosecute anyone who has committed identity theft on the Lending Club platform.   
  
  


Disclosure of Information  
---  
**Service providers** | We work with a number of service providers who support our operations, including but not limited to, credit bureaus, collection agencies, electronic payment service providers, customer support call centers, and other nonaffiliated third parties. We share information with these third parties only to the extent necessary for us to process the transactions you initiate or to perform other specific services, like collections or identity verification. Our service providers are legally required to keep your information private and secure and adhere to applicable state and federal laws and regulations.   
**Third-party websites and services** | Additionally, we may provide you with links to third-party websites and services. Those websites and services will have different security and privacy practices, so you should review them when visiting a third-party website or using a third-party service. Lending Club is ultimately not responsible for the information practices employed by sites or services linked to or from our website. In most cases, we provide those links as a way to obtain information on products and topics that may be useful to you.   
**Questions?** | Contact us at [security@lendingclub.com](mailto:security@lendingclub.com).   
  
  


Other important information  
---  
**Correcting or deleting information** | Upon written request, Lending Club will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You can access your personal information (such as name, email address, and mailing address) that we collect online and maintain by visiting your profile in your Account Summary on our website. This section of the website is password-protected to better safeguard your information. As a registered user, you can update your password, email address, physical address, phone number, and bank account information at any time on the website, and if you need to change any other information in your profile, you can contact us at [support@lendingclub.com](mailto:support@lendingclub.com). We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. Due to the regulated nature of our industry, we are under legal requirements to retain data and are generally not able to delete consumer transactional data upon request. Certain regulations issued by state and/or federal government agencies may require us to maintain and report demographic information on the collective activities of our membership. We may also be required to maintain your personal information for at least seven years to be in compliance with applicable federal and state laws regarding recordkeeping, reporting, and audits. You may sign up to receive newsletter or other communications from us. If you would like to discontinue receiving this information, you may update your email preferences by using the **Unsubscribe** link found in emails we send to you or by contacting us at [privacy@lendingclub.com](mailto:privacy@lendingclub.com).   
**Law enforcement or other government sharing** | We may share your information with law enforcement or other government agencies as required by law. For example, to comply with a subpoena; respond to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, judicial proceedings, court order, bankruptcy proceedings, or similar legal process; or for the purposes of limiting fraud.  
**Privacy dispute resolution** | If you have a privacy or data use concern, please contact us first at [privacy@lendingclub.com](mailto:privacy@lendingclub.com).  
If we have not addressed your privacy or data use concern satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based, privacy and data usage third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>.
