  *  **Cookies and Other Automatically Collected Information.**  We collect information about your computer and your visits to our website, such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit, and page views through the use of log files. We use cookies on our website, including session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A cookie is a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored on your computer by your browser. The text file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser and load the pages according to a user’s preferences for that particular website, including the personalization of content. Cookies also enable us and our service providers to relate your use of our online services to provide you with a customized experience. More importantly, using cookies also helps us protect the security of your account. Session ID cookies follow your activities on our website so that we can ensure that no one is making changes to your profile, applying for loans or making loans on your behalf. This information is encrypted.We may send a cookie that can be stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. We may use the information we obtain from the cookie in the administration of our website, to improve its usability and for evaluating our marketing effectiveness as described above. We may also use that information to recognize your computer when you visit our website (if you select the “remember me on this computer” option), and to personalize our website for you. We may also use that information to recognize your computer and display certain marketing messages when you or someone using your computer visit(s) our website and/or other websites. Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. (For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools,” “Internet Options,” “Privacy,” and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector). However, blocking cookies can also have a negative impact on the usability of our website.Cookies may have long-term expiration dates and can stay in your hard drive for months at a time. While you can remove them as instructed by the “help” content in your chosen browser, disabling cookies will prevent you from using our website. As with many transactional websites, cookies must be enabled in order to use our website.


  *  **Information Collected by Third Parties.  **We use third-party tracking services that use cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our website. This may include page views and referral page information to track the success of our marketing efforts to bring people to our website as well as overall website performance. We use web beacons such as clear gifs, pixel tags, targeting pixels, third party pixels, or web bugs to identify users, monitor Web site traffic, and review marketing response rates. Pixel tags are one-pixel, transparent images located in an email, webpage, or other message that may be used when you are served advertisements by us or interact with advertisements you receive from third parties. Web beacons are objects embedded into web pages that allow us to determine whether and for how long users view web pages. You may stop your browser from accepting web beacons. Your browser may have add-ons that may help you block web beacons. However, you may have limited functionality if you block cookies or web beacons set by our Web site. We use these primarily to identify users, monitor Web site traffic, and review marketing response rates. No personal or sensitive information is transmitted to such advertising partners. However, third parties may use IP addresses to avoid double-counting the number of new members who joined as a result of the advertising campaign or for other purposes.We use Adobe Flash videos and applications to provide you with content including, but not limited to video clips or animation. Adobe Flash uses cookies (also called Local Shared Objects) that are similar to browser cookies but are managed using an interface different than the one provided by your browser. Flash cookies remember settings, preferences, and usage. We do not use Flash cookies to serve interest-based advertising. You may control these cookies by using Adobe’s Flash Settings Manager. Your browser may also have add-ons that may help you manage Flash cookies. You may also turn off or uninstall Adobe Flash for your web browser. However, you may not be able to use our sites fully if you block flash cookies set by our Web site or if you turn off Adobe Flash.
  *  **How LendKey responds to “Do Not Track” Signals.  **Some web browsers have a “Do Not Track” function that allows you to tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. LendKey is not currently set up to respond to these “do not track” signals.

We, our service providers, and other companies we work with may deploy and use cookies, web beacons, local shared objects, and other tracking technologies for various purposes including, but limited to, managing advertising performance, fraud prevention, and monitoring or tracking the settings of the device you use to access the products and services we offer you online. We use information we collect about you to:

  * Provide services and products you request;
  * Provide customer service;
  * Manage your relationship with us;
  * Communicate with you by email, social media, text messaging, postal mail, or telephone or through marketing messages when you or someone using your computer visit(s) our website and/or other websites about products or services we offer or are offered by third parties;
  * Enforce our terms and conditions;

  * Enable our financial services partners to implement automatic payments and fund transfers;
  * Contacting you if there is a problem completing a transaction you requested or to discuss a problem with your account; or

Certain personal information must be supplied during the registration processes, as indicated below, in order to (a) enable users to login to the website, (b) determine eligibility for loans using our proprietary credit scoring process, (c) verify your identity and the identity of any proposed cosigners, (d) establish borrowers’ ability to request loans by verifying that they are at least 18 years of age, (e) identify or guard against potential fraud, and (f) abide by anti-terrorism laws and regulations.

We may use your financial information to provide loan offers to you from Lenders or to match you with potential loans and services that you may be eligible to receive.

When you register with us and authorize or request it, we may obtain a credit report from a credit bureau to determine your creditworthiness. We will also use both your required and optional information to facilitate other activities and transactions with you. This may include assigning you a borrower credit grade based on your academic characteristics and financial information.

We use aggregated information about your computer and your visits to our website, such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit, and page views in the administration of our website to improve its usability and to evaluate the success of particular marketing/advertising campaigns, search engine optimization strategies and other marketing activities. We use non-identifying and aggregated information to help optimize our website based on the needs of our users.

We collect this information for the sole purpose of responding to such inquiries and do not store the contact information unless requested by these people, for example job applicants who submit resumes.

 **Online Advertising**  
We use Google Analytics/Tag Manager (and other third-party sites) to collect visitor data and analyze user traffic on our Web site. This helps us to understand your interests and helps us improve our Web site. Furthermore, we also use Google AdWords to advertise on third-party sites (such as Google) to display advertisements on our Web sites and across the Internet. The advertisements you see will generally be based upon the information we or our service providers and other companies we work with have about you, including information about the services and products you have with us. Where permitted by applicable law, we may share this information with others. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to our Web sites.

 **Online Behavioral Advertising**  
Online behavioral advertising (known as “OBA” or “internet-based advertising”) involves the collection of information from a computer or other device about a visitor’s web browsing activity over across non-affiliated Web sites to allow us to deliver advertisements based on that visitor’s Web site browsing history, including, but not limited to, web pages viewed, search terms used, or the manner in which you navigate a Web site. Companies we work with may place cookies on your devices and use related tracking technologies to support our OBA efforts. If you do not want your information collected and used by the companies involved in our OBA efforts, you can opt out by following the OBA Opt-Out procedure.

 **Opting Out of Online Behavioral Advertising**  
We provide three (3) ways you may opt out of OBA involving our advertisements on third-party Web sites. You may opt out through Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page (http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/) or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out platform (http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). Another way to opt out is by visiting Google’s Ad Settings and disabling Google’s use of cookies by following the instructions located at: <https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en>.
