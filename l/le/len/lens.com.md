# Privacy Policy

Our store maintains a strong commitment to your privacy. Lens.com considers the responsible use of personal information to be a critical element in enabling the Internet to reach its potential as a serious tool for personal and professional activities. As the Internet changes our lives in a number of ways, Lens.com is committed to respecting your privacy.

In general, you can visit Lens.com without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.

There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your name, home or business address and e-mail address. Lens.com will seek to let you know before we collect any personal information from you over the Internet. Some examples of when we may need information are if you choose to purchase a product directly from Lens.com Web sites, subscribe to the Info Messenger notification service, or when you register. When you choose to give us personal information over the Internet that we may request, Lens.com will endeavor to let you know how we will use this information. Lens.com will also seek to take appropriate steps to protect the information you share with us, including using appropriate technology for credit card data used in electronic commerce transactions.

When Lens.com receives information about your session or about you, we may use it for research or to improve our site and the services we offer you. We will ask you if you want us to use that information to continue contact with you by Lens.com via e-mail or other means - for example, to send you new product information or notification of special offers. If you do not want us to contact you, you can choose to "opt out," and Lens.com will endeavor to respect your wishes.

In general on Lens.com , IP addresses (the Internet address of a computer) are logged to track a user's session while the user remains anonymous. We analyze this data for certain trends and statistics, such as which parts of our site users are visiting and how long they spend there. In general, we do not link your IP addresses to anything personally identifiable to you, except in the cases of certain personalized subscription services (such as Active Answers), which utilize session data to improve the service. In those limited cases where session information is not anonymous, Lens.com will provide notice of the practice and an opportunity to "opt out."

Some Lens.com web pages use "cookies," which are small files that may be placed on your hard disk for record-keeping purposes. A cookie helps us remember who you are. It is like when someone frequently visits a certain store - the clerk may not know the customer by name, but recognizes the customer and knows some of that customer's preferences. Similarly, cookies can make your subsequent visits to the web page simpler and more seamless. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (However, by not accepting cookies, some web pages may not display properly or you may not be permitted to access certain information.)

In areas of the Lens.com Web site which may be of particular interest to children, we will use our best efforts not to collect personal information from those identifying themselves as age 17 or under. Lens.com encourages parents to take an active role in their children's use of the Internet and to spend time online with their children. Children may ask their parents to submit a request for information on their behalf.  


If you have any questions or comments about our privacy practices, would like to stop receiving information from Lens.com , or would like to correct or update information provided to Lens.com via its Web site, please contact Lens.com by sending an e-mail.
