						      <h1>Luxottica Entities Model Privacy Statement</h1>   				
					
						      <p>This Privacy Statement describes the types of information we collect from you when you visit or order products from our site, and explains what we do with that information.  This Privacy Statement is effective as of December 12, 2006 and will remain in effect until we replace it.</p><h2>Information Collection &amp; Use</h2><p>If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (including, but not limited to, name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (including, but not limited to, credit card number, expiration date, etc.).</p><p>We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.</p><p>LensCrafters, Inc. and its affiliates (defined collectively "Luxottica Retail"), are the sole owners of the information collected on LensCrafters.com. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site.</p><h2>Surveys or Contests</h2><p>From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes demographic information (such as income level and gender).</p><p>We use this information to monitor the interests and attitudes of visitors to our site and to ensure that our site provides information that is relevant and helpful.</p><p>We use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys; that company is prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose.  Other than such third party service providers, we will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p><h2>Log Files</h2><p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p><p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p><p>We use a third-party tracking service called Omniture SiteCatalyst that uses JavaScript to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate. We also use pixels, or transparent GIF files, provided by DoubleClick, to enable us to learn which advertisements bring users to our web site.  We may from time to time use other third parties for similar type tracking services.  Any information we track in this manner is anonymous, limited to usage and volume statistics, and is used to provide insight into the effectiveness of our online marketing initiatives and strategies.</p><h2>Cookies</h2><p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We may link the information we store in cookies to your personal information in order to provide a faster and more pleasant online shopping experience.</p><p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.</p><p>We set a session cookie to store your passwords, so you don't have to enter it more than once per session. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests, surveys and online shopping will be limited.</p> <p>This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers or third-party sites that may be linked to from this site.</p><h2>Communications from the Site</h2><h3>Special Offers and Updates</h3><p>If you choose to order a product from us through this site, we will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals and promotions.  You may, however, choose not to receive these types of communications at the time of your order.  Please see the section below titled "Choice and Opt-out."</p><h3>Customer Service</h3><p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.  We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.</p><h3>Profile</h3> <p>We store information that we collect through cookies, log files and third party sources to create a "profile" of your preferences.  We tie your personally identifiable information, and your purchasing history, to information in the profile, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the site for you.  We do not share your profile with third parties other than third parties that assist us in our marketing efforts and the Luxottica Companies, as described below.</p><h3>Supplementation of Information</h3> <p>In order to provide secure and convenient online ordering, we use third-party vendors, Cybersource and Accumenex, to verify your credit card information and billing address.</p><p></p><h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2><p>We are required by applicable federal and state law to maintain the privacy of your health information.  Please see our HIPAA Privacy Statement for information on our privacy practices, our legal duties, and your rights concerning your health information.  Any health information we collect from you on this site will be handled in accordance with the terms of our HIPAA Privacy Statement.</p><h3>Aggregate Information (Non-Personally Identifiable)</h3><p>We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our agents, including agencies or third-party vendors used to aggregate demographic information, provide marketing analysis and consult on advertising strategies.  This information does not identify individual users.  We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.</p><h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3><p>When you order a product from this site, or fill out a survey or contest entry on this site, we share your personally identifiable information with our affiliates and subsidiaries including, but not limited to Lenscrafters, EyeMed Vision Care, Pearle Vision, Cole, Watch Station and Sunglass Hut.  We may also share your personally identifiable information with such other affiliates or subsidiaries that we may acquire at some future time.  Collectively, we refer to these subsidiaries and affiliates as the "Luxottica Companies."</p><p>The Luxottica Companies will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals and promotions in which you might have an interest.  The Luxottica Companies' use of your information will be limited by the terms of this Privacy Statement in the same way that our use of your information is limited.  If you do not wish to receive communications from any or all of the Luxottica Companies, you may choose not to allow us to share your information with them.  Please see the section below titled "Choice and Opt-out."</p><p>Other than the Luxottica Companies, any successor entities to the Luxottica Companies, and our agents and partners, or as otherwise provided in this Privacy Statement, we do not share your personally identifiable information with third parties.</p><h3>Agents</h3><p>We use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing Luxottica Retail to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</p><p>We will also share your personally identifiable information with third parties who assist in aggregating data relating to the purchase of goods from our website, the redemption of special website offers and promotions, and other similar transactions in order to analyze trends and improve our marketing efforts.  Although the information shared with these third parties necessarily contains personally identifiable information, such personally identifiable information is not present in the reports they generate.</p><h3>Legal Disclaimer</h3><p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site</p><h2>Choice and Opt-out</h2><p>We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, or if you no longer wish to receive our promotional communications, you can indicate your preference on our email communications by simply checking the box provided to unsubscribe.</p><p>You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third-party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.</p><h2>Links to Other Sites</h2><p>This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Luxottica Retail.  Also, you may have linked to this web site from another site not owned or controlled by Luxottica Retail.  Please be aware that Luxottica Retail is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. </p><p>Be careful of disclosing any of your personally identifiable information when leaving our site.  We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.  </p><p>This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.</p> <h2>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h2><p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by contacting our Customer Support by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below or by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacyoffice@luxotticaretail.com">privacyoffice@luxotticaretail.com</a>.</p><h2>Security</h2><p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p><p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p><p>If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can email us at <a href="mailto:privacyoffice@luxotticaretail.com">privacyoffice@luxotticaretail.com</a>.</p><h2>Business Transitions</h2><p>In the event Luxottica Retail, [TM Owner] or its affiliates  goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred.  You will be notified via a prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.  You consent to the transfer of your personally identifiable information to any such successor entity unless you notify us via email to the contrary.</p><h2>Changes in this Privacy Statement</h2><p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, which is linked from the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p><p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p><h2>Contact Us</h2> <p>If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at: </p><p>Privacy Office<br>Luxottica Retail<br>4000 Luxottica Place<br>Mason, Ohio 45040<br>Phone: 513-765-4321<br>Email: <a href="mailto:privacyoffice@luxotticaretail.com">privacyoffice@luxotticaretail.com</a></p>
