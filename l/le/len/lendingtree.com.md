**More Details**

**1\. Who We Are**. When you visit a LendingTree Web site to request a loan, you will complete one simple qualification form. Based on the information you supply, LendingTree will transmit your data to participating lenders who are best suited to meet your financial needs. When you request the services of a real estate professional through a LendingTree Web site, we will transmit your data, including your credit history, to participating real estate brokers to complete your transaction. LendingTree is a computerized loan originator and is licensed or exempt as a mortgage and/or loan broker and real estate broker in most states. See our [State Licenses](https://web.archive.org/stmrc/disclosure.asp?bp=) section for additional information.

**2\. Information We Collect.**

**Information we receive from you on qualification forms.** Some of the information you supply to us on the qualification form may be optional. If you supply this information, it will not be sold or shared to or with any person or organization except: as authorized by you, to participating Lenders, real estate professionals or other parties involved in your transaction, or as may be required by law or court order.

  * **Supplementary information for your qualification form.** In order for us to match you with participating Lenders and real estate professionals, we may need to obtain additional data.

This cookie merely stores a limited amount of information about your site visit. The cookie merely tracks aggregate information on how our site is being used, including session counts, navigation patterns, pages visited, etc. These cookies, however, do not store any personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, phone number, etc. as you browse the site. These cookies cannot be related to you as an individual unless you complete a qualification form. 

When you complete a qualification form, we store your cookie identification in our system. If you request that we remember you during a qualification form, we use this cookie to allow our site to recognize you when you return. 

LendingTree also utilizes Web Logs to track aggregate information about how our site is being used. Web Logs track anonymous user information, including the number of visitors to our site, operating systems, Internet Provider addresses (if publicly available), and browser type.

  * **Information from surveys.** Every survey presented to you will include specific instructions regarding how your information may be shared. By clicking the "Submit" button at the end of the survey, you authorize LendingTree to share your data in the manner outlined on the survey.
  * **Information from the "Contact Us" section of a LendingTree Web site.** In the "Contact Us" form, we may ask you for personally identifiable information such as your name, mailing address, email address, etc. This information will not be sold to any person or organization. However, your information may be shared with other parties relevant to your transaction to help resolve any issues you report to us.
  * **Information we collect when you use LendingTree Privileges.** When you use our Privileges program, we may ask you for personally identifiable information such as your name, mailing address, email address, etc. The LendingTree Privileges is produced with partners who will only use the information to provide the Privileges services and benefits. This information will not be sold or shared with any person or organization for marketing purposes.
  * **Information gathered from Lenders.** If you are a Lender and you submit one or both of the forms requesting more information, your name and other identifying information will not be sold or shared with any person or organization. Your e-mail address or telephone number may be used by authorized LendingTree employees to contact you concerning your request.
  * **Information gathered from Real Estate brokers.** If you are a Real Estate broker and you submit the form requesting more information, your name and other identifying information will not be sold or shared with any person or organization. Your e-mail address or telephone number may be used by authorized LendingTree employees to contact you concerning your request.
  * **Information gathered from the "Affiliates" section of a LendingTree Web site.** Information submitted through the "Affiliate" section of our Web sites will be shared with BeFree, our affiliate software provider. BeFree provides the software that enables LendingTree to develop and manage our LendingTree Affiliate Program. LendingTree and BeFree do not sell or share your information with any other person or organization. 

You will receive an e-mail from LendingTree indicating whether or not you have been approved to participate in the Affiliate Program. If approved, we will use your e-mail address to inform you of Affiliate Program news and updates. You may withdraw your membership from the Affiliate Program at any time by sending an e-mail to 

[affiliates@lendingtree.com](mailto:affiliates@lendingtree.com). If you choose to withdraw, you will not receive any further e-mails regarding the Affiliate Program. If you come to a LendingTree site through an affiliate site, LendingTree will never sell or share your information with that, or any other, affiliate. All transactions take place on LendingTree's servers. Please see our [security page](https://web.archive.org/stmrc/security2.asp?bp=) for more information on how we protect the integrity of your data. 
  * **Information we collect when you apply for a job at LendingTree.** When you apply for a job through a LendingTree Web site, we may ask you for personally identifiable information such as your name, mailing address, email address, etc. This information will not be sold or shared with any person or organization. All data collected will be used for the purposes of evaluating your application for employment. Your e-mail address or telephone number may be used by authorized LendingTree employees to contact you concerning your application.



**3\. How your information is used.**

  * **Sharing information with our participating Lenders and real estate professionals.** After up to four participating Lenders and/or real estate professionals receive your information, they may contact you directly via phone, e-mail or other communications. All of our Lenders and real estate agents operate under federal and/or state laws and regulations and believe, as we do, that the Internet is an exciting and secure place to do business. If you are matched with any participating Lenders, the Lender with which you choose to close your loan and/or obtain your credit card will report certain information about your loan and/or credit card to LendingTree, and LendingTree will treat that information in the manner it treats the information you provided on your qualification form. As our Lenders and real estate professionals may keep and use your information whether or not you qualify for a transaction with them, we recommend that you contact them directly for more information about their specific privacy policies. 
  * **Sharing information with third parties.** Following is an example of how LendingTree may act as an agent for our participating Lenders and real estate professionals. A Lender may instruct us to share information with an appraiser to prepare an appraisal of the property to be mortgaged, with a flood certification provider to determine whether the property lies in a flood plain, or with a prospective secondary market purchaser of the mortgage loan the lender may make. In such situations, we will be acting on behalf of the Lender, under the authority of the Lender's privacy policy, a copy of which you will receive from the Lender. All of the information-sharing we do as agent for the Lender would be permissible under applicable federal law for the Lender to do directly. 

From time to time, LendingTree may notify you about a special offer from one of our promotional partners. At your request, LendingTree will not send you any information or offers unrelated to your request for financing. If you do not wish to receive any of these offers, please visit our 

[subscription area](https://web.archive.org/subscriptions) where you can remove yourself from our mailing list.



**4\. Altering Information You Submit Through a LendingTree Web Site.**

  * **Changing your information.** If you want to change the type of loan or make other significant changes to your qualification form, you might need to make another request through our Web site. If you wish to change your subscriptions to LendingTree emails, you can visit our [subscription page](https://web.archive.org/subscriptions).
  * **Deleting your information.** Even if your qualification form was withdrawn, by law, we cannot delete that information. We store all of the information you might provide securely. You can visit our [Security section](https://web.archive.org/stmrc/security2.asp?bp=) to learn more about how we do this.



**5\. How Our Policy is Monitored.** LendingTree is proud to hold the TRUSTe seal. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit initiative whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting TRUSTe's principles of fair information practices. Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to respecting your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices as stated above.
