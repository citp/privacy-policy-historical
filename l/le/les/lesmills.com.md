## DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION

**Service Providers**

For some of the purposes for which we use personal data (see above), we will engage a third party. If such third party needs access to personal data to carry out its task, we will share the data with them, we will ensure that the third party will only use the data based on our instructions. Such a party is a processor on our behalf and we remain responsible for your data. We will engage the following processors:

  * Companies that provide services to us (including Les Mills Companies), such as vendors, service providers, and other partners who globally support our business. These third parties provide services such as providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our services are used, measuring the effectiveness of ads and services, providing customer service, facilitating payments, or conducting academic research and surveys. These partners must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way that is consistent with this policy and the agreements we enter into with them; and
  * Analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our site. We want our site and advertising to be as relevant and interesting to you as it can be. With this in mind, we use all of the information we have about you to show you relevant ads, and in order to be able to optimize our site. We do not share information that personally identifies you (personally identifiable information is information like name or email address that can by itself be used to contact you or identifies who you are) with advertising, measurement or analytics partners unless you give us permission. We may provide these partners with information about the reach and effectiveness of their advertising without providing information that personally identifies you, or if we have aggregated the information so that it does not personally identify you.

We will make use of the personal information we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertising to that target audience;
    * social media or other similar platforms so that we can serve relevant content to you via that platform.

    * credit reference agencies for the purpose of assessing your credit score where this is a condition of us entering into a contract with you.

## UTLÄMNANDE AV DINA UPPGIFTER

**Tjänsteleverantörer**

För några av de ändamål för vilka vi använder personuppgifter (se ovan), kommer vi att engagera en tredje part. Om en sådan tredje part är i behov av tillgång till personuppgifter för att kunna fullgöra sin uppgift, kommer vi att dela data med denne, vi kommer att se till att denne tredje part endast kommer att använda denna data utifrån våra instruktioner. En sådan tredje part är ett personuppgiftsbiträde för vår räkning och vi kommer att fortsätta att ansvara för din data. Vi kommer att engagera följande personuppgiftsbiträden:

  * Företag som tillhandahåller tjänster till oss (inklusive Les Mills-företag), såsom leverantörer, tjänsteleverantörer och andra partners som stöder vår verksamhet globalt. Dessa tredje parter tillhandahåller tjänster såsom tekniska infrastrukturtjänster som analyserar hur våra tjänster används och mäter effektiviteten hos annonser och andra tjänster, tillhandahåller kundservice, ombesörjer betalningar eller genomför akademiska studier. Med dessa parter ingår vi sekretessåtaganden och de måste uppfylla sekretessåtaganden som är i linje med denna policy; och

Vi vill att vår webbplats och annonsering ska vara så relevant och intressant för dig som den kan vara.

Vi delar inte med oss av information som identifierar dig (det gäller information som namn eller e-postadress som i sig kan användas för att kontakta dig eller identifiera vem du är) genom annonsering, mätning eller analys, om du inte ger oss tillåtelse. Vi kan ge dessa parter information om deras annonserings räckvidd och effektivitet utan att ge dem information som personligen identifierar dig, eller om vi har sammanställt informationen så att den inte identifierar dig personligen.

Utöver det som anges i punkten direkt nedan, kommer vi inte lämna ut information om identifierbara individer till våra annonsörer, men vi kommer att ge dem sammanställd information om våra användare (t ex kan vi informera dem om att 500 män under 30 år har klickat på deras annons under en viss dag). Vi kommer också att använda sådan samlad information för att hjälpa annonsörer att nå den typ av publik de vill rikta sig till (t ex kvinnor med en viss postnummer).

## DÄR VI LAGRAR DINA PERSONUPPGIFTER OCH INTERNATIONELLA ÖVERFÖRINGAR

Individer (särskilt inom Europeiska ekonomiska samarbetsområdet, eller "EES") bör vara medvetna om att vi och andra tredjepartsmottagare av deras personuppgifter, såsom Les Mills-företag eller våra tjänsteleverantörer inte kommer att vara belägna inom din jurisdiktion eller inom EES. Personuppgifter kan, till exempel, komma att föras över till Nya Zeeland i anslutning till de syften som angetts ovan. Åtgärder kommer att vidtas för att skydda dina personuppgifter i överensstämmelse med gällande lag, till exempel genom att ingå avtal vars bestämmelser speglar de av EU framtagna standardavtalsklausulerna när personuppgifter avseende medborgare inom EU delas med en part utanför EES som är baserad i ett land som inte anses ha tillräckligt skydd för personuppgifter.

All information du lämnar till oss lagras på våra säkra servrar eller på säkra servrar eller säkra tjänster som kontrolleras av tredje part för vår räkning.

Kontakta oss på [info.nordic@lesmills.com](mailto:%20info.nordic@lesmills.com) för mer information om var och hur länge sina personuppgifter lagras och för mer information om dina rättigheter när det gäller radering och portabilitet.
