You hereby expressly agree that we may use the information we collect to tailor your experience on the Site, for editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for statistical analysis of users' behaviour, for product development, for content improvement and to inform advertisers or other interested parties of how may visitors have seen or clicked on the Site. Although we may publish aggregated information about usage patterns, we do not disclose information about individuals except as set out below. We do not sell information that identifies you personally. We may gather more extensive information if we believe it is necessary, for example, to address any security issues. If we think it is necessary, we can disclose information to relevant law enforcement authorities, such as the police.

LMI will not provide or release your personal information to a third party unless you have opted-in for a promotion. You agree that LMI may send you information on forthcoming promotions or services unless you have specifically opted-out of receiving such information. We provide you with a facility by which to do so.

**Retention of Information**

We may hold information you provide to us, share it with our affiliates, employees and contractors, credit reference agencies and collection agencies. This enables us to:  
provide services to you;

  * send you bills and recover money you owe to us;
  * keep you informed of services available to you from us and other people;
  * exercise any lawful right any of us has.

The Site may place a cookie on the hard drive of your computer and your browser may accept small identifying files from our system. While we recommend that you enable cookies on your browser in order to enjoy all the features of the Site, the decision remains in your hands. Note that your browser may decline the cookie if it is set up to do so, but this may limit the functionality of the Site.

**Public Forums**

We may provide you with chat features, instant messaging, message boards, community forums and/or news groups through the Online Community or otherwise. Please remember that any information that you disclose in the Online Community or other public areas of the Site will become public information, and become accessible to all other members of the Online Community and the public. We do not intend (but reserve the right) to monitor, moderate or screen the contents of user postings. We bear no responsibility for any such content and you should be cautious when considering whether to disclose your personal information in the Online Community or any public or private forums.
