# Lesson Planet - Privacy Policy

At Education Planet we strive to provide teachers, students and parents with high quality, safe educational resources, tools, services while fully respecting and protecting the privacy of our visitors and members.

**What type of information do we collect?**

**Personally Identifiable Information**  
Education Planet requests personally identifiable information from visitors registering for Lesson Planet Memberships. The information we collect for Lesson Planet Memberships includes first and last name, email address, school name and zip code. We only collect personally identifiable information from you when you voluntarily submit it. We use this information to contact you about administrative issues like scheduled membership upgrades, membership renewal reminders and membership expiration. If you allow us, this information is used to contact you with updates on new products and features as well as special promotions from Education Planet and our partners. If you allow us, we will also email you our biweekly Lesson Planet Newsletter. We do not collect any individually identifiable information on children under the age of 13.

**Personally Identifiable Information Collected by Teacher Web Tools Users**  
Education Planet's Teacher Web Tools suite of web-based applications is designed for direct use by K-12 educators and indirect use by students and parents. Lesson Planet Members using Teacher Web Tools may utilize the following web tools: TeacherSiteMaker, Online Storage, NewsletterMaker, AssignmentMaker and LessonMaker. If members use these tools, they may request personally identifiable information from their students and parents. Even though members are using Teacher Web Tools to interact with students and parents, the personal information is collected by the individual Lesson Planet Member, not by Education Planet. Any information posted using any Teacher Web Tool is the responsibility of the member and not Education Planet. Members should be aware of The Children's Olnine Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

**Add Comment & Read Comments**  
As an added value feature, all Lesson Planet Silver and Gold Members are invited (via the "Add Comments" link) to share with their teacher colleagues any helpful comments, insights or add-on activities that are specific to the lesson available for comment. Once a member's comment (and overall rating) is submitted via the "Add Comment" area it becomes available to all Lesson Planet Silver and Gold Members via the "Read Comments" link. All comments and ratings voluntarily added to the "Add Comment" area, become the property of Education Planet. Education Planet editors reserve the right to delete any comments that may not appropriately relate to the specific lesson available for comment. In order to protect the privacy of Members, when a Member contributes a lesson-specific comment via the "Add Comment" area, only the Member's first name, first initial of their last name, state (or country) and comment date will appear under their comment in the "Read Comments" area for that lesson.
