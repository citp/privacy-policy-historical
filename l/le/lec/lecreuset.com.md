### FRAUD PROTECTION

Unfortunately, some unscrupulous people may purport to represent LeCreuset.com. LeCreuset.com will request your credit card information only when you are in the checkout page of the website, or if you call our Consumer Services team to purchase a product.  
When LeCreuset.com becomes aware that someone or some company is using LeCreuset.com without our authorization, LeCreuset.com will take reasonable steps designed to stop that activity. This may take time, and it may be difficult or even impossible to stop that activity. Thus, you should take precautions to protect yourself.

You should keep your password and other Personal Information in a safe location and not share them with anyone. After you complete your visit, please log off your account and close your browser window; this should prevent someone else from accessing your account. This procedure is especially critical if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place, such as a library.

For more information on how to protect yourself, please visit the Federal Trade Commission's Website at [www.ftc.gov](http://www.ftc.gov/).
