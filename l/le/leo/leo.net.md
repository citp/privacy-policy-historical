# Welcome to Leomobile - Ringtones, wallpapers, games, Real tones

  
LEO strives to make sure that your privacy is protected any time you're using our services. You do need to give us some personal information so we're able to process your orders and requests. However, we want you to know what information we need, why we need it, and how we make sure that your information is protected. We want you to be able to enjoy your LEO experience safely and privately. 

  


### Your LEO account 

When you sign up with LEO, you establish a password-protected personal account for ordering ringtones, graphics, games and other items and services. 

  


### Information we need from you 

In order to establish your private LEO account and/or place an order, we need some personal information from you. This information may include contact information (such as name, email, cell phone number and address) and certain billing information, like a new cell phone number or change of carrier.   
We may occasionally request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and mailing address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the LEO service. 

  


### Changing your information 

To update your personal information, simply sign in and go to My Leo from your personal home page. You may also contact our Support team by writing infous@leo.net. You can make changes to your account information at any time. 

  


### E-mail notification of new LEO features and special offers

We will notify you about new features and services on LEO. We will always provide instructions to opt out from this service. We may send you site and service announcement updates with important information about the service. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements. 

  


### Sharing your information with third parties 

The personal information that you provide is an important part of our business. We are not in the business of selling this information to others. This information will only be shared with our direct partners and agents as required.

This information may be necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against anyone who may attempt to cause injury to another's rights or property.
