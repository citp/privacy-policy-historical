We collect "Non-Personal Information" and "Personal Information." Non-Personal Information includes information that cannot be used to personally identify you, such as anonymous usage data, general demographic information we may collect, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, preferences you submit and preferences that are generated based on the data you submit and number of clicks. Personal Information includes your email and other information which you submit to us through the registration process at the Site or that you provide to Recruiters or Employers via use of our Site, such as your resume and personal contact information. 

### Information collected via Technology

To access and use elements of the Service, and to post your resume on the Site or provide your resume to Recruiters and Employers via our site, you will likely need to submit Personal Information. Also, in an effort to improve the quality of the Site and the Service, we track information provided to us by your browser when you view the Site or use the Service, such as the website you came from (known as the "referring URL"), the type of browser you use, the device from which you connected to the Service, the time and date of access, and other information that does not personally identify you. We may track this information using cookies, or small text files which include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to a user's browser from our servers and are stored on the user's computer hard drive. Sending a cookie to a user's browser enables us to collect Non-Personal information about that user and keep a record of the user's preferences when utilizing our services, both on an individual and aggregate basis. 

Levo League may use both persistent and session cookies; persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your session and until you delete them, while session cookies expire when you close your browser. 

### Information you provide us by using the Service

In addition to the information provided automatically by your browser when you visit the Site, to use elements of the Service you will need to create a personal profile or purchase certain products or services. You can create a profile by registering directly through the Site and uploading your resume, a photograph, your email address and other contact information, and creating a user name and a password. If you purchase products or services, then we or our third party payment processor will also ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service.

We also permit you to designate Recruiters and Employers on our Site with whom you wish to share your Personal Information and that Personal Information is shared with the Recruiters and Employers you designate as part of our Service.

Recruiters will likely use your Personal Information to contact you and to consider you for employment; provided that submission of your Personal Information does not create any expectation or guarantee that any Recruiter and Employer will employ you based on your submission of Personal Information via our Site or our Service. 

### Non-Personal Information

In general, we use Non-Personal Information to help us operate, maintain, improve, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service and to customize the user experience. We also may aggregate Non-Personal Information in order to track trends and analyze use patterns on the Site. This Privacy Policy does not limit in any way our use or disclosure of Non-Personal Information and we reserve the right to use and disclose such Non-Personal Information to our partners, advertisers and other third parties at our discretion and for any purpose, including research and marketing purposes. 

In the event we undergo a business transaction such as a merger, reorganization, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information and Non- Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge and consent that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of our assets may continue to process your Personal Information and Non-Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If our information practices change at any time in the future, we will post the policy changes to the Site so that you may opt out of the new information practices. We suggest that you check the Site periodically if you are concerned about how your information is used.

If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which Levo League or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy. 

We implement security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access.

We further protect your information from potential security breaches by implementing certain technological security measures including encryption, firewalls and secure socket layer technology. However, these measures do not guarantee that your information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software. By using our Service, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks. 

## IV. YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

You have the right at any time to prevent us from contacting you for marketing purposes. When we send a promotional communication to a user, the user can opt out of further promotional communications by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each promotional e-mail. You can also indicate that you do not wish to receive marketing communications from us in the "Settings" section of the Site. Please note that notwithstanding the promotional preferences you indicate by either unsubscribing or opting out in the Settings section of the Site, we may continue to send you administrative emails including, for example, periodic updates to our Privacy Policy. 

## V. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES

As part of the Service, we may provide links to or compatibility with other websites or content, including the websites of Recruiters and Employers for job opportunities listed on our Site.
