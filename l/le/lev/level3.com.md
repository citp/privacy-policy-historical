### Who do we share your information with?

We make every reasonable effort to ensure that such our affiliates and business partners, including those in the U.S. and/or any other countries in which we operate, process your personally identifiable information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

We may share non-personal, non-individual information in aggregate form with other companies within our group or to carefully selected third parties.
