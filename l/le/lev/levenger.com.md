Levenger is the sole owner of the information collected on www.levenger.com. Levenger collects information from our users at several different points on our Website. 

  


1\. Information Collected

a) Personally Identifiable Information

If you request a catalog or join our e-list a user is required to give their contact information (such as name, address and email address). We use this information to send the customer a catalog and/or marketing emails. It is optional for the user to provide unique identifiers (such as, username and password), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience. We rent our customer’s mailing address with other third party catalog companies. If you wish to remove your name from third party rentals, it can be done by emailing our Customer Support at cservice@levenger.com. Or, contact us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. If you submit a comment for Add Your Review, we collect your name, email, and city/state to use as part of the testimonial for the product. We do not use your email address for marketing purposes but we may use it to contact you directly regarding your feedback. As stated on the Add Your Review page, by submitting your information and comments, you authorize us to print your name and comments as a review for the product listed. When an order is placed with us, you may be asked to provide your name, address or credit card information in connection with your use of the Website (including without limitation, by your submission of purchase orders.) This information is used for billing purposes, to fill customer orders and to send the customer a catalog.

b) Non-Personally Identifiable Information

Certain non-personally identifiable information about our visitors is collected by the standard operation of our Internet servers and through the use of cookies (small amounts of data that are sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with the Website technology, such as the type of Internet browser you are using and the domain name of your internet service provider, where you go within the Website and how much time you spend in any particular area, search queries, impressions and other data). The information we collect is (1) used to improve the content of our Website and enhance your experience, and (2) for us to contact our customers. All information that is collected is on an 'opt-in' basis and users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' at any time.

c) Third Party Cookies

Levenger has engaged a third party service provider, to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from visitors to the Website to help us administer our Website in order to constantly improve the Website quality. We do track and analyze personally identifiable usage for customers who have completed a purchase, requested a catalog or signed up for our e-list. The provider uses cookies to help track visitor behavior and Levenger sets cookies that will be listed under the domain lev.levenger.com. It does not use cookies to relate Website visitors to any personally identifiable information and provides Levenger with information about site usage that reflects individual behavior of visitors, but not their identity. All data collected by the provider on behalf of Levenger is used only to provide us with information on site usage and is not shared with any other third parties.

Levenger has an advertising contract with a service provider to serve display ads on our behalf across the Internet. The provider will collect anonymous information about your visits to our Website, and your interaction with our products and services. They may use information about your visits to this website to target advertisements for goods and services. These targeted advertisements may appear on our site or on other sites that you visit. The anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major Websites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process.   
We also partner with other third parties such as Experian to provide specific services. For example, Experian is responsible for the data processing and postal sortation for each catalog mailing. When the user signs up for these particular services, we share names and mailing address information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)

We share aggregated demographic information with our partners. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.
