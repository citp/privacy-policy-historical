BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough Corporation respect the privacy of visitors to the LEVITRA Web site. This Web site endeavors to collect, maintain, and secure your personal information in accordance with the principles described within this policy. This policy applies only to the information collected on this Web site. This privacy policy does not apply to information collected offline. Information collected online from other Web sites operated by BAYER, GSK, or Schering-Plough are governed by the privacy statements that appear on those sites.
<p>
<b>Data We Collect</b>
</p><p>
BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough will only collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address, that you provide or that is provided to us with your permission. Portions of this Web site may not ask you to supply your personal information, allowing you to visit our site without telling us who you are. However, some areas or services may require you to provide personal information in order to receive promotional offers. When you register with us, you may need to complete certain fields (some are required and some are optional). In this instance, if you choose to withhold any personally identifiable information required by us, it will not be possible for you to obtain the promotional offers.
</p><p>
In addition, BAYER, GSK, or Schering-Plough may collect non-personally identifiable information about how you use our Web sites using analysis technologies. These analysis technologies may be provided by third parties.

We use this information in the aggregate in order to better understand how to improve the quality of our Web sites.
</p><p>
<b>How We Use and Disclose Your Information</b>
</p><p>
BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough and/or the companies we hire will use this information to comply with your request for information, to contact you in connection with the promotion of LEVITRA, to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services, or as otherwise disclosed to you on the Web page when you submit your information to us. We will not sell or otherwise transfer the personally identifiable information you provide to us at this Web site to any third parties for their own use without your permission.

Like many Web sites, this Web site uses a technology called "cookies". A cookie is a small text file that a Web server gives your browser to store on your computer when you access a Web site. Cookies are capable of storing many types of data and may be placed on your browser by BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough or by a third party. Cookies may be used for a variety of purposes on this Web site:

</p><p>
—Similarly, cookies allow us to determine whether you register on or visit any of our Web sites, which enables us to analyze how particular users use our sites and whether registered and unregistered users of our Web sites use our sites differently.
</p><p>
—Cookies also allow us to maintain information about how particular visitors use our family of sites, which enables us to better provide such visitors with information relevant to their interests. This may include using information about your use of our sites in conjunction with personally identifiable information that you have volunteered to us on one of our sites.
</p><p>
This is not an exhaustive list of all uses of cookies on this Web site. In all cases in which cookies are used, however, neither BAYER, GSK, Schering-Plough, nor any third party will use the cookie to collect personally identifiable information from our site unless you voluntarily agree to enter the information. Most web browsers are set up to accept cookies. You can, however, reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.

</p><p>
Some BAYER, GSK, or Schering-Plough websites use a third-party advertising service to display advertising on other, non-BAYER, GSK, or Schering-Plough Web sites. In addition to placing advertisements on certain non-BAYER, GSK, or Schering-Plough Web pages, these services may also place a segment of code called a clear pixel tag, also known as a "GIF", on certain BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough Web pages for the purpose of measuring the effectiveness of advertisements in bringing visitors to our Web sites. GIFs may also be used with cookies to track the total number of visitors to our Web site, the number of visitors to various Web pages, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. No personally identifiable information is collected in this process.
</p><p>
As is common among Internet site operators, BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough Web sites maintain web server logs. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address and collect that information in its web server logs. BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough web server logs collect statistical data that is generated by your computer when it visits a BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough Web site, such as the type of web browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer) and operating system (Windows 95 or Mac OS) used to access the site, the domain name of your Internet service provider, the date and time you access our site, and the pages you visit. BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough Web sites use this non-personally identifying web server log information for a variety of purposes. Some of these purposes include: system administration; to examine overall traffic trends on our sites; trouble-shooting; and to gather broad demographic information about users of our sites. No personally identifiable information is contained in these web server logs.
</p><p>
<b>Confidentiality</b>
</p><p>
You should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free.

	<strong>Important Safety and Dosing Information</strong>  
	<p>LEVITRA is a prescription medicine that is used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). Men taking nitrate drugs, often used to control chest pain (also known as angina), should not take LEVITRA.  Such combinations could cause blood pressure to drop to an unsafe level.</p> 
	<p>As with all ED drugs, there is a rare risk of an erection lasting longer than four hours. To avoid long-term injury, seek immediate medical attention. LEVITRA does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. In rare instances, men taking PDE5 inhibitors (oral erectile dysfunction medicine, including LEVITRA) reported a sudden decrease or loss of vision in one or both eyes, or a sudden loss or decrease in hearing, sometimes with ringing in the ears and dizziness. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to these medicines or to other factors. If you experience any of these symptoms, stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including LEVITRA, and call a doctor right away.</p>
	<p>Discuss your medical conditions, including heart problems, and medications, including alpha blockers prescribed for prostate problems or high blood pressure, with your doctor to ensure LEVITRA is right for you and that you are healthy enough for sexual activity. LEVITRA is not recommended for men with uncontrolled high blood pressure.</p> 
	<p>The starting dose of LEVITRA is 10 mg taken no more than once per day. Your doctor will decide the dose that is right for you. In patients taking alpha blockers, your doctor may start you on a lower dose of LEVITRA. In patients taking certain medications such as ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, atazanavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin and clarithromycin, lower doses of LEVITRA are recommended, and time between doses of LEVITRA may need to be extended.</p> 
	<p>In clinical trials, the most commonly reported side effects were headache, flushing, and stuffy or runny nose. LEVITRA is available in 2.5-mg, 5-mg, 10-mg, and 20-mg tablets.</p> 
	
	<p>You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.<br><a href="http://www.fda.gov/medwatch" target="_blank">Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch</a>, or call 1-800-FDA-1088.</p><p></p><p></p>
