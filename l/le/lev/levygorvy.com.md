We may share your personal data with our group of companies, affiliates and third parties who provide us with logistics and payment processing services (set out below), only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.

We keep your information confidential, but may disclose it to our personnel, suppliers or subcontractors insofar as it is reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy. However, this is on the basis that they do not make independent use of the information and have agreed to safeguard this information.

In addition, we may disclose your information to the extent that we are required to do so by law (which may include to government bodies and law enforcement agencies); in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings; and in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention).

We may share your personal data with our selected third-party providers and suppliers for the performance of delivering our Service under the contract between you and Lévy Gorvy, including processing payments and delivering artwork to you in accordance with your instructions.

6\. DATA RETENTION**

We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant purpose and to maintain business records for tax, legal and regulatory reasons, or as otherwise described in this privacy policy.

In the context of our research and records relating to sales and ownership of artworks to assist with checks on authenticity, provenance and title, we will keep this data for as long as the record is relevant to our legitimate business interest and the public interest.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

We keep an archive, which documents artists, their practices, exhibitions and events over a number of years. All information stored in the archive is kept securely. Information in the archive is held by us indefinitely, consistent with our legitimate interest and reviewed periodically.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

 **7\. CHILDREN**

We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 18.  If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at [policyinquiries@levygorvy.com](mailto:policyinquiries@levygorvy.com). We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time.

 **8\. SECURITY**

We will take all reasonable technical and organizational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.

Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.

 **9\. CHANGES**

We will notify you of any changes to this policy by email, notice on the website or account message.

 **10\. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS**

Where we transfer your data outside of the EEA and/or Switzerland in respect of the transfer to the above affiliates, we have agreements in place with those parties which include standard data protection clauses adopted by a data protection regulator and approved by the European Commission and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your personal data. If you would like to find out more about these safeguards, please let us know by writing to [policyinquiries@levygorvy.com](mailto:policyinquiries@levygorvy.com).
