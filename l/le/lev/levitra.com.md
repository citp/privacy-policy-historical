Privacy Statement

BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough Corporation respect the privacy of visitors to the LEVITRA Web site. This Web site endeavors to collect, maintain, and secure your personal information in accordance with the principles described within this policy. This policy applies only to the information collected on this Web site. This privacy policy does not apply to information collected offline.

**Data We Collect**

BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough will only collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address, that you provide or that is provided to us with your permission. Portions of this Web site may not ask you to supply your personal information, allowing you to visit our site without telling us who you are. However, some areas or services may require you to provide personal information in order to receive promotional offers. When you register with us, you may need to complete certain fields (some are required and some are optional). In this instance, if you choose to withhold any personally identifiable information required by us, it will not be possible for you to obtain the promotional offers. 

In addition, BAYER, GSK, or Schering-Plough may collect non-personally identifiable information about how you use our Web sites using analysis technologies. These analysis technologies may be provided by third parties. Information that might be collected using these technologies includes, for example, the pages you visit on our site, the paths you take within our sites, and the length of time that you spend on our Web sites. We use this information in the aggregate in order to better understand how to improve the quality of our Web sites. 

**How We Use and Disclose Your Information**

BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough and/or the companies we hire will use this information to comply with your request for information, to contact you in connection with the promotion of LEVITRA, to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services, or as otherwise disclosed to you on the Web page when you submit your information to us.

**Cookies and Internet Tags**

Like many Web sites, this Web site uses a technology called "cookies". A cookie is a small text file that a Web server gives your browser to store on your computer when you access a Web site. Cookies are capable of storing many types of data and may be placed on your browser by BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough or by a third party. Cookies may be used for a variety of purposes on this Web site:

This may include using information about your use of our sites in conjunction with personally identifiable information that you have volunteered to us on one of our sites.

Some BAYER, GSK, or Schering-Plough websites use a third-party advertising service to display advertising on other, non-BAYER, GSK, or Schering-Plough Web sites. In addition to placing advertisements on certain non-BAYER, GSK, or Schering-Plough Web pages, these services may also place a segment of code called a clear pixel tag, also known as a "GIF", on certain BAYER, GSK, and Schering-Plough Web pages for the purpose of measuring the effectiveness of advertisements in bringing visitors to our Web sites. GIFs may also be used with cookies to track the total number of visitors to our Web site, the number of visitors to various Web pages, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. No personally identifiable information is collected in this process.

No personally identifiable information is contained in these web server logs.
