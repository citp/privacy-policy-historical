# Leftlane - Privacy

October9

Internet user privacy is of paramount importance to Leftlane and its related sites. The success of our business depends upon our ability to maintain the trust of our users. Below is information regarding Leftlane's commitment to protect the privacy of users and to ensure the integrity of the Internet.

**User Information**

During your visit to the site, Leftlane does not collect any personally-identifiable information about you that you do not specifically volunteer. This information may be volunteered when you create an account on the Leftlane comment system. However, even then, Leftlane does not use that stored information for any purpose other than to allow you to log in and post messages.

Leftlane does, however, automatically collect certain non-personally-identifiable information about you, such as your browser type and the IP address that your ISP designates to your machine. This is standard practice for Web sites, and is not used for any purpose other than to monitor traffic evaluate how we can design the site to best serve your needs. This information is not sold to any third parties, nor is it available to anyone outside of the Leftlane staff.

  
**Cookies**

Leftlane, along with thousands of other Web sites, uses cookies to enhance your experience. Cookies are used in the Leftlane comment system to keep track of your login information. Cookies can also store your user name and password so that you do not have to log in each time you want to post a message, though you must specifically request that this feature be turned on.

Cookie data is not stored on the server, and therefore, not available for viewing by Leftlane staff or any third parties. However, it is possible that security flaws exist in some browsers that would allow other site administrators to write malicious scripts that would collect this data without Leftlane's knowledge, though this is quite unlikely. 

**Third-party Ad Server**

A portion of the advertisements displayed on the Leftlane Network are served by third-party advertisers, including Google, FastClick, and other sites. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.  


We are committed to continuing to protect the privacy of our readers.If you have any additional questions, please contact us. 

We recommend that you review this Privacy Statement periodically, as Leftlane may update it from time to time without notice to its users.
