# Privacy Policy

Internet user privacy is of paramount importance to Leftlane.com and its related sites. The success of our business depends upon our ability to maintain the trust of our users. Below is information regarding Leftlane’s commitment to protect the privacy of users and to ensure the integrity of the Internet.

**User Information**

During your visit to the site, Leftlane does not collect any personally-identifiable information about you that you do not specifically volunteer. This information may be volunteered when you create an account with Leftlane or request a vehicle price quote. In the case of accounts with Leftlane, this data is only used to allow you to login and post comments. In the case of vehicle price quotes, the data is passed along to car dealerships in your area, and might be stored by Leftlane or its price quote partners for statistical analysis only.

Leftlane does automatically collect certain non-personally-identifiable information about you, such as your browser type, screen resolution, java and flash version, operating system, and the IP address that your Internet Service Provider designates to your machine. Your IP address can be used to determine the physical location of your Internet Service Provider, which is usually the city from which you are accessing the Web. All the aforementioned non-personally-identifiable information is used to optimize the website for display on your computer, and sometimes target certain types of on-site advertising to users in a specific geological location.

This information is not sold to any third parties for their independent use. Any data collected by Leftlane and provided to third parties is used to optimize advertising campaigns on the website itself. You will not be sent advertising in the form of emails, paper mail, or telephone calls.

**Cookies**

Leftlane, along with thousands of other Web sites, uses cookies to enhance your experience. Cookies are used in the Leftlane discussion area to store your user name and password so that you do not have to log in each time you want to post a message. 

Cookie data is not stored on the server, and therefore, not available for viewing by Leftlane staff or any third parties. However, it is possible that security flaws exist in some browsers that would allow other sites to write malicious scripts that would collect this data without Leftlane’s knowledge, though this is quite unlikely.

**Third-party Ads**

A portion of the advertisements displayed on the Leftlane Network are served by third-party ad networks. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by MAXOnline, please [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp "click here").

We are committed to continuing to protect the privacy of our readers. If you have any additional questions, please contact us at privacy@leftlanenews.com. 

We recommend that you review this Privacy Statement periodically, as Leftlane may update it from time to time without notice to its users.
