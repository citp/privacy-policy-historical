This Policy describes Lexus Financial Services' policy regarding information received about you during visits to our website.  
  
 **Normal Website Usage**  
  
You can visit Lexus Financial Services' website to read product, investment, and company information, or use some of our online tools (e.g., What's Right for Me? and Payment Estimator) without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. During these types of visits, we collect and store statistical information on an anonymous basis, such as the information about the time and length of your visit, the website you last visited, the pages you request, and the date and time of those requests. We may also collect and store the name of your Internet Service Provider.

We use cookies when you enter our website to help us gather this type of statistical information. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record keeping purposes so that we can track website and user activity. The use of cookies is an industry standard and you will find them at most websites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, if you do so, some parts of our website may not work properly for you.

We also use cookies to trigger certain online customer service surveys, which could be hosted on a site other than this site. These surveys are completely anonymous and optional. The information that LFS and any outside survey company obtain from you if you choose to fill out these surveys is used only to improve your experience in visiting the LFS website.

There are instances where we request personally identifiable information to provide our website visitors a service or correspondence (e.g., promotions and mailed brochures).

If you are our customer, the information may also be shared as described below.

We also collect information from consumer reporting agencies, but we do not disclose personally identifiable consumer report information to any third parties, including our affiliates, except as permitted by law.
