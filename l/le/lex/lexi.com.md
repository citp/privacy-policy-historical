# Privacy Statement | Clinical Drug Information

This Privacy Statement relates solely to the online information collection and use practices of our website located at www.wolterskluwercdi.com. We recognize that many visitors and users of this Website are concerned about the information they provide to us, and how we treat that information. This Privacy Statement, which may be updated from time to time at Wolters Kluwer Clinical Drug Information's sole discretion, has been developed to address those concerns.

By your use of this Website you explicitly warrant to Wolters Kluwer Clinical Drug Information that you have read and that you accept our privacy practices, as outlined in this Privacy Statement. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Statement, please contact us.

## What information about you do we collect?

When you visit our Website, you may provide us with two types of information: (1) personally identifiable information that you knowingly choose to disclose, which is collected on an individual basis, and (2) general user information which is collected on an aggregate basis as you browse this Website.

### (1) Personally Identifiable Information You Choose to Provide

We may ask for certain personal information from you for the purpose of providing to you content and/or services that you request. For example, if you indicate an interest in receiving ongoing information about Wolters Kluwer Clinical Drug Information, you are asked to submit your e-mail address, which we retain on file so we may send you the information that you requested. We also request your name and e-mail address and other information that helps us understand your needs each time you contact us through online forms. At our option, we may retain a record of users who have contacted us in order to respond properly to questions or concerns and for purposes of future communications.

### (2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information We Collect

Similar to other commercial websites, our Website utilizes standard technology called "cookies" and Web server logs to collect information about how our Website is used. Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the computer used to access a web site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's web browser on the user's hard drive. Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Website, and the websites visited just before and just after our Website. This information will be collected on an aggregate basis.

Should you decide, you can, of course, disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of our Website will not operate correctly if you disable cookies. You should consult with your browser's provider/manufacturer if you have any questions regarding disabling cookies.

## How do we use the information we collect?

We use your personally identifiable information to provide you with the information or content that you have requested, and, in some cases, to contact you about our programs, products, features, or services. If you no longer wish to receive press releases or any other type of information from us, you must [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact/).

We use non-identifying information collected on our Website in the aggregate to better understand the use of the Website and to enhance your experience. For example, we may use the information to improve the design and content of our Website or to analyze the programs and services that we offer.

We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. We will use our all reasonable efforts to ensure that our employees, agents, and contractors who have access to personally identifiable information protect the information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Statement.

We reserve the right to provide access to your personally identifiable information when legally required to do so, to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Website, to limit our legal liability and protect our rights, or to protect the rights and safety of visitors to this Website or the public. In those instances, the information will be provided only for that limited purpose.

We will not share your personally identifiable information in ways unrelated to those described in this Privacy Statement without providing you with an opportunity to opt out of such use or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

## How do you access and/or modify your information or choices?

If you visit our Website and volunteer personally identifiable information, you may modify, update, or delete such information at any time by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/contact/). In addition, please be aware that your ability to opt out from receiving marketing and promotional materials does not change our right to contact you regarding your use of our Website.

## Privacy Protection for Children Using the Internet

Protecting children's privacy is important to us. For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information on our Website from those we actually know are under the age of 13, nor is any part of our Website targeted to attract anyone under 13. We request that all visitors to our Website who are under 13 not disclose or provide any personally identifiable information. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete that child's personally identifiable information from our records.
