# The Lexile Framework for Reading

This statement is effective as of 7/1/04. 

**Overview**  
At MetaMetrics, we respect the privacy needs of our valued customers and subscribers. This Privacy Policy outlines what specific information is gathered on the MetaMetrics site and how that information is used. 

MetaMetrics works to ensure highest degree of protection for consumers and businesses. In fact, our standards meet (and exceed) the U.S. Department of Commerce's "Safe Harbors" standards. We will continue to work to ensure that our Web site complies with strict standards for online privacy, security, business practices, transaction integrity and availability. If you have any specific questions about the MetaMetrics Privacy Statement, please contact us via e-mail at [webmaster@lexile.com](mailto:webmaster@lexile.com?subject=MetaMetrics%27%20Privacy%20Policy). 

**Collection and Use of Information by MetaMetrics**  
MetaMetrics explicitly asks when we need information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). Your personal information is used to create your personal access to products on the site, and to contact you in the course of using the products. Financial information that is collected is used to verify identity, and to bill either you or your company for products and services, as applicable. Demographic and profile data collected by MetaMetrics may be used to tailor the Web site or any requested e-mail communications, and to display information that is more relevant to you. 

Your e-mail address is used to only send you information that you have requested. As part of your use of any MetaMetrics product or service, MetaMetrics allows you to elect to receive, or not receive, certain information from MetaMetrics. MetaMetrics adheres strictly to permission-based e-mail policy and complies with all provisions of the Federal CAN-SPAM Act. MetaMetrics will not sell, rent or loan the personal information in our contact lists or our business partners' contact lists (including customer data) to any outside firms without your permission to share your personal information. All e-mails that you have requested will have an option to unsubscribe. Unsubscribe requests are fulfilled with no further communication sent to users who have stated that they do not wish to receive the specified information. 

While IP addresses (address of a computer) are logged to track a user's session, the user's identity is anonymous. Tracking IP addresses gives MetaMetrics information about which parts of our site are used most often and what information is viewed. IP addresses are not linked to anything that can personally identify a visitor. Thus, session details are tracked, but the user is anonymous. 

**Information Use by Third Parties**  
It is MetaMetrics' policy to never provide your personal information to third parties without your express permission or only in instances where such disclosure is necessary to process payment transactions or provide services that you have requested. We generally do not release personal information about you as an individual. There are two exceptions to this policy. One: if MetaMetrics is compelled to do so by an appropriately empowered governmental authority. Two: if MetaMetrics makes the MetaMetrics technology or services available to you through its business partners. MetaMetrics will not share with them any more information than is necessary to perform the transaction you have requested. Where you have purchased our services through a MetaMetrics partner, we may provide customer name and business volume information to the partner. We may also share your personal information with a business partner if you have explicitly agreed to opt-in to communications from a partner. 

**Contact Lists, Campaign Content and Campaign Reports**  
MetaMetrics ensures that all contact lists, e-mail content and reports remain private and confidential. Any use of MetaMetrics systems must be in compliance with our Acceptable Use Policy -- to protect against inappropriate use (illegal, abusive, obscene, threatening, etc.). 

**Information Exchanges and Transactions**  
Privacy, anti-hacking and other security technology has been implemented throughout our application system. Information exchanges and transactions, passwords, contact lists (uploading and storing online) and billing related data between you and our application system are protected using various technologies. This ensures a high degree of security. 

**Credit Card Information**  
MetaMetrics allows you to purchase Lexile-related products and services in a variety of ways. When credit card billing is chosen, information is transferred to MetaMetrics' clearing house partner using industry-leading, secure transmission technology including SSL and HTTPS (the transmission standard used for transactions by major financial institutions). The information is then encrypted using data encryption and stored securely so that it is ready to handle your transactions. 

**The Bottom Line**  
Maintaining the privacy of your information is of paramount importance to us as it helps foster confidence, goodwill and stronger relationships with you, our customers. If, at any time, you have questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please feel free contact us at [webmaster@lexile.com](mailto:webmaster@lexile.com?subject=MetaMetrics%27%20Privacy%20Policy).
