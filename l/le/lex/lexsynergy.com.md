**2\. The data we collect about you**

Personal data (or personal information) means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified.  It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).

We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together follows: 

  * **Identity Data** includes first name, last name, username.

  * **Technical Data  **includes internet protocol (IP) address, browser type and version.
  * **Profile Data** includes your username and password, purchases or orders made by you (including where acting on behalf of a third party – e.g. your employer), feedback and other correspondence (e.g. requests for technical assistance) and instructions (e.g. in relation to cases on which we might work for you or your employer).
  * **Audit Data** includes information about the pages you visit on our website and how you use our website and services.
  * **Marketing and Communications Data** includes your preferences for receiving email marketing from us.



We also collect, use and share **Aggregated Data** (such as statistical data) for any purpose.  Aggregated Data is not considered personal data in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity.  We will not combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data.  We collect this personal data by using cookies. ** _ _** Please see the cookies section of the ‘how we use you personal data’ area of this policy for further details.

We do not collect any **special categories of personal data** about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data).  Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.

**If you fail to provide personal data**

Where we need to collect personal data by law or under the terms of an Agreement we have with you (or your employer, for example) and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the Agreement we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with services).  In this case, we may have to cancel a service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.

**3\. WHOIS, TMCH & SSL data**

Lexsynergy also acts on behalf of other controllers (and on their instructions) in relation to certain personal data which we may collect from you, namely: (a) ‘ICANN’ (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, incorporated and registered in California, USA) and/or domain name registries; (b) the ‘Trademark Clearinghouse’ (Chip S.A., incorporated and registered in Luxembourg with number B62506, whose registered office is at 21, rue Léon Laval, 3372 Leudelange); and (c) our chosen SSL certificate provider from time to time.  We may provide your personal data (or that of anyone else which you provide to us) to these third parties on (respectively): (a) your application to register a domain; (b) your application to register with the Trademark Clearinghouse; or (c) your application for an SSL certificate.  When we do so, we are acting as a ‘processor’.

We only have limited obligations to you (or the person whose personal information you have given us) in relation to this personal data (because we are only acting as a processor).  However, in order to be as transparent as possible, we have described these situations in more depth in our WHOIS, TMCH and SSL Guidance.

**4\. How is your personal data collected?**

We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:

  * **Direct interactions.**   You may give us your Identity, Contact, Financial and Marketing and Communications Data by filling in forms or by corresponding with us by post, phone, email or otherwise.  This includes personal data you provide when you:

  * where we need to perform the Agreement we are about to enter into or have entered into with you;
  * where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests; and
  * where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.



See the Glossary to find out more about the types of lawful basis that we will rely on to process your personal data.

Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in relation to sending direct marketing communications to you via email.  You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us at [_http://www.lexsynergy.com/contact-lexsynergy_](http://www.lexsynergy.com/contact-lexsynergy).

**Change of purpose**

We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.  If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

**6\. Disclosures of your personal data**

We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above.

  * Internal Third Parties (members of the Lexsynergy group) as set out in the Glossary.
  * External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.



We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.  We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

**7\. International transfers**

We share your personal data within the Lexsynergy group.  This will involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area ( **EEA** ).  Furthermore, many of our external third parties are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it as within the EEA by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

  * transferring your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.  For further details, see [ European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en);
  * for certain service providers, we may use specific Agreements approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.  For further details, see [ European Commission: Model Agreements for the transfer of personal data to third countries](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en); 
  * for providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.  For further details, see [ European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en).



Please [contact us](http://www.lexsynergy.com/contact-lexsynergy) if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.

**8\. Data security**

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.  In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.  They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of any (suspected) breach where we are legally required to do so.

**9\. Data retention**

**How long will you use my personal data for?**

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for (including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements).

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means as well as the applicable legal requirements.

Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are set out below.

**Type of Data**

**What we may need from you**

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).  This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.  We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

**Time limit to respond**

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.  Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.  In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

**11\. Glossary**

**LAWFUL BASIS**

**Legitimate Interest** means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience.  We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests.  We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).  You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.

**Performance of Agreement** means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of an Agreement to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such an Agreement.

**YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS**

You have the right to:

**Request access** to your personal data (commonly known as a ‘data subject access request’).  This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

**Request correction** of the personal data that we hold about you.  This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

**Request erasure** of your personal data.  This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.  You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.  Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

**Object to processing** of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.  You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.  In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

**Request restriction of processing** of your personal data.  This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

**Request the transfer** of your personal data to you or to a third party.  We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.  Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform an Agreement with you.

**Withdraw consent at any time** where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.  However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.  If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.  We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

We use cookies to provide you with a seamless user experience. By continuing we assume you agree with our [cookie policy in our Privacy Notice](https://web.archive.org/privacy-policy).
