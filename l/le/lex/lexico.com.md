This Privacy Policy describes the online privacy practices applicable to the web pages within Dictionary.com, Reference.com and Thesaurus.com (the " **Sites** ") and the various services (" **Services** ") we provide on or through the Sites.

### Information we collect when you visit the Sites

**Information we automatically collect** : Each time you visit one of the Sites, we collect the limited information that your browser makes available whenever you visit any website, including: (a) your Internet Protocol (IP) address; (b) the address of the last URL you visited prior to clicking through to the Site; (c) your browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform); (d) your browser language; and (e) the data in any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us, which may include the word look-ups you previously submitted, Site pages you previously visited and your interaction with the advertising on the Sites (see "Dictionary.com cookies" below).

Additionally, when you enter a search query or word look-up using the Sites or Services, we will receive the query text and process it, together with the above data, to return a results page to you. We disassociate your query text data from your IP address and your unique cookie ID (see "Dictionary.com cookies" below) after a period of 18 months, except in limited circumstances, such as requests to retain the information by law enforcement.

**Registration Information** : If you decide to purchase Dictionary.com Premium Services or subscribe to other additional services such as receiving the Word of the Day messages, we may ask you to submit certain identifying information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number and, for paid services, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). We also may request information about your interests and activities, your gender and age, and other demographic information. You may also decide to give us your email address or cell phone number to receive certain communications from us such as Word of the Day emails or SMS messages. If we run a promotion or sweepstakes to promote our services, we may collect some personally identifiable information to verify your eligibility to participate and to contact you to deliver prizes.

### Use of cookies and other technologies

**Dictionary.com cookies** : When you visit the Sites, we may assign your computer one or more cookies to facilitate access to our site and to personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record keeping purposes. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Our cookies expire after two years, and all information from expired cookies is automatically deleted from our servers. You may disable or remove our cookies at any time (see "How to decline or delete cookies" below).

We use cookies for various purposes:

  * We count, track, and aggregate our visitors' activities in our analysis of general traffic flows at the Sites (e.g., tracking where users come from, what pages they select within the Sites, how they interact with search results, etc.) to facilitate evaluation, improvement, and development of the Sites and Services and also for internal reporting purposes and optimization of advertising revenue.
  * We collect information about your online activity on the Sites, such as the web pages you visit, links you click, searches and word look-ups you conduct and how you interact with ads on the Sites, in order to customize your experience on the Sites including the advertisements that we display to you;
  * We use a cookie to determine whether or not you are signed in as a Premium Services subscriber



Our cookies contain an anonymous unique identifier (usually in the form of a serial number). If you are a registered user for Premium Services, when you sign in to your account on our Sites, we will record your user or member ID and the name on your user or member account in the cookie file on your computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for automatic sign-in. For security purposes, we will encrypt any usernames, passwords, and other user or member account-related data that we store in such cookies.

**Other technologies used by Dictionary.com** : We may use standard Internet technology, such as pixel tags, web beacons and other similar technologies to track your use of the Site. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email). We also may include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer, to deliver targeted advertisements and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising or other Services.

**Third-party advertising company cookies** : We use third-party companies to serve advertisements when you visit the Sites. In the course of serving advertisements on the Sites, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as pixel tags in connection with the Sites. We allow certain third-party advertising networks who sell ads on the Sites to use cookies, pixel tags and similar technology to collect information about your interactions with the Sites, such as the queries or word look-ups you submit, the pages you view, the advertisements you view and your interactions with such advertisements. The third-party advertising networks may then use such information about you to draw inferences about your interests and display advertisements matched to those interests. Through cookies placed on your computer, third-party advertising networks may recognize you when you visit other sites and properties where they also place advertisements. You may receive customized advertisements on the Sites and on other sites with advertising managed by the same third-party advertising networks.

Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that a third-party ad-serving company might collect from you. These companies have their own recordkeeping and data-retention policies. Most of our advertising service providers are members of the Network Advertising Initiative. If you would like to consider your options for limiting use of such information by these advertising companies, or would like to learn more about their practices, please consult the Network Advertising Initiative website at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/>.

If you decide to purchase the Premium Services from us, you will receive the Services ad-free, and starting on the day you are registered as a Premium Service user, no additional third- party advertising company cookies will be placed on your computer.

**Cookies from other service providers** : We also use third-party vendors to help us better understand our user demographics. These vendors may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer or use other technologies such as pixel tags in connection with the Sites to provide their services to us. Some of the games available on the Site are also provided by third parties and such third parties may place a flash cookie on your computer to enable you to play the game. 

**How to decline or delete cookies** : Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in or use some of the interactive features offered on the Sites. The "Help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Click "Help" in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions. You may also "opt out" of targeted advertising delivered by Network Advertising Initiative member ad networks by visiting <http://www.networkadvertising.org/> and clicking on "Consumer Opt Out". 

Some advertising service companies also use flash cookies to serve advertisements that use flash media technology. Adobe offers a web tool that runs locally on a user’s computer, and allows users to delete flash cookies, as well as set permissions for sites to drop and store cookies on the user’s computer. The tool can be found at <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager06.html> and <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html>

We may include advertisements in the emails that you receive from us (such as the Word of the Day emails).If you are receiving email from us in response to an inquiry you made, we will use your email address for no purpose other than to respond to your inquiry.

We may also share your cell phone number with trusted third parties for them to send you advertisements and promotional offers that we think may be of interest to you. In order to stop receiving SMS messages from us, you may text STOP to 44636. 

### Information we share with third parties

**Service Providers** : We may share your information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services include processing credit card payments, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting our website functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through the Sites. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share this information with others or use it for any other purposes. These third-party companies have their own policies as to record keeping and data retention.

**Advertising Service Providers** : Some elements on the Sites, such as the sponsored links advertising on our pages, are supplied to us by third parties under contract. We may supply some of the information we collect from you to those third parties so that they can provide those elements for display on the Sites. We may share the following information with such third parties: (a) your Internet Protocol (IP) address; (b) the address of the last URL you visited prior to clicking through to the Site; (c) your browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform); (d) your browser language; (e) the data in any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us; and (f) the search queries or word look-ups you submit. For example, when you submit a query, we transmit it (and some of the related information described above) to our paid listing providers in order to obtain relevant advertising to display in response to your query or look-up.

Except as indicated above, Dictionary.com shares your personally identifiable information only in aggregate form, so that only non-personally identifiable information is shared with our affiliates, advertisers and business partners. We do not share any information that identifies specific visitors. 

### Security precautions to protect your information

We have security measures in place that are designed to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access to information we collect through the Sites and Services. Dictionary.com utilizes both industry and proprietary standards to preserve the confidentiality of information. We seek to limit access to our users’ information to employees who we believe reasonably need access to that information to provide products or services to you or in order to perform their jobs. These employees have been informed of the need to maintain the security and confidentiality of such information. Unfortunately, no security system can be 100% secure; accordingly, we cannot fully guarantee the security of the information that we collect online.

### Children's Guidelines

The Sites meet the guidelines of [TRUSTe's](http://dictionary.reference.com/go/http://www.truste.org/) Children's Program.  
 **We DO NOT** :

  * collect contact information without prior parental consent or parental notification, which will include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity.

### Law Enforcement/Legal Requirements

We may disclose your personally identifiable information as well as your IP address and other information in order to comply with court orders, subpoenas, or regulatory obligations, or when otherwise required to do so by law. We also may disclose such information in compliance with a law enforcement or other governmental request, or where we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of our [Terms of Use.](http://dictionary.reference.com/help/terms.html)
