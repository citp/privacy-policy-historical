## How We Use Your Information

Lexmark collects and uses your personal information to operate and improve its sites, to fulfill your requests for information, to register your products, to process your job application, to provide you promotional materials, to allow you to participate in contests and surveys, to provide service and support, and to carry out the transactions you have requested. These uses may include providing you with more effective customer service; making the sites or services easier to use by eliminating the need for you repeatedly to enter the same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and solutions; and displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences.

We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and support announcements. Some Lexmark services may send periodic member letters that are considered part of the service. We may also contact you to inform you of products or services available from Lexmark and its affiliates.

Personal information collected online may be combined with information you provide Lexmark in other ways, such as through product registrations, service calls, Lexmark Connect, or trade shows.

## How We Share Your Information

Lexmark keeps your personal information confidential. We will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others. Unless we have your permission, we will not use or share your personal information in ways unrelated to the ones described at the time you provide the data. Lexmark engages service providers and suppliers ("agents") to perform certain functions on Lexmark's behalf. For example, these agents may deliver products to you, provide product service and support, maintain Lexmark information technology systems, and assist Lexmark with marketing and communication initiatives. Those agents will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to perform the services. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information received on Lexmark's behalf and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.

Some Lexmark products may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register products, both Lexmark and the other company may receive the information you provide.

The Lexmark Online Store is owned and managed by a third party and is subject to a separate privacy policy. This statement does not apply to the Online Store.

We may access and/or disclose your personal information if we believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on Lexmark; (b) comply with requests for information from police or government authorities, (c) protect and defend the rights or property of Lexmark (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (d) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Lexmark employees or members of the public.

Lexmark or its affiliates could merge with or be acquired by another business or their respective assets may be acquired. Lexmark will seek appropriate protection for personal information in these types of transactions.

## Your Choices

Lexmark offers you the opportunity to choose whether your personal information is (a) to be disclosed to a non-agent third party or (b) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. Lexmark will provide you reasonable mechanisms to exercise your choices at the data collection point or by using other methods.

These choices are not applicable to communications from Lexmark primarily for the purpose of administering orders, contracts, support, product safety and security warnings, software updates, or other administrative and transactional notices.

## Keeping Your Personal Information Secure

To protect against unauthorized access, misuse, disclosure, or alteration of your personal information, Lexmark employs appropriate physical, technical, and administrative measures. Physical security is designed to prevent unauthorized access to database equipment and hard copies of documents. Electronic security measures, such as firewalls, access restrictions, and encryption provide protection from hacking or other unauthorized access.
