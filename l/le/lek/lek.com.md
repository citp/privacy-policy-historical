### 4\. How we use your personal data

L.E.K. Consulting will only use your personal data when the laws of the jurisdiction of specific L.E.K. Consulting entity allow. Most commonly, we will use your personal data where L.E.K. Consulting has a legitimate interest in, or other legal basis for, processing your information, including where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation or in relation to legal claims. We may also process your personal data where we have your consent to process your personal information and, when we rely on your consent for the processing, you may withdraw such consent at any time. Other lawful basis for us processing your data may be that such processing is necessary for the performance of a contract we have entered or at your request are entering with you. However, please note that where we have relied on more than one legal basis for processing, we may continue the processing without your consent.

The information we collect from you may be used to improve the content of our Website, to fulfill your requests for information, provide services and marketing information to you, recruit and evaluate job applicants and otherwise communicate with you, and to serve the appropriate region data to you. We may also keep your personal data and use it to contact you in the future.

These third-party service providers include, dotMailer, HubSpot, Grove Marketing, Google Analytics, New Relic and AddThis who assist us in maintaining our Website, analyzing our Website traffic, and in providing services and information to users of our Website. We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with applicable law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

With respect to Ad Servers: we do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies.

L.E.K. Consulting reserves the right to disclose your information where required by law or to comply with valid legal or regulatory processes to protect L.E.K. Consulting’s rights.

In addition, we may also disclose your personal data to third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets, or alternatively, if we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners, or combined group, may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this Privacy Notice, otherwise you will be notified of any change by an updated privacy notice on this Website. With regard to personal data processed in connection with our recruitment activities and information on the use of personal data provided on our online application system, please see our online application system and [Recruitment Notice](https://web.archive.org/gdpr-privacy-notice-recruitment).

The information collected may also be shared within the L.E.K. Consulting Group companies on a global basis and globally with third parties who may be providing services to any L.E.K. Consulting company. Those countries may not provide an adequate level of protection in relation to the processing of personal data but, in connection with the processing of personal data to which GDPR applies where required by law, we have put in place legal mechanisms designed to ensure adequate data protection. Such mechanisms include the [EU Model Clauses](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en) and the use of [European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en) contracts. For transfers within L.E.K. Consulting Group of companies, we ensure each office complies with our internal policies on personal data.

### 8\. Data security

L.E.K. Consulting has put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. For the processing of data subject to GDPR, they will only process your personal data on our instructions and where they are subject to a duty of confidentiality, and we will also deal with personal data breaches and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. In the EU, the relevant authority is the UK’s [Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)](http://www.ico.org.uk/).

Despite these precautions, L.E.K. Consulting cannot guarantee the security of the information collected from third parties or transmitted through our Website or guarantee the security of emails. Therefore, we assume no liability for any disclosure of information collected arising from the acts of third parties or other events, acts or omissions outside of our control, including, but not limited to, interruption of service or any issues related to the use of the internet.

### 9\. Data retention

L.E.K. Consulting will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including, where applicable, for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means and the applicable legal requirements.

Details of retention periods applied to your personal data can be requested by [contacting us](mailto:dataprivacymanager@lek.com). For data subjects protected by GDPR we keep basic information about you for six years after you cease to use our services or hold other communication with us. Personal information collected in relation to money laudering requirements will be kept for up to 10 years. In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete your data: see request erasure below for further information.

We may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

As a user of the alumni section of our Website you also agree to the use of cookies to help you access the site and to remember your preferences and settings as outlined above.

### 12\. Your legal rights

Under local data protection laws, you may have rights in relation to your personal data. In the processing of your personal data, certain of your rights are protected by the GDPR, and these rights will include the right to:

  * **Request access** to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it  
 
  * **Request correction** of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us  
 
  * **Request erasure** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request  
 
  * **Object to processing** of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms  
 
  * **Request restriction of processing** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it  
 
  * **Request the transfer** of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you  
 
  * **Withdraw consent** at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent



If you are protected by GDPR and wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please [contact us](mailto:dataprivacymanager@lek.com). However, there are circumstances in which those rights may not be available to you and we may not satisfy your request.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data or to exercise any of the other rights, where these rights apply in our processing of your personal data. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

In addition, where granted by local law, you may also have the right to make a complaint at any time to the relevant data protection authority. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach any authority so please contact us in the first instance.

### 13\. Your California privacy rights

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of the Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  To make such a request, please send an e-mail to [info@lek.com](mailto:info@lek.comn) or write us at:
