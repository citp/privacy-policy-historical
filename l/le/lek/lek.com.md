# L.E.K. Consulting Privacy Policy | L.E.K. Consulting

**Information Regarding Fraudulent Job Postings and Check Fraud Scam**  
Certain individuals using various names and non-L.E.K. Consulting identities have been posting or sending fraudulent job offers through various non-L.E.K. Consulting email addresses, including through @mail.com and @ftifirm.com addresses.  Certain individuals have also fraudulently used the identities of individuals affiliated with L.E.K. Consulting, and have sent checks fraudulently using the L.E.K. Consulting name.  These individuals are not authorized to act on behalf of L.E.K. Consulting and they are not affiliated with L.E.K. Consulting.  If you have received correspondence that is fraudulent, L.E.K. Consulting suggests that you contact your local authorities.

L.E.K. Consulting LLC (together with its global associated offices, “L.E.K. Consulting”, “we”, “us” or “our”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your privacy through this policy. This policy applies to the [www.lek.com](http://www.lek.com/) website (the “Website”) and describes the types of personal identifying information we may collect from you when you visit the Website and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining and disclosing that information.

By accessing the Website, you agree to this privacy policy. This policy is subject to change from time to time, and your continued use of the Website after such changes are made is considered to be your acceptance of those changes.

The information collected may also be shared within the L.E.K. Consulting companies on a global basis and globally with third parties who may be providing services to any L.E.K. Consulting company.
