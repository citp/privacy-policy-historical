We, Lemonade, Inc., and our corporate affiliates ("we" or "us"), highly value and respect your privacy. This privacy policy ("Policy") outlines which information we collect when you ("you" or "your") access and use the website, mobile application (the "App"), products and services provided by us (which, together, are referred to as the "Services"), and how we protect and use it. The Policy also wishes to make sure that you are aware of the options available to you when you access and use our Services. 

Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the Policy before using our Services. Feel free to email us to help@lemonade.com if you have any questions.

**Protection of Children’s Privacy**

IF YOU ARE UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER. 

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, we do not knowingly collect or maintain Personal Information from persons under 18 years-of-age. If we learn that Personal Information of persons under 18-years-of-age has been collected on or through the Services, we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. 

If it comes to our attention through reliable means that a registered user is a child under 18 years of age, we will cancel that user's account and/or access to the Services. 

**Keeping your information private and secure is incredibly important to us. These pages explain what we collect and why we collect it.**

Please note: we only collect what we need and we only share when it’s necessary to help you out. 

**Personal info we collect** |  **Why we collect it?**  
---|---  
Your name, address, and date of birth  |  We need this in order to determine the appropriate insurance price based on a risk assessment of your property, your claims history, credit rating, and other attributes. The credit check has no impact on your credit score.   
Your email address  |  This is part of the account creation process. It’s also the way that we will contact you with policy, service, claims, availability in your region, and news-related communications.   
Your home inventory  |  The more we know about your home and what’s in it, the better and faster we’re able to respond when you have a problem.   
Your payment information  |  This is needed to process your payment. Since we use a third-party payment processor, we have only limited information about your payment transactions.   
Facebook or other social account  |  This may be your preferred method for account creation. You may also use social connection as a way to ease the creation of a Lemonade community or to invite others to Lemonade.   
Contact/Address book  |  You may use your contact list to ease the creation of a Lemonade community or to invite others to Lemonade.   
App and device usage statistics  |  We may collect data from your smartphone. We aggregate and anonymize this data to look for statistical patterns that can help us give you, and all our users, more precise rates and coverage, as well as to improve overall performance and experience.   
The type of incident, date, and time  |  We need this in order to create a record of your claim and to assess how to best respond.   
Your phone number  |  We need this in order to contact you. We may share your phone number with our service providers who need to coordinate with you.   
A short video  |  This helps us better understand what happened. The video is always kept private.   
  
**Credit and Credit Based Information**

**Disclosure in accordance with section 2804(b) of the Insurance Law**

**If you are a first time user please read the following disclosure:**

In connection with this insurance, we may review your credit report or obtain or use a credit-based insurance score, based on information contained in that report. We will not review your credit report or obtain or use a credit-based insurance score in states where this is prohibited. An insurance score uses information from your credit report to help predict how often you are likely to file claims and how expensive those claims will be. Typical items from a credit report that could affect a score include, but are not limited to, the following: payment history, number of revolving accounts, number of new accounts, the presence of collection accounts, bankruptcies and foreclosures. The information used to develop the insurance score comes from TransUnion. 

**If you used our services before and you wish to renew your policy please read the following:**

In connection with this insurance, we may have previously used a credit report or obtained or used a credit-based insurance score based on information contained in that report. We may obtain or use credit information provided again, however, upon renewal of policy, such information may only be used to reduce premiums. We will not review your credit report or obtain or use a credit-based insurance score in states where this is prohibited. An insurance score uses information from your credit report to help predict how often you are likely to file claims and how expensive those claims will be. Typical items from a credit report that could affect a score include, but are not limited to, the following: payment history, number of revolving accounts, number of new accounts, the presence of collection accounts, bankruptcies and foreclosures. The information used to develop the insurance score comes from TransUnion. 

**Location information and other information from devices:**

When you use the services through the App on a device, we will collect and use information about you in generally similar ways and for similar purposes as when you use the Lemonade website. In addition, we may collect information about your location. We may use the location information collected from your device to enhance your use of the Lemonade services by providing you with relevant content and contextual advertising. You can change the privacy settings of your device at any time, in order to turn off the functionality to share location information through the App and/or the website. Please note that turning off location sharing may affect certain features of our services. Though we may identify your geographic location, we do not receive your personal information. We identify your location only to provide a more tailored experience for you. 

**Does Lemonade share my information with others?**

We will not share or sell your information for marketing purposes. We will share certain personal information with our partners and providers in order run our service and to resolve an incident. For example, we may share your name, address, and phone number with a plumber in order to deal with a burst pipe. We may also share non-personally identifiable information in order to improve our modeling and perform aggregate reporting, including by use of Google Analytics and other related services provided by Google (for more information on how Google Analytics collects and processes data visit: [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/)). 

**How do you protect my information?**

We restrict access to your information to our employees and others who we feel must use it to provide our products and services. We also maintain electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information. ****

**If I designate a cause for Giveback, what does that cause learn about me?**

First off, thanks for giving to a cause! You will have an opportunity to share whatever information about yourself that you wish. If you have given permission to a cause to give third parties information about you, such as your name, address or email, then we may be a recipient of that information. 

**What information about me is shared with members of my cause?**

We believe that insurance is all about supporting causes. In some causes, such a local community organization, the internal rules of the organization may permit its members to learn the identity of other members. You can choose to share additional information about your claims and giveback to the other members if you wish to. However, we will never share your personal information or claims information in an identifiable manner with the cause you have selected. That decision is yours to make. 

**How does Lemonade communicate with its policyholders?**

We primarily message our policyholders through email and the Lemonade App. Certain email communication related to your account and claims must be delivered and do not include an unsubscribe option. Please ensure that the email we have on record is accurate. You can manage app notifications through your device settings. 

**Who should use Lemonade’s website and App?**

Our products and services are intended for anyone 18 years of age and old; we do not market any products or services to children under the age of thirteen or knowingly collect any information from children under the age of thirteen. If we become aware that information is or has been submitted by or collected from a child under the age of thirteen, we will delete this information. 

**Will Lemonade ever change this Privacy Policy?**

As Lemonade evolves, we may need to update this policy. No matter what we change, we will always maintain our commitment to protecting your privacy. We will post all revisions, along with their effective dates. We recommend that you check this page every so often to make sure you’re familiar with the latest policy. We will ask for your consent to policy changes if required by applicable law; in other cases, please note that your continued use of the Service after any change means that you agree with, and consent to be bound by, the new Privacy Policy. 

**General, Governing Law and Jurisdiction**

We reserve the right to discontinue or modify any aspect of the Services at any time. This Policy, together with our Terms of Service and any other legal notices published by us on our website and in the App, shall constitute the entire agreement between us concerning the Services. If any provision of this Policy is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Policy, which shall remain in full force and effect, provided, however, that in such event this Policy shall be interpreted so as to give effect, to the greatest extent consistent with, and permitted by, applicable law, to the meaning and intention of the excluded provision as determined by such court of competent jurisdiction. 

This Policy shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. We each agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the State where the policy was issued, and waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.
