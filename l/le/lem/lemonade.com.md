Last updated: May 27, 2019

We, Lemonade, Inc., and our corporate affiliates ("we" or "us"), highly value and respect your privacy. This privacy policy ("Policy") outlines which information we collect when you ("you" or "your") access and use the website, mobile application (the "App"), products and services provided by us (which, together, are referred to as the "Services"), and how we protect and use it. The Policy also wishes to make sure that you are aware of the options available to you when you access and use our Services.

Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the Policy before using our Services. Feel free to email us to [help@lemonade.com](mailto:help@lemonade.com) if you have any questions.

By accessing or using our Services, you agree to this Policy and to our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-service). If you do not agree to this Policy or Terms of Service, please do not access or otherwise use our Services or any information contained herein.

## Protection of Children’s Privacy

IF YOU ARE UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, we do not knowingly collect or maintain Personal Information from persons under 18 years-of-age. If we learn that Personal Information of persons under 18-years-of-age has been collected on or through the Services, we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.

If it comes to our attention through reliable means that a registered user is a child under 18 years of age, we will cancel that user's account and/or access to the Services.

## Collection of Personal Information

 **Keeping your information private and secure is incredibly important to us. These pages explain what we collect and why we collect it.**

Please note: we only collect what we need and we only share when it’s necessary to help you out.

 **Personal info we collect**|  **Why we collect it?**  
---|---  
Your name, address, and date of birth| We need this in order to determine the appropriate insurance price based on a risk assessment of your property, your claims history, credit rating, and other attributes. The credit check has no impact on your credit score.  
Your email address| This is part of the account creation process. It’s also the way that we will contact you with policy, service, claims, availability in your region, and news-related communications.  
Your home inventory| The more we know about your home and what’s in it, the better and faster we’re able to respond when you have a problem.  
Your payment information| This is needed to process your payment. Since we use a third-party payment processor, we have only limited information about your payment transactions.  
Facebook or other social account| This may be your preferred method for account creation. You may also use social connection as a way to ease the creation of a Lemonade community or to invite others to Lemonade.  
Contact/Address book| You may use your contact list to ease the creation of a Lemonade community or to invite others to Lemonade.  
App and device usage statistics| We may collect data from your smartphone. We aggregate and anonymize this data to look for statistical patterns that can help us give you, and all our users, more precise rates and coverage, as well as to improve overall performance and experience.  
The type of incident, date, and time| We need this in order to create a record of your claim and to assess how to best respond.  
Your phone number| We need this in order to contact you. We may share your phone number with our service providers who need to coordinate with you.  
A short video| This helps us better understand what happened. The video is always kept private.

This Policy, together with our Terms of Service and any other legal notices published by us on our website and in the App, shall constitute the entire agreement between us concerning the Services.
