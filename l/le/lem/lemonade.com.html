<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight:
bold;">Effective Date: August 28, 2007<br><br></span>This Privacy
Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to explain: (i) how
Lemonade, Inc. (along with its affiliates from time to time, hereafter,
individually and collectively, “we”, “us” or
“Lemonade”) collects, uses and shares information, (ii) what
type(s) of information we collect; (iii) with whom the information may be
shared; (iv) what choices are available to you regarding our collection,
use, and sharing of the information; (v) how you can access, edit and/or

to protect personal information that is under our control; and (vii)
covers all of our Services.<br><br>This Privacy Policy does not apply

this reference. We hope this will help you make an informed decision about

as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms
defined in said <a href="http://www.lemonade.com/about/legal/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a>

Logging in to the Services<br>•    Submitting Content <br>• 
  Any other business-related reason<br><br>We will allow you to either
agree or decline to give your PII via the Internet. We will inform you of
the purpose for the collection and we do not intend to share or transfer
your PII with/to third parties without your consent, except under the
limited conditions described below. If you choose to provide us with your
PII, we may communicate with you at the contact information you have
provided.  When we use third parties to assist us in processing your PII,
we require that they comply with our Privacy Policy and any other
appropriate confidentiality and security measures.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Processing of PII</span><br><br>Lemonade
processes PII on our or our Third Party Provider’s servers in the
United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process
PII on a server outside your own country. We may process PII to provide our
own Services. In some cases, we may process PII on behalf of and according
to the instructions of a third party, such as our Merchants and
Partners.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Children Under Age
13</span><br><br>Lemonade does not knowingly collect or solicit
personal information from anyone under the age of 13.  In the event that
we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under
age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that
information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any
information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@lemonade.com">info@lemonade.com</a>.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Children
Between the Ages of 13 and 18</span><br><br>We recommend that minors
over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any
information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Domain
Information Collection </span><br><br>Lemonade may collect domain
information to enable us or our Merchants or Partners to analyze how users
use our Services. This data enables us to become more familiar with which
people visit our Services, how often they visit, and what parts of the
Services they visit and/or interact with most often. Lemonade uses this
information to improve its and our Merchants’ and Partners’
Web-based offerings. This information is collected automatically and
requires no action on your part.  Our Merchants and Partners may use your
IP address to determine your approximate geographic location in order to
provide you with location-relevant Links, information and advertising.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Use of
Cookies and Tracking User Traffic</span><br><br>Some pages on the
Services may use “cookies”—small files that the Services
place on your hard drive for identification purposes. A cookie file can
contain information such as a user ID to track the pages visited, but the
only PII a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. These
files are used for Services registration and customization the next time
you visit us.<br>Some parts of the Services may also use cookies to
track user traffic patterns. Lemonade does this in order to determine the
usefulness of our Services information to our users and to see how
effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that
information. Please note that cookies cannot read data off of your hard
drive. Your Web browser may allow you to be notified when you are
receiving a cookie, giving you the choice to accept it or not. If you
prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our Services, you can set
your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie
when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all
cookies by turning them off in your browser, by not accepting cookies,
some pages may not fully function and you may not be able to access
certain information on the Services.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Web Beacons <br><br></span>We also
use Web beacons, sometimes called single-pixel GIFs, that momentarily
direct your browser to a server other than Lemonade’s in a way that
may not be apparent to you. Web beacons are used to count users who
visited specific pages and determine which emails were opened and/or acted
upon when we send HTML-formatted email messages. We do not link any PII to
Web beacons. <br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Third Party Advertisers and Links to Other
Websites<br><br></span>Our Services include third-party advertising,
offers and Links to other websites. We do not provide any personally
identifiable customer information to these third-party websites and
advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf
(collectively, starting with “third party websites”
“Advertisers”), except as specifically set forth herein or any
Additional Terms. <br><br>These Advertisers, sometimes use technology
to send (or “serve”) the advertisements or offers that appear
on our Services directly to your browser. They automatically receive your
IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web
beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other
technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and offers and to
personalize advertising and offer content. We do not have access to or
control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the
information practices of these Advertisers are not covered by this Privacy
Policy. Please contact them directly for more information about their
privacy practices. In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative offers
useful information about Internet advertising companies (also called
“ad networks” or ‘network advertisers”), including
information about how to opt-out of their information collection. <br><br>We also display targeted advertising based on personal information about
users. Although Lemonade does not provide any personal information to
advertisers, advertisers (including ad-serving companies) may assume that
users who interact with or click on a targeted advertisement meet the
targeting criteria used to display the ad (for example, users in the
northwestern United States who like skateboarding).<br><br>“Lemonade Stand Information” that may be collected and
monitored includes, but is not limited to:<br><br>o    Lemonade Stand
content<br>o    Lemonade Stand revenue data<br>o    Lemonade Stand
click through and impression data<br>o    Lemonade Stand launch
date(s)<br>o    Lemonade Stand modification event(s)<br>o    Lemonade
Stand Name(s)<br>o    Lemonade Stand Internet Location<br>o    Any
other information related to a Lemonade Stand<br><br>We may collect,
use, share, transfer or provide Lemonade Stand Information for any
business purpose whatsoever without your consent.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Information
That We Obtain From Third Parties<br><br></span>We will use third
party information, combined with Information you provide to us and
Information collected by our and our Third Party Provider’s,
Merchant’s and Partner’s systems, to better understand the
characteristics of Operators and the visitors to and uses of our Services
and to enhance and/or develop new Services. This information will also
allow us to tailor content, advertising, Products and offers to your
specific interests and needs.<br><br>When we associate information
that we obtain from third parties with PII that we have collected under
this policy, we will treat the acquired information like the information
that we collected ourselves. We will not share information we obtain from
third parties in personally identifiable form, except under the limited
conditions described herein and below. However, we may share aggregated
and other non-PII as described in this Privacy Policy. This may include
information we obtain from third parties in a form that does not permit
you to be identified. We may obtain and use this kind of information from
third parties without receiving further permission from you to do so. <br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight:
bold;">Information Disclosure to Third Parties</span><br><br>We know
how important it is to keep the information you have entrusted to us
confidential. We will not share PII about you with third parties except to
provide you with a product or service you request or under certain
circumstances as described herein. In all other cases, we will ask for
your permission before we disclose your PII.<br><br style="font-weight:
bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Disclosure for Legal
Reasons</span><br><br>When we have a good faith belief that access,
use, preservation or disclosure of PII is reasonably necessary to (a)
satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable
governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service or
Additional Terms, including investigation of potential violations thereof,
(c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical
issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or
safety of Lemonade, its users, Merchants or Partners or the public as
required or permitted by law.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Third Parties<br><br style="font-weight:
bold;"></span>We provide PII to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies
or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing PII
and/or providing the Services on our behalf. We require that these parties
agree to process and/or use such information based on our instructions and
in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate
confidentiality and security measures.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Contests and Sweepstakes<br><br></span>Lemonade may offer or co-sponsor sweepstakes and contests. Any
information submitted by the user for purposes of participation in these
promotions, may be shared publicly and with any affiliates of the
promotion. This information may be necessary for contacting you with
regard to status of the promotion or prizes awarded. All contests and
sweepstakes will specifically inform the participants whether their
information will be shared.   <br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes in Our Corporate Structure <br><br></span>If Lemonade becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any
form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before
PII is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. <br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight:
bold;">Aggregated, Non-PII <br><br></span>We may share aggregated
information about you with third parties. This is Information that is
combined with the non-PII of other users and does not allow you to be
identified or contacted. Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not
charge third parties for this aggregated information. We also may not limit
the third parties’ use of the aggregated information.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Accessing
and Updating PII<br><br></span>When you use our Services, we make good
faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and
either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at
your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for
legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify
themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or
removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process
requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require
disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or
would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning
information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not
otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and
correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so
would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our Services have
different procedures to access, correct or delete users' personal
information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific
FAQs for these services. <br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Community Areas</span><br><br>The Services
feature community areas such as message boards, blogs, chat rooms and
other public forums where people with similar interests can share
information or where Registered Visitors and Operators can post questions
for others to answer (“Public Areas”).  Please remember that
any information that you post in Public Areas is, by design, open to the
public and is not a private, secure service.  You should think carefully
before disclosing any PII in any Public Areas. What you have written and
or posted may be seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties and may
be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict, including
to contact you for unauthorized purposes. As with any public forum on any
Web site, this information may also appear in third-party search engines
like Google, Yahoo, MSN etc.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Co-Branding<br><br></span>Some products or
services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another
company. If you register for or use such products or services, both
Lemonade and the other company may receive the Information collected in
conjunction with the co-branded product or services. Please refer to that
company's privacy policy to determine how that company may use this
Information.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Confidentiality and Security  <br><br></span>Lemonade has implemented commercially reasonable security
measures in order to protect your PII from loss, misuse and unauthorized
access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. It is important for you to
protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer.
Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.  Although we
make good faith efforts to store the Information collected by us in a
secure operating environment that is not available to the public, we
cannot guarantee complete security and we shall not be liable for any
unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors
that may compromise the security of Information.  For any additional
information about the security measures we use on certain Services, please
feel free to email us at the contact information on the Services.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Notice to All Members <br><br></span>If you are unsure whether this privacy policy is in conflict with
the applicable local rules where you are located, you should not submit
your PII to the Services. Anyone who accesses, uses or interacts with the
Services who submits PII does thereby consent to: (i) the international
transfer and/or storage of such information to a country which may be
deemed to have inadequate data protection and (ii) the collection, using
and sharing of such information as provided in this Privacy Policy.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight:
bold;">Changes to this Privacy Policy</span><br><br>This Privacy
Policy is effective August 28, 2007. Lemonade reserves the right to
change, modify or update this Privacy Policy at any time without notice
and for any reason. Any substantial changes in the way we use your PII may
be posted on the Services. Your access, use or interaction with the
Services following the posting of such changes or the updated Privacy
Policy will constitute your acceptance of any such changes. We encourage
you to review our Privacy Policy frequently to make sure that you
understand how we collect, track, compile, use and share information.<br>If you have questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy please email
us at the contact information on the Services.<br></div></div>
