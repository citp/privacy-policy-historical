We offer you the ability to edit your link at any time. While we may, from time to time, send you mail in order to ensure proper listing, or to update your link, we will not distribute any of your information, other than that made available to the public at your request. Access your search engine account via the "[Modify Your Site form](https://web.archive.org/shfiles/docs/editlistings.php)".

    4. **Featured Models, Sites, Cover Models, Contestants, Other Submissions.**    We offer a variety of features based on information through requests from various models, photographers, artists and other industry professionals. Information requested includes your name, a static e-mail address, if applicable, personal statistics, web site url and other information that you give us for the purpose of entering our contest or reviewing your site or otherwise featuring your submitted information.

    5. **Advertisers**
      1. _Banner Exchange Clients_.   We request information from our Banner Exchange Clients, including name and email address, in order to ensure that they may be promptly alerted when a banner is broken, and to ensure the validity of the account.

      2. _Other Advertisers and Sponsors_.   We require information from our advertisers and sponsors, including name, company name, billing address, email address and telephone number, so that we may properly set up and maintain their accounts, to ensure prompt response in the event of a broken link or banner, and to ensure validity of the account.

    6. **Cookies**
      1. _Advertisers_.   We use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we _do not_ have access to this information.
      2. _In-House Advertisements_.   We rent ad space for various locations on our site and use a banner rotation software to rotate the various advertisements. This software will set a cookie to prevent caching of advertisements thereby allowing for the rotation of various advertising creatives.
  2. **What about aggregate or demographic information?**  
In order to provide relevant content of interest to you, our visitor, we may collect demographic information which may be shared with our advertisers or sponsors, or internally.

All data submitted here is contained with a password protected area of the web server and, for the most part, is encrypted and/or is contained within an area not viewable by web browsers except for purposes of editing by the owner of the submitted data.

In addition, an authentication process is in place to ensure only owners of submitted data may access their information, or edit any information contained within.

Further, we utilize tailor-made software whose primany function is detection and blocking of hacking attempts and brute force password guessing software. Users engaging in this type of activity are detected and reported to their respective ISP's and, where applicable, law enforcement agencies.
