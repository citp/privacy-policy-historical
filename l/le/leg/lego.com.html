Where personal information is needed for features to function, we’ll only ask for information that is reasonably required to take part in the activity.</p><p>Here are some examples of times when we collect children’s data:</p><ul><li><h5 id="when-children-register-online">When children register online</h5><p>Children can register on our websites to access a variety of services including content, games and competitions. During registration, we may ask a child to provide their parent’s or guardian’s email address, the child’s first name, gender, their birth date, their username and password. We use this information for security and notification reasons. We strongly encourage children to create a username that excludes any personal information.</p></li><li><h5 id="when-children-share-content-they-ve-created-themselves">When children share content they’ve created themselves</h5><p>Some of our websites allow children to create or use content themselves. Since only some of these features require personal information from the child, not all activities require consent from a parent or guardian. Whenever an activity could potentially allow a child to share personal information, we either review the content ourselves and make sure personal information is removed or ask for permission from a parent or guardian to collect the data. Types of personal data that children have shared with us in the past include stories, free-text fields, drawings that allow text or free-hand entry of information, photographs of your child, sound clips, movie files or any type of content or other persistent identifiers that clearly identifies the child in some way. If, as well as collecting content that includes personal information, we also plan to share the content publicly or with a third party for their own use, we’ll ask the parent or guardian for ‘verifiable parental consent’ (which is a higher level of parental consent).</p></li><li><h5 id="when-children-enter-contests-and-sweepstakes">When children enter contests and sweepstakes</h5><p>If a child wants to enter a competition, we ask for the personal information we need for a child to take part. We usually only ask for the child’s first name (so we can tell the difference between children from the same family) and the email address of a parent or guardian (so we meet legal requirements to notify the responsible adult). We’ll only contact the parent if the child wins the contest or sweepstake to find out where to send the prize. If the competition asks the child to create content to enter, we may need to ask for parental consent by email in advance to ensure we meet the privacy requirements for content children have created themselves (please see the information above about children creating content). Without consent, children won’t be able to take part in our competitions.</p></li><li><h5 id="when-children-receive-emails-from-us">When children receive emails from us</h5><p>We may need ask for their child’s contact details (including their email address) so that we can reply to a question they’ve asked us. To meet legislative requirements around the world, we’ll delete any information we have on the child as soon as the reply’s been sent. If we need to get in touch with the child a second time, for example to reply to additional questions, we would request an email address from their parent or guardian. We’d then only keep the child’s online contact information for the time it takes us to honor their request and wouldn’t use the information for any other purpose. If we ever need a child’s online contact information for ongoing communication, we’d ask for the parent’s or guardian’s email address at the earliest opportunity so that we can keep the adult informed of the data we’re collecting and to give the parent an option to ask us to stop collecting data. Parents or guardians can opt out of any communication we have with their child at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions within each communication (if there is more than one type of communication, the adult may need to opt out of each individually). Alternatively, they can contact our LEGO Customer Service team.</p></li><li><h5 id="when-children-receive-app-push-notifications">When children receive app push notifications</h5><p>Many apps send users ‘push notifications’ to their customers’ mobile phones or devices to tell them about updates (sometimes even when the app is not in use). Some of our apps are designed to be used by children. We ask children to provide the email address of their parent or guardian, so we can tell the adult about their child’s request before we send children push notifications from our apps. We don’t link the device identifier with any other personal information without parental consent. If you would like your child to stop receiving push notifications from one of apps, you can change the settings on the device your child’s using at any time.</p></li><li><h5 id="when-we-collect-location-information">When we collect location information</h5><p>Some of our websites, channels and apps are designed for children. We request consent from a parent or guardian by email before collecting information on a child’s street name, address or coordinates. We do that because such information will effectively make us able to identify a specific child. As an opposite, we don’t require parental consent to collect information on a child’s city, country or region as long as it isn’t linked directly to the specific child. The reason for this, is that such generic information will not make us able to identify a specific child. If you would like to stop us collecting this type of location information, you can adjust the settings on the device your child is using at any time. Alternatively, please contact our LEGO Customer Service team.</p></li><li><h5 id="when-we-collect-persistent-identifiers">When we collect ‘persistent identifiers’</h5><p>So we can give visitors to our online channels more relevant and personalized online experiences, we automatically collect some types on information (e.g. information on IP addresses, mobile device identifier, browsers, internet service providers, referring pages, exit pages, visitor frequency, operating systems, date stamps, time stamps and clickstream data). We collect this information using technologies such as cookies, pixels, flash cookies, web beacons and other unique identifiers (which we define under the Cookie Policy section of this Privacy Policy). We may collect this information ourselves or ask a third party to process the data on our behalf. We use this data to give children access to online features and activities, to customize content, to improve our online channels, to analyze the performance of our online channel and to create anonymous reports. If we ever want to collect children’s data for any other reason, we would contact the child’s parent or guardian for consent in advance. A list of third-party operators who collect ‘persistent identifiers’ on our sites and apps can be found in our Cookie Policy.</p></li></ul><h4 id="what-if-we-accidentally-collect-children-s-data">What if we accidentally collect children’s data?</h4><p>If we discover that we’ve unintentionally collected information from a child in a way that doesn’t meet COPPA requirements, we will delete the information immediately.</p><h4 id="requesting-parental-consent">Requesting parental consent</h4><p>Asking for low-level consent by email<br>If we need to collect a child’s personal information, we’ll ask for parental consent according to COPPA legal requirements. We’ll send the child’s parent or guardian an email explaining what information we’re collecting, how we plan to use it and ask the parent to give or deny their consent. If we don’t receive parental consent in a reasonable time, we’ll delete all information we’ve collected from the child including the adult’s contact information that we asked for in order to request consent.</p><h5 id="asking-for-high-level-verifiable-consent">Asking for high-level ‘verifiable consent</h5><p>If we want to share a child’s personal information publicly or with a third party, we’ll seek a higher level of parental consent than the email request described above. We may ask for verification by credit card or other payment method (with a nominal charge involved), verification over the phone or through a video chat to a trained customer service representative or a signed consent form to be returned to us by mail, email attachment or fax. We may give the parent a guardian a PIN or password that they’ll be able to use in future communications to confirm the adult’s identity.</p><h5 id="what-if-a-parent-or-guardian-hasn-t-been-contacted-for-consent">What if a parent or guardian hasn’t been contacted for consent?</h5><p>If a child under the age of 16 accesses an online channel that’s designed for children by using an age gate, we’ll email the child’s parent or guardian before collecting any personal information from the child. If you think that your child is taking part in an online activity that collects their personal information and you or another parent/guardian hasn’t received an email letting you know or seeking your consent, please contact our Data Privacy Officer at privacy.officer@lego.com. We won’t use email addresses provided for parental consent for any other purpose unless the adult has expressly opted in to marketing emails or taken part in an activity which allows email contact.</p><h5 id="parental-choices-and-controls">Parental choices and controls</h5><p>At any time, parents or guardians can refuse to allow us to use and collect further personal information from their child. Parents or guardians can ask us to delete the personal information we have collected in connection with their child’s account from our records. As personal information is required for some services, deleting a child’s records may result in an account, membership, or service being unavailable to the child in future.</p><p>If a child has a registered LEGO ID, parents or guardians can access, change or delete the personal information we’ve collected from their child by:</p><ul><li>Using their child’s username and password to log into their child’s LEGO ID account<br></li><li>Getting in touch with our <a href="https://www.lego.com/service">LEGO Customer Service team</a><br><br></li></ul><p>If you’d prefer to contact us, please let us know your child’s username along with the your own telephone number and email address. We’ll need to confirm your identity as the parent or guardian of the child before granting access to the child’s personal information. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.</p><p>If we make material changes to how we use Personal Information collected from a child under the age of 16, we’ll tell their parent or guardian by email and ask for ‘verifiable parental consent’ for the new uses of the child’s personal information.</p><h5 id="sharing-information-we-have-consent-to-share-with-others">Sharing information we have consent to share with others</h5><p>If we’ve received high-level parental consent to share a child’s personal information publicly, we may also share personal information with our service provides or legal authorities. We may share information with our service providers including software solution companies, online security partners and customer services. Our contracts with these companies make sure they only use personal data for the agreed purpose.</p><p>We may share personal information to meet legal processes or if disclosure is required by law. As allowed by relevant laws, we may also share personal information collected from children to:</p><ul><li>Comply with a request from to a law enforcement or public agency (including schools or children services) or to avoid liability<br></li><li>Make a disclosure that we believe may stop a crime being committed<br></li><li>Help an investigation related to public safety<br></li><li>Protect the safety of a child who’s using our online channels<br></li><li>Protect the technology of our service providers or security of our online channels themselves<br><br></li></ul><p>Parents have the right to consent to the collection, use and processing of their child’s personal information without also having to consent to the disclosure of that information to third parties. We don’t share information with third parties other than as described above.</p><h4 id="our-employees">Our employees</h4><p>Whether you’re an existing employee or applying for a job with us, we’ll process specific information relevant for your employment and application. The principles in this Privacy Policy will also apply to your employment and application.</p><h4 id="lego-partners">LEGO Partners</h4><p>We define LEGO Partners as other companies doing business with the LEGO Group. We process information on our LEGO Partner companies for collaboration and evaluation purposes.</p><h4 id="data-security-and-integrity">Data security and integrity</h4><p>The security, integrity and confidentiality of customer information is extremely important to us. We use technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use and modification. All external transfers that contain personal information are done using encrypted technology. Credit card information is handled by approved service providers that meet PCI (Payment Card Industry) standards and have appropriate safeguards in place.<br>Although we regularly review our security procedures and evaluate new technology and methods to make our online channels safer, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.</p><p>Our customers, employees and partners also play an important role in protecting information. We encourage customers to choose passwords that are difficult for others to guess and to keep their personal passwords secret.</p><p>Should you notice any flaws or concerns in our security, please contact our LEGO Customer Service team as soon as possible.</p><p>If we ever experience a data breach in which customer information is at risk of being misused, we’ll contact customers according to legal requirements.
