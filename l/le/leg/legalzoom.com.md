| **Our Commitment to Privacy**

LegalZoom is deeply committed to your right to privacy and takes your privacy seriously. We have very strict privacy policies and we strive to keep your personal and financial information secure. 

  * This Privacy Policy covers LegalZoom's treatment of personally identifiable information that LegalZoom collects when you are on the LegalZoom site, and when you use LegalZoom's services. 
  * We pledge to hold all information you provide to us in absolute privacy. 
  * We will NEVER sell or rent your name or personal information to any third party. 
  * We NEVER sell or rent our mailing list. 
  * We are audited by some of the top Internet Privacy companies. 
  * We are active members of several leading online privacy organizations. 
  * Only authorized employees may access your information. 
  * All employees are required to adhere to our strict privacy policies and any employee who violates the privacy policy is subject to termination and other disciplinary measures, up to being criminally prosecuted for their violation.

LegalZoom only collects personally identifiable information you provide in order for you to access and use our customized services. This personal information is necessary to generate the legal documents created by our LegalZip software program. Personally identifiable information includes, but is not limited to, first and last name, physical address, zip code, email address, phone number, social security number, birth date, credit card information, financial information, mortgage information, automobile information, personal wedding information, and other sensitive information necessary to generate proper legal documents. 

If, however, LegalZoom is required by law to comply with a valid legal requirement such as law, federal regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order, LegalZoom may be required to release personal information. We may also use personal information in a manner that does not identify you specifically nor allow you to be contacted but does identify certain criteria about our users in general. For example, we may inform third parties about the number of registered users, number of unique visitors, and the pages most frequently browsed. 

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices, click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp). 

LegalZoom currently retains personally identifiable information for a period of seven years. The reason for this lies in the fact that oftentimes, users will request their legal documents for revision and update purposes. If at anytime you wish to delete all of your personally identifiable information from our site, you may contact us at 

[**customersupport@legalzoom.com**](mailto:customersupport@legalzoom.com) or you may reach us at (323) 962-8600. **Our Commitment To Data Security**

We strive to make certain that our servers and connections incorporate the latest encryption and security devices. To prevent unauthorized access, we have implemented physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. Credit card and personal information are transmitted to us by secure servers. Documents are delivered to you either via priority mail or via e-mail. 

IF FOR ANY REASON YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR PRIVACY HAS BEEN BREACHED THROUGH THE USE OF OUR SITE, YOU MAY CONTACT US IMMEDIATELY AT (323) 962-8600.
