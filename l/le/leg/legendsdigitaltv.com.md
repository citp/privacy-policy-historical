* * *

**Last revised: January 1, 2015**

Legends DTV believes your privacy is important. This Privacy Policy governs each Service, mobile site, application, and/or other service, regardless of how distributed, transmitted, published, or broadcast (each, a "Service”) provided by LegendsDigitalTV.com (“Legends DTV”), its parent, subsidiaries and/or affiliates (“we,” "us," or “our”) that links to this Privacy Policy, which is binding on all those who access, visit and/or use the Service, whether acting as an individual or on behalf of an entity, including you and all persons, entities, or digital engines of any kind that harvest, crawl, index, scrape, spider, or mine digital content by an automated or manual process or otherwise (collectively, “you” or “your”).

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. You can access this Privacy Policy any time in the footer of the Service's home page or initial screen. **Your access, visitation and/or use of the Service, including without limitation any registration on any aspect of the Service, will constitute your agreement to this Privacy Policy.** IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, YOUR PERMISSION TO VISIT, ACCESS AND/OR USE THE SERVICE IS AUTOMATICALLY AND IMMEDIATELY REVOKED AND YOU MUST EXIT AND DISCONTINUE USE OF THE SERVICE IMMEDIATELY.

**1\. Introduction:** This Privacy Policy describes how Legends DTV treats personal information that Legends DTV collects and receives from you through this Service and other online locations such as Facebook and Twitter.

**2\. Agreement to Privacy Policy and Updates:** Legends DTV may revise the Privacy Policy at any time by posting the revised Privacy Policy on the Service. We display the "Last Revised" date under the title of the Privacy Policy so that you will know when there has been a change. You should check the Privacy Policy on a regular basis for the most current Privacy Policy. Each time you access, use or browse the Service, you signify your acceptance of the then-current Privacy Policy applying to your personal information collected by us on and from the effective date of such changes.

Any changes in the Privacy Policy will take effect upon posting and apply only to information collected from you on and after Last Revised date, unless we provide notice or have other communications with you.

Legends DTV may acquire personal information from vendors that may share the information as permitted in their privacy policies, or from other third parties. Legends DTV may combine personal information with information available from other online or offline sources (such as offline records or publicly available information). If the combined information permits us to contact you online or offline, we will treat the combined information as personal information.

In addition to the information you provide and the other methods described above, Legends DTV collects the domain names and IP addresses of its users, along with usage statistics and browsing history.

We also may share your information in response to a subpoena, legal order or official request, when we believe you have acted in violation of the Terms, to investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected illegal activities, fraud or potential threats, or exercise legal rights or defend against claims, when we believe that doing so may protect your safety or the safety of Legends DTV or others, or as otherwise permitted or required by law.

No transmission of data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of Legends DTV to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect personal information, neither Legends DTV nor our service providers can ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us over the internet. Any such transmission is at your own risk.
