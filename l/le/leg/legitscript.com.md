# LegitScript Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") covers LegitScript's treatment of information that you provide to us or that we collect from you when you are visiting and/or use the Website. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that LegitScript does not own or control or to individuals whom LegitScript does not employ or manage, including operators of sites you may link to or from the Website or from which you link to the Website. This Privacy Policy should be read in connection with our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/account-terms).

### 1.0 Agreement.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully; it creates legal obligations. By accessing and/or using our Website, you are acknowledging that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and agree to be legally bound by it.

In addition, if you register as a user of any of the features of our Website (a "Subscriber"), during the registration process (and from time to time as LegitScript may require) you will be prompted to click an "I Agree to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy," "Submit" or similar button, which further confirms your agreement to be legally bound by this Privacy Policy.

### 2.0 Scope of Policy.

This Privacy Policy applies only to information you provide to us online or that we collect from you while visiting or using our Website. It does not apply to information we have obtained offline or through other means.

### 3.0 What Information We Collect and Use.

LegitScript collects (1) personally identifiable information you knowingly provide to us, and (2) general information concerning users gathered at different points on our Website that does not include personally identifiable information:

**3.1. Personally Identifiable Information You Provide to Us:** In order to subscribe to certain LegitScript products and services offered on this Website, we require that you complete a registration form providing certain contact information, such as name, address, email address, telephone number, company name, and other basic contact information.

**3.2. Non-Personally Identifiable Information We Collect:** LegitScript may use "cookies" to collect information about how our Website is used. The types of information collected may include: your IP address; a unique identifier assigned to your workstation; the page from which the cookie was initially installed; the time and date of initial visit; the time and date of subsequent visits; and the cookie expiration date.

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. LegitScript may also use cookies to recognize you when you return to our Website.

### 4.0 What We Do with Information We Collect and Use.

LegitScript uses the information collected via this Website to communicate with you and to provide you with products, services or information that you have requested. If you provide your consent when your personal information is collected via this Website, we may also provide you with additional information, special offers and promotions. We also use information in an aggregate form (so that no individual user is identified) to build up marketing profiles, to aid strategic development, to manage our relationship with advertisers and to audit the usage of the Website.

In general, except as provided in this policy, we will not disclose your personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties without your express consent. There are, however, some limited circumstances in which we may need to disclose personally identifiable information about a user, including, but not limited to, the circumstances set forth below:

**4.1. Imminent Harm:** We may reveal your personally identifiable information to attorneys, private investigators or law enforcement agencies if we believe that you are harming or interfering (or may imminently harm or interfere) with LegitScript, other LegitScript users or anyone else, or violating (either intentionally or unintentionally) our Terms and Conditions of Use or infringing on any of LegitScript's legal rights.

**4.2. Legal:** LegitScript may reveal your personally identifiable information, to the extent we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law.

**4.3.** Transfer of Website: LegitScript shall be entitled to transfer to a third party information it collects, including any personally identifiable information, in connection with a sale of all or substantially all of its assets.

### 5.0 Security of Personally Identifiable Information.

LegitScript has in place security systems reasonably designed to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information you provide to us. Due to the nature of Internet communications and evolving technologies, however, we cannot provide, and disclaim assurance that the information you provide to us will remain free from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain unauthorized access.

### 6.0 Children.

Persons under the age of eighteen (18) are not permitted to register for any LegitScript service and LegitScript does not knowingly collect, either online or offline, personally identifiable information from persons under the age of eighteen (18). If we learn that a child under eighteen (18) has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete this information from our databases, subject to any limitations on our ability to do so, as described in Section 5.0 above.

### 7.0 Modifications to This Privacy Policy.

LegitScript reserves the right to change or modify from time to time, or terminate this Privacy Policy, in its sole discretion. Your use of our Website following any such change constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by this Privacy Policy, as changed.
