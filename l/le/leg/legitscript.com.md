#### Our Legal Basis for Data Processing

In some circumstances, we are not allowed to process personal data if we do not have a valid legal ground. Therefore, we will only process your personal data in these specific situations if:

  * the processing is necessary to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, such as tax reporting or regulatory requirements;
  * the processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of LegitScript, and does not unduly affect your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms (see below);
  * the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest; or
  * if we have your consent.

  * the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim;
  * the data has been manifestly made public;
  * the processing is necessary for to serve a substantial public interest; or
  * you have given your explicit consent to us to process that information (where legally permissible).

#### Accessing and Correcting Data

In some circumstances, you may have the right to access personal data that we hold and ask that we correct, amend, or delete information which is inaccurate or has not been processed in accordance with applicable data protection laws, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or where the privacy rights of third parties would be violated. LegitScript may require EU and Swiss residents to provide sufficient (at LegitScript’s discretion) verification of your identity before responding to your request. We may also ask you to provide information that helps us better understand what you are asking. To exercise your rights, send an email to [privacy@legitscript.com](mailto:privacy@legitscript.com). We’ll do our best to honor these requests as required by applicable laws, but understand that your data access rights are not absolute. They may not always apply to you and exemptions may be appropriate. For example, LegitScript may have limited access to the data we process on behalf of our customers in connection with our services. Therefore, data access requests should include the name of the LegitScript customer who submitted your personal data to LegitScript. We will forward such requests to the customer you identify to respond directly to you and will provide any necessary assistance in that customer’s response to you. LegitScript specifically reserves all rights under this section. If you are not satisfied with how we process your personal data, please let us know and we will investigate your concern.
