# Privacy Policy / Legacy Games

Overview 

At Legacy Games, protecting our user's privacy and security is a top priority. For this reason, we have adopted the following policy to advise you of your choices regarding the use of your personal information online. This policy describes what types of information we gather about you, how we use it, under what circumstances we disclose it to third-parties, and your rights to update or correct it.

Scope of Policy

This policy applies to Legacy Games. It does not apply to other companies' or organizations' web sites to which we link. You should carefully review the privacy policies of those web sites in order to determine how they treat your personal information.

Aggregate Data

We gather certain generic information with respect to customers' use of our web site, such as the number of unique visitors, the frequency with which they visit, and the areas on the web site that they favor. These statistics are very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use this type of data in aggregate-that is, we look at the data on a collective basis, in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. This data helps us determine the extent to which our customers use certain parts of our web site, which, in turn, enables us to make it as appealing as possible. We may also provide statistical "ratings" about how our customers collectively use our web site to advertisers, sponsors, and other companies with which we do business ("Business Partners"). We do this so they, too, can understand how often people use their areas of the site in order for them to provide you with the best possible experience. These statistical ratings do not contain any personally identifiable information about you or any of our users.

Cookies

We use a technology nicknamed "cookies" on our web site. Cookies are pieces of information or data sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to make your visit to our web site easier. Cookies allow us to count the number of unique and return visitors who use our site. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser to notify you when you've received a cookie or, alternatively, to refuse to accept cookies. It is important to note that you may not be able to use certain features on our web site if you choose not to accept cookies, such as favorites. In addition, you will not be able to participate in any of our sweepstakes or contests. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site.

Third Party Advertiser Cookies

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve our ads on the Internet. These third-party advertising companies employ cookie and Clear Gif technology (aka 1x1 Pixel .gifs, Web bugs) to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for their clients. To do so, these companies may use anonymous information about your visits to our Web site and other Web sites. This information can include: date/time of banner ad shown, the banner ad that was shown, their cookie, the IP address. This information can also be used for online preference marketing purposes. Legacy Games does not use or have access to this information.

If you want to prevent a third-party advertiser from setting and/or reading cookies on your computer, currently you may either visit each ad network's web site individually and opt out or visit the web site of the National Advertising Initiative ("NAI") to opt-out of all network-advertising cookies. This site will also allow you to review the third-party advertising companies' privacy policies.

When You Send an Email from our Site

If you use our web site to send an email, we collect your e-mail address and your recipient's e-mail address. This information is necessary to send the content and provide confirmation that it has been received. We will not use your recipient's e-mail address for any purpose other than to send the message. We may use your e-mail address to contact you if you have chosen to receive communications from Legacy Games. (See Opt-Out/Changing Your Status, below).

Personalizing Your Experience on the Website

We examine customer traffic patterns and web site usage to help us enhance the design and layout of the site and make it easier to navigate.

From time to time, we may send you surveys or solicit your feedback. We use surveys to gage user interest in new products and premiums we may offer. We will ask for your feedback on games and site features. We will use the information we gather to improve our site and provide a more meaningful experience for our users. We may also use the information to alert you to offers and products in which you have expressed an interest.

Communications from Legacy Games

We send to all of our users our exclusive Legacy Games Newsletter, which alerts you to new games available on our site. Users can sign up for the newsletter from our home page by providing their e-mail address. This information will not be shared with third parties. Information on how to unsubscribe is included in every newsletter. From time to time, we will also send you invitations to enhance your Legacy Games subscription, offers for new products and services from Legacy Games, special "Members Only" premiums, or special offers from our affiliates and sponsors. These communications are sent to you directly by Legacy Games. We do not share your personally identifiable information with any third parties in connection with the Newsletter.
