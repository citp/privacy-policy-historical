**Our Commitment To Privacy  
**Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

This notice applies to all information collected from or submitted to the following Legal Service India.com Web site(s), but to make this notice easier to read we will refer here only "our Web site", meaning either Legal Service India.com and legalservicesindia.com

Our Web site contains links to other Web sites operated by third parties. Legal Service India.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of such third party Web sites.

This information is used only for internal purposes by our technical support staff.

Our Web site does track certain information about the visits to our Web site. For example, we compile statistics that show the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Web site and its individual pages. These aggregated statistics are used internally to improve our Web site and for product development and marketing purposes generally. Those aggregated statistics may also be provided to advertisers and other third parties, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.

In a few areas on our Web site, we may ask you to provide information that will enable us to verify whether you are entitled to access and use certain information, materials and services available from our Web site, or to enable us to enhance your site visit, to assist you with customer service or technical support issues, or to follow up with you after your visit, or to otherwise support your customer relationship with Legal Service India.com. It is completely optional for you to participate. However, failure to participate may mean that you cannot access and use certain information, materials and services.

For example, we may request information from you when you:  
(a) Log-on to certain areas of our Web site, where you may be prompted to provide us with your user name and password as a condition to gaining access to certain information, materials or services  
(b) Register or sign-up to subscribe to a service Subscribe to a newsletter or desire to be added to our mailing lists for other products or services  
(c) Place an order  
(d) Participate in a sweepstakes or other promotional offer

In each of the instances above, we typically ask for your name, e-mail address, phone number, address, the type of business you are in, product preference information, any applicable identification number or password that we may require, as well as other similar personal information that is needed to register or subscribe you to services or offers. On occasion, we may ask for additional information to enable us to provide you with access to and use of certain information, materials and services. In the case of mailed materials, you will be able to "unsubscribe" to these mailings at any time.
