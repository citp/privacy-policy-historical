### **Cookies**

If you set your browser to refuse our cookies, we honor that.  But our cookies are delicious, just so’in you know’in. Here’s more about our [Cookie Policy in General](https://www.legendsofamerica.com/cookie-policy/) and how you can block them.

**Embedded Content from other websites**

Articles on our site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, a few images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website. For the most part this relates to embedded Youtube videos, however we have also used, in a few occasions, embedded Vimeo videos, and embedded images from Wikimedia Commons.

**Analytics  **

We use Google Analytics and the plugin Google Analytics Dashboard for WP (GADWP). See Google’s Privacy Policy page here (https://policies.google.com/privacy)

### **What Personal data we collect and why we collect it**

If you are simply enjoying our articles, we may collect data as to location and pages visited for our Google Analytics. This plugin allows us to see how many visitors and from where are coming to our pages.  We retain information in analytics for as long as Google will allow us.

We also use [Google Adsense and Google Double Click for Publishers](https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/) for most of our advertising. These services have their own privacy policy and most times information collected through them can be controlled by you/your browser.

We use [GetResponse](https://www.getresponse.com/legal/privacy.html), a reputable, established company, as our Newsletter provider. When you sign up for our newsletter, GetResponse is collecting your name and email address, along with the page you signed up from and your geo location (based on your IP address). The email address is then stored on GetResponse for our use in sending you our monthly newsletter and occasional offers from our supporting websites, Legends’ General Store, and Legends’ Photo Print Shop. You can unsubscribe to our newsletter at anytime using the link provided at the bottom of our newsletters.  Your email address and information is automatically removed from the data base if it is no longer valid, or if you have marked us as spam ( _but why would you do that if you signed up?_ )

[Legends General Store](https://store.legendsofamerica.com/) – Our General Store website (https://store.legendsofamerica.com) has its own [privacy policy](https://store.legendsofamerica.com/index.php?l=page_view&p=privacy_policy), but in a nutshell, we are collecting name, address, phone, email and order history when you place an order. Payment information is sent direct to our credit card processor or PayPal and is NOT stored on our servers.  Cookies may be used to help you stay logged in or save items in your cart.  But you can always delete those if you want to.

[Legends Photo Print Shop](http://photos.legendsofamerica.com/) – Our Photo Print Shop website (http://photos.legendsofamerica.com) is hosted by Zenfolio.com which specializes in showcasing and sales of Photo Prints and other Products. [Zenfolio.com has its own privacy policy](https://zenfolio.com/privacy). As of this policy update (May 19, 2018) only areas that collect your personal information for ordering are on an SSL (https) url.  This will change in July 2018 when the entire website will install an SSL certificate.

### **Comments**

When visitors leave comments on our website we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

Visitor comments are checked through an automated spam detection service. As of this update, that is the company Akismet.

_**Akismet:**_

We collect information about visitors who comment on Sites that use our Akismet anti-spam service. The information we collect depends on how the User sets up Akismet for the Site, but typically includes the commenter’s IP address, user agent, referrer, and Site URL (along with other information directly provided by the commenter such as their name, username, email address, and the comment itself).

### **Who we share your data with**

Google (analytics and advertising modules), GetResponse (newsletter sign up), Akismet, Wordfence (security), Quantum Gateway (our credit card processor on our General Store) and Zenfolio (our Photo Print Provider).  Of course, data shared from our General Store and Photo Print shop depends on whether or not you order…and you want to order don’t you?  🙂

### **How long we retain data**

We’ve asked Google to retain data about our visitors as long as allowed to give us a clear picture of our website’s performance. Comments are also retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.  When you sign up for our newsletter, your information is stored on GetResponse until you unsubscribe.  If you mark us as spam, your email address may never be used again to sign up for our newsletter, but why would you want to do that? When you accept our cookie notification, we will not ask you again, from the device you are on, for 3 months. That time would be shortened obviously if you delete cookies on your device, because that’s how we are keeping track (Cookie Notice).

### **What Rights you have over your data**

If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

### **How we protect your data**

In addition to our SSL security certificate, we use Wordfence, a reputable website security system and strong administrative password protection to help prevent hacking. We do NOT sell or rent any data from our visitors.

### **More?  **

We’re pretty open about our website. If you have any concerns/questions regarding this privacy policy, give Dave a call for a chit chat. 660-723-2550, or email orders @ legendsofamerica.com
