Further information regarding the lawful basis for processing personal data can be found at [ico.org.uk](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/)

**Lead Forensics Marketing and Sales Data**

As an organisation that processes business related data, Lead Forensics has assessed all six grounds for lawful processing of personal data and has selected ‘Legitimate Interests’ as the most suitable lawful ground for the processing of data for the purposes of Lead Forensics marketing and sales

Lead Forensics collects, processes and stores data relating to businesses and decision makers.  We believe that the individuals that we process the data of, are likely to have an interest in the Lead Forensics product.  Deemed as ‘Legitimate Interest’ this is based upon specific criteria including the business industry sector, size of organisation as well as the individual’s job function within the organisation.  Our typical segmentation includes those within marketing, sales, business development, MD and owner related job functions, although this list is not exhaustive and other variables may apply.

We will only ever collect, process and store the essential information required for making contact with the data subjects within a business environment.  The personal data we collect is limited to first name, last name, email address, social profiles (limited to LinkedIN) as well as business IP address.  Other business related data may also be processed including business name, job function, turnover and business address, however we will never collect further personal data such as those classed under ‘Sensitive Personal Data’.

The data collected will be used to communicate marketing and sales messages relating to the Lead Forensics product, based upon the job function held by the data subject.  Lead Forensics specifically only sends messages to those we believe are likely to be interested in the Lead Forensics product based upon the organisation they are employed by and based upon their job function within that organisation.  Messages from Lead Forensics could be delivered via email, social media, via telephone or any other business to business (B2B) marketing methods that may be relevant.

When you send Lead Forensics an enquiry or booking form via our website or one of our micro sites you will be asked to provide your contact details. We will use the data you provide to process your request and may use it to inform you by email, telephone or mail about other Lead Forensics products and services that we feel may be of interest to you, it is deemed that as you have visited the Lead Forensics website and provided us with your contact information that you are legitimately interested in our products and services.  You have the right to object from any method of correspondence at any time, by following the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the email,  by informing the telephone operator or by contacting us via any of the methods below.

**How we Procure Data**

**Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA)**

Lead Forensics has carried out a Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA) as advised by the ICO.  Based upon that assessment it is deemed that the rights and freedoms of the data subjects would not be overridden in our correspondence regarding Lead Forensics and that in no way would a data subject be caused harm by our correspondence. Based upon our segmentation by organisation and by specific job function, coupled with our processing of personal data within the context of a business environment, we believe that any individual that receives correspondence from Lead Forensics in a direct marketing or sales capacity, could be legitimately interested in the Lead Forensics solution.  It is also deemed that direct marketing and sales is necessary in the context of promoting Lead Forensics to professionals in business in order to increase awareness of our SaaS solution in the marketplace.

Per the ICO guidance, Lead Forensics can confirm:

  * We have checked that legitimate interests is the most appropriate basis
  * We understand our responsibility to protect the individual’s interests
  * We have conducted a legitimate interests assessment (LIA) and kept a record of it, to ensure that we can justify our decision
  * We have identified the relevant legitimate interests
  * We have checked that the processing is necessary and there is no less intrusive way to achieve the same result
  * We have done a balancing test, and are confident that the individual’s interests do not override those legitimate interests
  * We only use individuals’ data in ways they would reasonably expect
  * We are not using people’s data in ways they would find intrusive or which could cause them harm
  * We do not process the data of children
  * We have considered safeguards to reduce the impact where possible
  * We will always ensure there is an opt-out / ability to object
  * Our LIA did not identify a significant privacy impact, and therefore we do not require a DPIA
  * We keep our LIA under review every six months, and will repeat it if circumstances change
  * We include information about our legitimate interests in our privacy notice

**Request for Deletion**
