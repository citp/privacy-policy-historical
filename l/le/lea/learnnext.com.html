                        <li>Log-on to certain areas of the Web site <a href="http://www.learnnext.com">LearnNext</a> where you may be prompted to provide us with your Log in Name and Password as a condition to gaining access to certain information, materials or services.</li>

	            <p>Wherever <a href="http://www.learnnext.com">LearnNext</a> collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.</p>

The personal information you provide to us when using the Web site, such as your name, postal, e-mail address or telephone number will be kept confidential and used to support your relationship with <a href="http://www.learnnext.com">LearnNext</a> to notify you of special offers, updated information and new products and services from <a href="http://www.learnnext.com">LearnNext</a>, or offers from third parties that we think may be of interest to you.
