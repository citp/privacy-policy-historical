		Information We Collect from You </span></b>
		<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:#333333"><br>
		Learning.com strives to provide information and services that are well 
		tailored to your needs. To do this, we may ask you to register or to 
		provide certain personal information in order to use the services 
		including visiting various areas of our website, entering a contest or 
		sweepstakes, completing surveys, submitting content, subscribing to a 
		newsletter or asking us for additional information. We only collect 
		personally identifiable information that you submit voluntarily. If you 
		choose not to register or provide personal information as we request, 
		you may still enjoy our website. However, you won't have access to those 
		Services that require such information, like the EasyTech Instructional 
		System. </span></p>
		<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333">2. 
		Why We Collect Information </span></b>
		<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:#333333"><br>
		Learning.com collects personal information for such purposes as sending 
		updates concerning promotions and changes to our Services, tracking and 
		verifying compliance with our policies and with various laws and 
		regulations, and for editorial, feedback and other related purposes. In 
		addition, Learning.com may occasionally present a special contest or 
		promotion sponsored by another company. To qualify for entry, we may ask 
		you to provide personal information. If we plan to share that 
		information with the sponsor, we will inform you of that when we request 
		your information. </span></p>
		<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333">In 
		exceptional cases when we have reason to believe that doing so is 
		necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who 
		may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or 
		unintentionally) Learning.com's rights or property, our Users, or anyone 
		else who could be harmed by such activities, we may disclose User 
		information when we believe in good faith that the law requires us to do 
		so. </span></p>
		<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333">In 
		addition, in the event of an assignment, sale, joint venture or other 
		transfer or disposition of some or all of the assets of the company, The 
		Learning Internet, or its sites, including Learning.com, you agree that 
		we can accordingly assign, sell, license or transfer any information 
		that our Users have provided to us, including personally identifying 
		information, to the third party(s) purchasing or assuming such assets.
		</span></p>
		<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333">3. 
		Opting Out </span></b>
		<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333"><br>
		Learning.com provides users the opportunity to "opt out" or "opt in" for 
		receiving communications concerning Learning.com, updates to its 
		services, and promotional materials whenever registration is required. 
		The term "opt out" refers to the user's ability to provide an electronic 
		notification declining further specified kinds of contact, including but 
		not limited to promotional and general informational email. This is done 
		by selecting an option on a website screen or in a website dialog box, 
		with such selection made by the user at the user's sole discretion. The 
		term "opt in" refers to a user's ability to provide an electronic 
		notification inviting further specified kinds of contact, including but 
		not limited to email. This is also done by selecting an option on a 
		website screen or in a website dialog box, with such selection made by 
		the user. At any point in the future, a User may "opt out" or "opt in" 
		regarding communications from Learning.com by updating the User's 
		information on Learning.com's "My Settings" link. The "opt in" and "opt 
		out" features will not, however, affect email specifically directed to a 
		User for purposes of discussing membership activity, in response to User 
		inquiries, or to enforce this Privacy Policy. </span></p>
		<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333">5. 
		Use of Aggregate User Information </span></b>
		<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial;color:#333333"><br>
		Learning.com may share aggregate information about our Users with 
		advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. For 
		example, we may say that our audience is "x" percent male and "y" 
		percent female. We use this information to customize our content and 
		advertising to deliver services that are well tailored to our Users' 
		needs. </span></p>
		<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333">6. 
		Use of Cookies </span></b>
		<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333"><br>
		The use of "cookies" is standard in the Internet industry. They are used 
		on most commercial and other websites. Cookies are small text files 
		written to your computer. They make our Website easier for you to use 
		because they save your preferences while you're at our sites (although 
		we do not save passwords in cookies). Cookies also help us know which 
		areas are your favorites, which may need improvement and what 
		technologies and Internet services our Users like. Knowing this 
		information helps us improve the services for our Users. The information 
		we track with cookies is anonymous and is not used to identify, or lead 
		us back to, any particular User. Users may have the option of disabling 
		cookies via their browser preferences (most browsers are initially set 
		up to accept cookies). However, some features of our Website will not 
		function properly or may function more slowly if you refuse cookies. 
		While using our Website, you may get cookies from our advertisers or 
		sponsors. Learning.com does not control such cookies. However, such use 
		of cookies is very common in the Internet industry. </span></p>
		<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333">7. 
		Use of IP Addresses </span></b>
		<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:#333333"><br>
		An IP address is a number that has been automatically assigned to your 
		computer. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP 
		address. Learning.com may collect IP addresses for the purposes of 
		system administration, to report aggregate information to our 
		advertisers, sponsors, and partners, and to audit the use of our site. 
		When Users request Web pages from our services, our servers log the 
		Users' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything 
		personally identifiable. This means that a User's session will be 
		logged, but the User remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP 
		addresses to identify a User when we feel it is necessary to enforce 
		compliance with our rules or terms of service or to protect our service, 
		site, customers or others. </span></p>
		<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333">Some 
		features of our services, such as certain message boards, may display IP 
		addresses along with the message- poster's User name and message. Please 
		review each feature prior to use and only use those that disclose 
		information you are comfortable sharing. </span></p>
		<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333">8. 
		Links to Other Sites </span></b>
		<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:#333333"><br>
		Learning.com's services may include or bring you into contact with links 
		to third party owned, controlled, or managed websites. Additionally, you 
		may see links from advertisers, sponsors and other partners who may use 
		Learning.com's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. Learning.com 
		does not control content, or any aspect, of these third party websites. 
		For example, if you click on a search result or banner advertisement, 
		that click takes you off our sites. Third party websites may send you 
		their own cookies, collect data or solicit personal information. While 
		we identify sponsor and advertiser areas of our Website, we do not 
		control the practices or the content of these third party sites. Once 
		you leave our servers (you can usually see where you are by checking the 
		URL in the location bar on your browser), the use of any information you 
		provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site 
		you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find 
		the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from that site's 
		homepage, you should contact the site directly for more information and 
		proceed entirely at your own risk. We specifically recommend that 
		children check with their parents, guardians or teachers before clicking 
		onto any third party sites. </span></p>
		<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333">9. 
		Security of Information</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial;color:#333333"> <br>
		The security of our Users' personally identifiable information is of the 
		highest priority. Learning.com exercises great care in providing secure 
		transmission of your information from your PC to our servers. 
		Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 
		to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal 
		information, Learning.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any 
		information you transmit to us or through our services, and you do so at 
		your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best 
		effort to ensure its security on our systems. Whenever credit card 
		information is transmitted we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket 
		layer) encryption. If you have an account or use another 
		password-protected service, you are the only person who can access it 
		and view the User information concerning the account. We strongly 
		recommend that you do not share your password with anyone. Learning.com 
		will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or 
		email. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of 
		your passwords and any account information. Please remember to sign out 
		properly and close your browser window when you have finished your work. 
		This helps ensure that others cannot access your personal information 
		and in the event the computer you use is accessible to others or if you 
		share a computer with someone else or use a computer in a public place 
		such as a library or Internet cafe. </span></p>
		<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333333">In 
		addition, from time to time Learning.com may create and supply, at its 
		sole discretion, additional security features for its Users. These 
		security features are designed only for the use of Users. Learning.com 
		provides no warranty, express or implied, that any such security 
		features may not be broken, violated or in some way compromised. </span>

		can instruct us to delete a child's information at any time and can also

		by sending us a written request addressed to Consumer Relations, Attn: 
		Children's Online Privacy Act - Delete Request, 1440 NW Overton Street,
