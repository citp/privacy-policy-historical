## What we collect and store

### Product Purchases

When purchasing a product from us we will ask Users to provide information including their name, billing address, email address, credit card/payment details and account username. This information will be used to:

When making a purchase we will store a User’s name, and billing address, which will be used to populate the checkout for future orders.

We generally store information about users for as long as we need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it, and we are not legally required to continue to keep it.
