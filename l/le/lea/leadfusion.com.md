Cookies  
Leadfusion's website and Products may use "cookies" which are placed on visitor's personal computers. For example, cookies used in Products enable data persistence so that visitors do not have to re-enter their information when utilizing more then one Product or when returning to use Product at a later time.  
  
**Use of Information**  
Information collected by Leadfusion on the website will be used to contact the visitor in direct response to their inquiry or for marketing purposes.

**Sharing of Information**  
_Legal Disclaimer_  
Though we make every effort to preserve visitor privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website.

_Third Parties_  
We DO NOT Share Personal Information with third parties (i) unless such parties are providing a service for Leadfusion; (ii) in the event of a business transition as set forth below; or (iii) if required to do so by law.

_Business Transitions_  
In the event that Leadfusion goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, a sale of all or a portion of its assets, visitors' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.  
  
**Choice to Opt-out**  
Customers who no longer wish to receive communications about future Leadfusion products and services may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to the email with "unsubscribe" in the subject line, or by emailing us at [privacy@leadfusion.com](mailto:privacy@leadfusion.com).

**Security of Information**  
At Leadfusion we take precautions in accordance with industry standards to protect our visitors' information. When a visitor submits information via our website, their information is protected both online and off-line.

When our clients are logged into the administrative area managing their licensed products, their activities are protected by a 128-bit SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption technology. While we use SSL encryption to protect information online, we also protect visitor and client information off-line in accordance with industry standards. Nevertheless, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and while Leadfusion strives to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant that it will remain secure. You agree that Leadfusion shall not be held responsible for harm that you or any person may suffer as a result of a breach of confidentiality in respect to your use of the Leadfusion's website or Products or any information that is collected or that you transmit to us.

**Notification of Changes**  
Leadfusion reserves the right to change this privacy policy without notice. If, however, we are going to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify visitors and clients via email. Visitors and clients will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if a visitor or client has opted out of all communication with Leadfusion, they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this different manner.
