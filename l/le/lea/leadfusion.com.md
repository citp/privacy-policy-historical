###  Security of Information

At Leadfusion we take precautions in accordance with industry standards to protect our visitors' information. When a visitor submits information via our website, their information is protected both online and off-line.

When our clients are logged into the administrative area managing their licensed products, their activities are protected by a 128-bit SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption technology.
