## Privacy Policy

Merriam-Webster is committed to respecting the privacy of visitors to its Web sites. The guidelines below explain some of the steps we have taken to protect the privacy of visitors to Merriam-Webster's LearnersDictionary.com and its features.

**Privacy and Personal Information**  
Merriam-Webster protects the identity of visitors to Merriam-Webster's LearnersDictionary.com by limiting the collection of personal information. For certain promotions and to access certain features, such as to receive a Word of the Day subscription, we may request a voluntary submission of information such as name, e-mail address, city, state, and age.

Merriam-Webster does not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifying information from or about children under 13, except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe Merriam-Webster has any information from or about anyone under 13, please e-mail us at the Comments and Suggestions address listed on our [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/contact.htm) page.

All personally identifying information collected through Merriam-Webster's LearnersDictionary.com is used by Merriam-Webster and its staff to process and manage subscriptions, track site usage patterns and statistics, or to deliver services through the site; such information may also be used by the company for market research or for prize or information-request fulfillment unless otherwise indicated. Such information will not be posted or published by us, and, except as specified below in this privacy policy regarding anonymous aggregated data, or to provide services to you on behalf of Merriam-Webster's LearnersDictionary.com, it will not be provided to third-party providers without consent.

If you choose to provide personally identifying information to us, you may receive the following types of e-mails from us: 

  * E-mails related to subscription-maintenance activities. 
  * Periodic e-mail newsletters highlighting new features, content, and usage tips for Merriam-Webster's LearnersDictionary.com. 
  * Periodic special offers for additional Merriam-Webster and Encyclopædia Britannica (Merriam-Webster's parent company) products and services. 
  * Periodic special offers from Merriam-Webster approved partners if you "opt-in" or give us your permission to send them.



When you provide personally identifying information to us, you can let us know that you do not wish to receive special Merriam-Webster or partner offers. Each offer will also have information available to allow you to "opt out" if you wish to receive no further offers.

Anonymous aggregated data may be provided to other companies we do business with for statistical or market research purposes. For example, we may report to advertisers that a certain percentage of our site's users are adults between the ages of 25 and 35.

This site, Merriam-Webster's LearnersDictionary.com, may use the services of an advertising agency for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions and other marketing messages. To do this, the agency may collect anonymous data through the use of cookies or by other means.

Merriam-Webster's LearnersDictionary.com may also use other third-party providers to facilitate the delivery of the services described above, and these third-party providers may be supplied with or have access to personally identifying information for the sole purpose of providing these services to you on behalf of Merriam-Webster's LearnersDictionary.com.

Merriam-Webster may also disclose personally identifying information in special legal circumstances. For instance, such information may be used where it is necessary to protect our copyright or intellectual property rights, or if the law requires us to do so.
