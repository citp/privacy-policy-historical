# LeasePlan Corporation N.V. | Global Privacy Statement

Updated 1 November 2015

## LeasePlan Services

### Our services

LeasePlan is a car leasing company and therefore most of the data we process are in relation to the vehicle management services we provide to you as the driver and to your employer if you have a company car. This starts with the registration of your leased vehicle, and continues when we communicate with you about our services, e.g. to arrange for periodic maintenance and repairs. We may also process your data when your vehicle inadvertently is involved in an accident, to ensure that we restore mobility and handle any damage, or where we are the recipient of traffic fines in relation to your leased vehicle. Next to our core-leasing activities, we also provide a number of other related services, such as fuel card services, car rental services, and roadside assistance. Note that we continuously try to improve our services and your user experience, by implementing innovations, such as telematics services which enable drivers to benchmark their fuel use consumption and driver behavior.

In order to provide you with our services, we often work closely with Service Partners and Service Providers. Our **Service Partners** assist us in providing our leasing and other services to you, and include car dealerships, car maintenance providers, body repair shops, and roadside assistance providers, but also rental service companies, and the administrators of our driver safety programs. **Service Providers** are companies we retain that support us in running our business, for example to help us maintain our IT network and related infrastructure, and security and access controls to our premises.

### How do we receive and process your information?

There are a variety of ways in which we come into the possession of your personal information, such as when you start using your leased vehicles (either through your employer or through private lease), when you visit our website,or otherwise interact with us. Data may come from you directly, e.g. when you contact us in relation to roadside assistance or to report an accident involving your leased vehicle or when you respond to our surveys. When you have received your leased vehicle in the context of your employment, we may also receive information from your employer, such as your basic contact information and your lease category. When you have engaged with one of our Service Partners, we may receive information back from them such as when your vehicle has been repaired, when you have participated in a driver safety program or when you have rented a car through our program.

### LeasePlan Privacy Pledges

Regardless of when and how we process your personal information:

  * #### Transparency:

  * #### Data transfers:

We ensure that your personal information is treated with a high level of protection throughout the LeasePlan group.
