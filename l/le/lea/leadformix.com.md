LeadFormix is committed to protecting the privacy of your information. This Privacy Statement describes LeadFormix’s privacy practices.

#### 1\. Information Collected

LeadFormix offers a variety of applications and services that are collectively referred to as the “Services”.

When expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about the Services or registering to use the Services, LeadFormix requires you to provide LeadFormix with contact information, such as name, company name, address, phone number, and email address (“Required Contact Information”). When purchasing the Services, LeadFormix may require you to provide LeadFormix with billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of employees within the organization that will be using the Services (“Billing Information”). LeadFormix may also ask you to provide additional information, such as company annual revenues, number of employees, or industry (“Optional Information”). Required Contact Information, Billing Information, and Optional Information are referred to collectively as “Data About LeadFormix Customers.”

As you navigate LeadFormix’s web site or a web site of LeadFormix’s Customers, LeadFormix may collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies (“Web Site Navigational Information”).
