# Our Privacy Policy - SitePoint

This privacy policy sets out how SitePoint Pty Ltd (ACN 089 647 638) (“we/SitePoint”) treats the privacy of customers and others with whom we interact. 

In this privacy policy, the term “personal information” includes information about an identifiable individual, including names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, “bio” information, credit and banking details and if and where applicable, includes information that constitutes “sensitive information”. 

**1\. Collection and Storage of Personal Information and Data**

We may collect personal information about individuals. Our usual approach is to collect personal information directly from the individual concerned. This information could include name, email, telephone or address contact details and financial details. In most circumstances we do not collect sensitive information. 

For example, we collect personal information in circumstances including: 

(i) upon your registration on our website; 

(ii) when products or services are ordered; 

(iii) when paying for products or services and when processing returns or exchanges; 

(iv) when you telephone us or visit our website and make an enquiry to which a later response is requested and to do so requires your contact details; 

(v) when you ask to be included on marketing distribution lists or interact with us through our social media services or third party social media services that are connected to our site; and
