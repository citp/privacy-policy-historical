# Annenberg Learner: Privacy Policy

| 

Privacy Policy 

**Your Privacy**  
Annenberg Learner wishes to protect your privacy on the Web and in all areas where we connect with you. This privacy statement is divided into two parts: first, our general principles, and, second, the detailed actions we take to behave according to those principles. You can think of this second section as the "small print" or "legalese" section. Please feel free to send any questions you may have about this privacy policy to us at info@learner.org.

**Our Principles**

**1\. Your privacy will be protected.**

> Annenberg Learner shares some information we receive about you with trusted third parties. All such third parties are bound by confidentiality agreements. This information includes both traditional factual information (your name, address, phone number, etc.) and electronic, technical, Web-oriented information (your IP address, email configuration, email address, etc.) Neither we, nor these third parties, will use this information for any reason except to analyze aggregate usage patterns for the site; and to provide and maintain services you have requested through learner.org.

**2\. We do not share mailing lists.**

> Annenberg Learner does not sell or exchange mailing lists. 

**3\. You will not be spammed.**

> You will only receive email outreach messages from us if you register as a workshop leader, make an inquiry about our work, or request to be placed on a list receiving weekly or monthly updates and news from us through email. 

**4\. We will address your privacy concerns promptly.**

> If you receive our weekly or monthly email news in error, or if you ever wish to discontinue them, or if any other concern related to online interactivity or online ordering arises, please let us know immediately-and we will do our best to solve the problem immediately. 

**Our Actions**

The electronic information our servers collect about visitors depends on what the visitors do while visiting our Web site. 

**1\. If you visit our site to browse, read, download information, or make an order:**

> We collect the IP ("internet protocol") addresses of our site visitors, in order to measure the number and frequency of visitors. This is often referred to as collecting information about "traffic." 
> 
> We use cookies on our site to facilitate the purchase of products, viewing of videos, interaction with various Web site forms, and the general user experience on our Web site. If you do not wish to accept cookies from our Web site, you can set your Web browser to block the cookies, but this may impact your use of the Web site. 

**2\. If you identify yourself personally to us by sending us an email or using an online form to order materials, to register as a workshop site leader, or to subscribe to any of our weekly or monthly email news updates:**

> We store the information you voluntarily provide, and use it to contact you for matters related to the purpose for which you gave it to us. We do not share this information with other organizations or use it for commercial purposes other than those you directly request. If you sign up as a workshop site leader, we may give your work address and email to individual workshop participants who wish to join your site or share your resources. 
> 
> In other limited and exceptional circumstances, we may be required by law to disclose the information you submit. An investigation of credit card fraud would be an example of such circumstances.
> 
> If you use one of our online forms, the information you provide is entirely at your discretion. In the event of a complaint or request from you in the future, it may be impossible for us to refer to, respond to, or investigate your complaint unless you have already shared some information with us through one of our online forms. In other words, if you visit our site anonymously, and leave no footprints behind, we won't be able to help you by retracing any of your steps.
> 
> Learner.org uses Google Analytics, a Web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (�Google�). Google Analytics uses �cookies,� which are text files placed on your computer, to help learner.org analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the learner.org (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States . Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the learner.org, compiling reports on learner.org activity for Web site operators and providing other services relating to learner.org activity and Internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser; however, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of learner.org. By using this learner.org, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.

**3\. If you want to retrieve or correct your personal information that may be in our records:**

> We comply happily with the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act of 1974 to provide you certain rights to view your personal information maintained in our records. Upon request we will provide you with access to your contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number), and offer you the chance to correct inaccuracies.

**4\. If you would like to opt out of our mailings and services:**

> If you do not want to receive email or postal mail from us in the future, please let us know and we will comply. Give us the exact email or postal mail address you would like removed from our lists, and we will do it. 

**5\. A further note about security:**

> If you send us an email message or use one of our online forms, you should be aware that your information is not necessarily secure against electronic interception by unknown and unforeseeable third parties, commonly known as "hackers." If you believe your communication to us includes sensitive information, please contact us by postal mail or telephone rather than by email. 
> 
> Once your information has been collected in our database, we have appropriate security measures in place at our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you.

**6\. In the event of changes to this policy:**

> We reserve the right to use site visitor information in the future for new, unanticipated uses not disclosed in this privacy notice. This is not because we foresee any change in our principles, but because ongoing advances in electronic interactivity may change the very ways you and we connect. Such changes are impossible to foresee. In any case, if our electronic information practices change in these ways, we will post such policy changes on our Web site. You will then have, as you do now, the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, check back at our Web site periodically.
