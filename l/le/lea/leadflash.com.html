            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy ("Policy") applies to the LeadFlash.com web site. It tells
                users ("you" or "applicant") of the web site and the services provided therein about
                the information collected by LeadFlash.com and how LeadFlash.com uses
                and shares this information. <br>The LeadFlash.com web site is operated by LeadFlash, LLC.
            </p>
            <h3>Types of Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>
                LeadFlash.com collects both "personally identifiable information" and "non-personally
                identifiable information" from or about users of its web sites.</p>
            <p>
                <strong><em>Personally Identifiable Information</em></strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                LeadFlash.com collects several types of information that may identify a particular
                individual ("personally identifiable information"). We collect personally identifiable
                information when you provide it to us through your use of the site, such as by completing
                one or more stages of an application form to apply for an auto loan from a lender
                in our auto loan network ("participating lenders") or by sending questions to us
                via the web site. The types of personally identifiable information we collect include:
                name, physical address, telephone number, social security number, e-mail address,
                date of birth, information about home ownership, employment information and the
                amount of your pay checks.</p>
            <p>
                <strong><em>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</em></strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Non-personally identifiable information is anonymous information that cannot be
                associated with a specific individual. The types of non-personally identifiable
                information that we collect (either directly, through the use of "cookies," or through
                the use of a third party tracking system) include: the IP address of the computer
                making the request; your browser type and language; access times; information about
                areas of the site visited by users of the site; information about the links that
                users may select to visit on the site. IP addresses are not usually associated with
                your personal computer, but with a portal through which you accessed the Internet.
                IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. A "cookie" is
                a piece of information a web site sends to your computer while you are viewing the
                web site to remember who you are without personally identifying you.
            </p>
            <p>
                LeadFlash.com may share this non-personally identifiable information only
                in summary form with its suppliers and other third parties for the purpose of web
                site statistical and trend analysis. This information is not linked to any personally
                identifiable information that can identify an individual person.</p>
            <h3>Information Collected by Third Parties</h3>
            <p>
                We may allow third parties, including advertising partners and auto loan lenders,
                to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use tracking technologies,
                including cookies, to collect information about users of our site who view or interact
                with these advertisements. LeadFlash.com does not provide personally identifiable
                information to these third parties.</p>
            <h3>How We Use Personally-Identifiable Information</h3>
            <p>
                We use the personally-identifiable information you provide to us through this site
                in order to deliver the products or services you have requested; provide you with
                customer support; verify or review your application information to determine whether
                it meets eligibility requirements for participating lenders; communicate with you
                by email, postal mail, telephone, and/or mobile devices about products or services
                that may be of interest to you either from us, our marketing partners, or other
                third parties; display advertising tailored to your interests or background; perform
                data and statistical analysis on use of the web site; enforce our terms and conditions,
                and perform any other functions otherwise described to you at the time we collect
                the information.</p>
            <p>
                We may review and use your financial information and your social security number
                to match you with participating lenders in our auto loan network or other third

                financial information and social security number to verify your identify and protect
                against possible fraudulent transaction.</p>
            <h3>
                Sharing Your Personally-Identifiable Information</h3>
            <p>
                LeadFlash.com may share your personally-identifiable information (including,
                without limitation, your financial account information and social security number)
                with lenders participating in our auto loan network and other third party lenders
                with whom we have a business relationship. These third party lenders may use your
                personally-identifiable information to offer you an auto loan or to communicate
                with you about other business or marketing offers. In addition, we may share your
                personally identifiable information (not including your financial account information
                and social security number) with unaffiliated third party marketers and list managers
                with whom we have a business relationship.</p>
            <p>
                Any third parties with whom we share personally-identifiable information may have
                their own policies which describe how they use and disclose your information. Those
                policies will govern the use, handling, and disclosure of your information once
                we have transferred or shared it with those third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
                LeadFlash.com will disclose your personally-identifiable information in response
                to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation
                from a law enforcement agency or other government agency; to establish or exercise
                our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law.
                We will disclose your personally-identifiable information when we believe disclosure
                is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activity,
                suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property,
                or safety of our company, our employees, our web site users, or others; or to enforce
                our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.</p>
            <p>
                In addition, in the event that all or substantially all of LeadFlash.com's
                stock and/or assets are transferred or sold to another entity, LeadFlash.com
                may transfer personally-identifiable information to the acquiring entity.</p>
            <h3>Links to Third Party Web Sites</h3>
            <p>
                We may provide links or automatically redirect you to third party web sites that
                do not operate under this Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement
                presented on our site, you may be taken to a web site that LeadFlash.com does
                not operate or control. You should review the privacy statements and terms of use
                of all third party web sites you access. These third party web sites may independently
                solicit and collect information from you. On occasion, those third party web sites
                may provide us with information about your use of those sites.</p>
            <h3>Changes</h3>
            <p>
