  	<h2>LearnStreet Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the  web site and online services (the “Website”) operated by LearnStreet, Inc., a  501(c)(3) organization (“LearnStreet”). LearnStreet values the privacy of our  members and others who visit and use the Website (individually, “You” or  collectively, “Users”). We take your privacy seriously and make it a priority  to protect personally identifiable information that we obtain from and about individuals  both online and off-line.</p>
     <p> This Privacy  Policy describes what information we gather from you, how we use that  information, and what we do to protect it. By using the Website (whether or not  you are a registered member), you expressly consent to the information handling  practices described in this policy. If you do not want information about you to  be used in the manner set forth in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the  Website.</p>
     <p> This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the <a href="/terms">LearnStreet Terms of Service</a>. Your use of  the Website and any personal information you provide on the Website are subject  to the terms of this Privacy Policy and&nbsp;<a href="/terms">LearnStreet’s Terms of Service</a>.</p>
     <h4>The Information LearnStreet Collects:</h4>
     <ol>
       <li><strong>User-provided Information:</strong>&nbsp;When you browse  and use the Website, you may provide to LearnStreet what is generally called  “personally identifiable” information (such as your name, password, gender,  email address, postal mailing address, home/mobile telephone number). You will  also be able to add a picture of yourself. If you decide to register through or  otherwise grant access to a third party social networking or authentication  service that we may make available (“Authentication Service”), such as Facebook  Connect or Google, LearnStreet may also collect such “personally identifiable”  information that you have provided to the Authentication Service from the  account you have with the Authentication Service. You may revoke LearnStreet’s  access to your account on the Authentication Service at any time by updating  the appropriate settings in the account preferences of the respective  Authentication Service. From time to time, LearnStreet may also ask you  optionally to provide other information. If you choose to provide such  information, during registration or otherwise, you are giving LearnStreet the  permission to use and store it consistent with this policy. Therefore, please  understand that when you sign in with LearnStreet, you are not anonymous to us.</li>
       <li><strong>“Cookies” Information:</strong>&nbsp;When you visit  the Website, whether or not you are a registered member, we may send one or  more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters  – to your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on a  website. LearnStreet may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A  session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie  remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on  subsequent visits to the Website. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please  review your web browser “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your  cookie settings. However, without cookies you will not have access to certain  services on the Website. Third party advertisements displayed in connection  with the Website may also contain cookies set by internet advertisers. We do  not control these cookies and users of the Website should check the privacy  policy of the advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies.</li>
       <li><strong>“Automatically Collected” Information:</strong>&nbsp;When you use the Website, we may automatically record certain  information from your browser by using different types of technology, including  standard log files, “clear gifs” or “web beacons.” This “automatically collected”  information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type,  internet service provider (ISP), referring or exit pages, click stream data,  operating system and the dates and times that you visit the Website.  Additionally, we may record certain information regarding your use of features  LearnStreet may make available on the Website, such as the number of problems  you have attempted, the number of videos you have viewed and the amount of time  spent to complete a problem.</li>
       <li><strong>Third Party Web Beacons:</strong>&nbsp;We may also  implement third party content, such as advertising, on the Website that uses  “clear gifs,” “web beacons,” or other similar techniques, which allow the third  party content provider to read and write cookies to your browser, or implement  similar tracking mechanisms, in connection with your viewing of that third  party content displayed on the Website. This information is collected directly  by the third party, and LearnStreet does not participate in that data  transmission. Information collected by third parties in this manner is subject  to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.</li>
       <li class="last"><strong>Information from Other Sources:</strong>&nbsp;We may also obtain information, including personally  identifiable information, from third parties and sources other than the  Website. If we combine or associate information from other sources with  personally identifiable information that we collect through the Website, we  will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information in  accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>The Way LearnStreet Uses Information:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>LearnStreet  uses the information that you provide or that we collect in order to establish  and enhance our relationship with you. LearnStreet generally uses the  information you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and  provide all of the features and services found on the Website. If you have  given LearnStreet consent, we may use your personally identifiable information  to provide you with information about LearnStreet’s features, services and  other offerings that may be of interest to you. We may also send information or  offers to groups of users on behalf of other businesses. Under certain  circumstances (for example if you win a contest) we may post your personally  identifiable information on the Website. However, we will notify you of this  possibility when collecting personally identifiable information or we will  obtain your consent. We may share your personally identifiable information with  certain other websites that we link to (and that you click upon) in order to  enhance your experience in connection with the Website.</li>
        <li>LearnStreet  uses all of the information that you provide or that we collect from Users to  understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to  improve the way the Website works and looks, and to create new features and  functionality.</li>
        <li>LearnStreet may  use “cookies” information to: (a) remember your information so that you will  not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the  Website; (b) provide customized third-party advertisements, content, and  information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of third-party marketing campaigns;  (d) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and  pages viewed; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any  promotions or other activities.</li>
        <li>If you have  registered as a member and given LearnStreet consent, we may share your  personally identifiable information with advertisers, business partners, and  other entities that are not affiliated with LearnStreet who would like to send  you information about their products and services. We do not share personally  identifiable information with other third-party organizations for their  marketing or promotional use without your consent or except as part of a  specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in.</li>
        <li class="last">LearnStreet’s  employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain  access to the personally identifiable information you may provide to register  as a member of LearnStreet. We may share your personally identifiable  information with companies that provide services to us, including outside  contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (for  example, contest and sweepstakes administration), but they may only use your  personally identifiable information to provide us with a specific service and  not for any other purpose.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>When LearnStreet Discloses Information:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>LearnStreet  discloses automatically collected and other aggregate  non-personally-identifiable information with interested third parties to assist  such parties in understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for  certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or  functionality on the Website.</li>
        <li>LearnStreet  enables you to share your User Postings with other Users of the Website, such  as Users of the Website that you choose to register as your Coach and Users  associated with your Educational Organization. LearnStreet may also permit you  to share your User Postings publicly on the Website. If your User Postings are  shared with other Users, any personally identifiable information that you  choose to include in, or is associated with, such User Postings will be  accessible by such Users. Once you make your personally identifiable  information available to others in any of these ways, it may be collected and  used by the recipients without restriction.</li>
        <li>LearnStreet  enables Users to share information and resources. If you are a User subscribing  to the Website and you consent, LearnStreet may disclose certain personally  identifiable information to other Users of the Website, such as Users  registered as Coaches and Users associated with your Educational Organization.  If you consent, LearnStreet may also share information about your use of  certain Website features with other Users of the Website, such as sharing your  activity history with your Coach or Users associated with your Educational  Organization.</li>
        <li>LearnStreet may  also disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith  belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws  (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other  government subpoena, or warrant. In some cases, we may make such disclosures  without first providing notice to Users.</li>
        <li>LearnStreet  also reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good  faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability;  protect LearnStreet from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate  and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; to assist  government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the  Website; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of LearnStreet,  our Users, or others.</li>
        <li class="last">In the event  that LearnStreet is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve  the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information  that we have collected from Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or  other change of control.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Your Choices:</h4>
      <p>You may, of  course, decline to share your personally-identifiable information with  LearnStreet, in which case LearnStreet will not be able to provide to you some  of the features and functionality found on the Website. If you register as a  member of LearnStreet, you may update, correct, or delete your profile  information and preferences at any time by going to your account settings page.</p>
      <p> To protect your  privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before  granting you account access or making corrections to your information. YOU ARE  RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECRECY OF YOUR UNIQUE PASSWORD AND ACCOUNT  INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES.</p>
      <h4>Third-Party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites:</h4>
      <p>The Website may  be linked to internet websites operated by other companies. Some of these  websites may be co-branded with our name or logo, even though they are not  operated or maintained by us. LearnStreet may also permit other companies,  called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within  the Website. These third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to  send, directly to your browser, some of the advertisements and links that  appear on the Website. These advertisers may automatically receive your IP  address if this happens. These advertisers may also use other technologies  (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of  their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.</p>
      <p> You should  consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party websites and third  party ad servers or ad networks. LearnStreet’s privacy policy does not apply  to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other third party advertisers  or web sites. Please be aware that LearnStreet does not warn you when you have  chosen to link through to another website from the Website.</p>
      <h4>Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy:</h4>
  <p>Protecting the privacy of  young children is especially important. For that reason, LearnStreet does not  knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information on the  Website from persons under 13 years-of-age unless LearnStreet reasonably  believes the child’s parent has consented to the use of the Website. If  LearnStreet learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less  than 13-years-of-age has been collected on the Website without parental  consent, then LearnStreet will take the appropriate steps to delete this  information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under  the age of 13 has a registered account with the Website, then you may alert  LearnStreet at <a href="mailto:privacy@LearnStreet.com">privacy@LearnStreet.co</a>m and request that  LearnStreet delete that child’s personal information from its systems. </p>
  <h4>Our Commitment to Data Security:</h4>
  <p>LearnStreet  uses certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the  integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure  or warrant the security of any information you transmit to LearnStreet, and you  do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information,  LearnStreet makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our  systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such  information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of  any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
  <p>If LearnStreet  learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you  electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. LearnStreet  may post a notice on the Website if a security breach occurs. Depending on  where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security  breach in writing.</p>
  <h4>International Visitors:</h4>
  <p>The Website is  intended solely for visitors located within the United States. If you  nonetheless choose to use the Website from the European Union or other regions  of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from  U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your personally  identifiable information outside of those regions to the United States and by  providing your personally identifiable information on the Website you consent  to that transfer.</p>
  <h4>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy:</h4>
  <p>This Privacy  Policy may be revised periodically without further notice to you and this will  be reflected by a “Last Updated” date above. Please revisit this page to stay  aware of any changes. Your continued use of the Website constitutes your  agreement to this Privacy Policy and any future revisions.</p>
  <h4>Contact Information:</h4>
  <p>Please contact LearnStreet with any questions or comments about  this Privacy Policy, your personal information, our third-party disclosure  practices, or your consent choices by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@LearnStreet.com">privacy@LearnStreet.com</a> or by mail at:  LearnStreet,  <a href="mailto:info@learnstreet.com">info@learnstreet.com</a>.</p>
