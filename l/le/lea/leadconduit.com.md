# LeadConduit - Track, Validate, Deliver Internet Leads

###### I. Information We Collect: Affiliates And Advertisers. 

A. Personally Identifiable Information. 

LeadConduit™, operated by ActiveProspect, Inc., ("[ActiveProspect](http://www.activeprospect.com/)") collects personally identifiable information from all Affiliates and Advertisers (collectively “Users") wishing to work with us. The collection of this information is a part of our normal business practices. Users or their representatives will be asked to provide personally identifiable data through the signup and registration process. Examples of personally identifiable data that may be requested include name, address, phone number, email address, social security number, tax ID number, credit card number, etc. ActiveProspect will never request or collect data from a user on subject areas including medical/health conditions; racial or ethnic origin; political, religious or philosophical beliefs or affiliations; trade union membership or sex life. 

B. Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

ActiveProspect may use cookies and log files to optimize and personalize the Users' experience and allow ActiveProspect to monitor site traffic patterns. 

###### II. Information Sharing 

ActiveProspect does not use any personally identifiable data about a user for profiling purposes. All personally identifiable information that ActiveProspect collects from Users is principally intended for administration needs (e.g., accounting and reporting), for which purpose such data are required. 

ActiveProspect may receive personally identifiable information of third parties that Users have collected for transmittal to other Users. Each user has agreed that it has provided notice to, and obtained consent from, any third party individuals whose personal data it supplies to ActiveProspect with regard to: (a) the purposes for which such third party's personal data has been collected; (b) the intended recipients or categories of recipients of the third party's personal data; (c) which of the third party's data are obligatory and which data, if any, are voluntary; and (d) how the third party can access and, if necessary, rectify the data held about them. ActiveProspect may transmit such third party personally identifiable information to the intended recipients or categories of recipients as requested by such third party. 

While ActiveProspect strongly encourages Users to adopt responsible approaches to online marketing, ActiveProspect is not responsible for the information practices of Users or their partners. The collection, use, and disclosure of information by Users and partners are subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from ActiveProspect's policy. 

Periodically ActiveProspect may use Users' personally identifiable information in order to communicate via email newsletters or other avenues to offer information and other communications to assist in business-related activities. In the event that a user wishes not to have their personally identifiable information used for these purposes, they may elect to opt-out from future communications. For more information on opting-out please see the "User Choice And Access" section below. 

Except as may be agreed between ActiveProspect and a user, all personally identifiable information data provided by individual Users will be kept in strict confidence by ActiveProspect and will be treated with the same level of respect and care that they treat other proprietary information and trade secrets. ActiveProspect will never sell, rent, exchange or barter any personally identifiable user information to or with any third party for financial gain or marketing purposes. ActiveProspect may, from time to time, provide such information to certain third-party administrative vendors for efficiency purposes in providing administrative or program management services such as billing, delivery, and payouts. Any third-party vendor so used has agreed to protect the confidentiality of information provided by ActiveProspect. 

ActiveProspect may release account and any other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to respond to a subpoena or otherwise comply with the law or protect the rights, property, or safety of ActiveProspect or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection. 

###### III. User Choice And Access

When a user registers for services with ActiveProspect, personally identifiable information is required as a part of doing business. ActiveProspect's primary intent in collecting personally identifiable information is for administrative purposes including accounting and reporting. However, ActiveProspect may periodically use personally identifiable information for marketing and communication purposes targeted to our Users. Users wishing not to receive such communications from ActiveProspect may do so by "opting-out" at the time of the communication.

When a user logs onto LeadConduit, a "Cookie" is placed within their computer. The purpose of the Cookie is to allow ActiveProspect to validate the identity of the user and maintain the security and privacy of the user's account data. This Cookie is required to log into LeadConduit and there is no method to opt-out of this Cookie. 

###### IV. Security

ActiveProspect employs industry standard security measures to ensure the security of all data. Any data that is stored on ActiveProspect's servers is treated as proprietary and confidential and is not available to the public. ActiveProspect has an internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of user data, allowing access only to those employees or third parties who have a need to know such information. ActiveProspect routinely evaluates its data security practices to identify security threats or opportunities for improvement. 

No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of ActiveProspect to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, ActiveProspect cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. You acknowledge and assume this risk when communicating with ActiveProspect. 

###### V. Consent and Changes

ActiveProspect may find it necessary or be legally obligated to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post those changes on this page and update the effective date so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. Any changes will become effective 30 days following its posting, unless otherwise stated. Except as otherwise required by law, modifications to this Privacy Policy will not affect the privacy of data collected by ActiveProspect prior to the effective date of the policy change.
