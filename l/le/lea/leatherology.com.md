You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing the [Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

## Security of Data

We take security seriously and make every effort to protect your personal information. When you purchase something from our Website, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to guard the information you provide us. SSL encrypts certain purchasing information you input. We do not store credit card information on any computers, but rather use tokenization process to ensure your purchase is secured.

Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, to the extent permitted by law, we do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our web sites, and you do so at your own risk. We do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.

By using the Site or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Site. If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically or via mail.
