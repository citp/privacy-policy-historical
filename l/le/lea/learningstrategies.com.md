# Learning Strategies Corporation Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy 

         This is how we will handle information we learn about you from your visit to our website. It is based on how all of us at Learning Strategies Corporation want to be treated when we visit other websites. 

         The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting our site. 

If you visit our site to read or download information: 

         We collect and store only the following information about you: the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account, or princeton.edu if you are connecting from Princeton University's domain); the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site. 

         We use the information we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site, and to help us make our site more useful. 

If you identify yourself by sending an email or ordering from our site: 

         You may decide to send us personally identifying information, for example, in an email or an order. We will use this information to better serve you. Occasionally we may send you product announcements or tips on getting more benefit from our products-these may come via the mail or email. At any time, you can tell us not to contact you in this manner. 

         We want to be very clear: We will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us. 

Will we disclose any personal information we collect to outside parties? 

         We may occasionally provide limited personal information to trustworthy third parties for direct mail offers and to make our future marketing efforts more efficient, but you can tell us not to. Such information includes your name and mailing address. This information may be combined with demographic information and past purchase information. We will never include your telephone numbers or credit card information. 

         We may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. 

         Please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20030623043852id_/http%3A//www.learningstrategies.com/ReachUs.html) with any questions or concerns.
