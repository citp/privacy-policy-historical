# Privacy Statement | learndirect

**Scope**

This notice provides a summary of the full learndirect Privacy Statement. Both the notice and the learndirect Privacy Statement apply to information collected by learndirect Limited via the [www.learndirect.com ](http://www.learndirect.com/)website and in any manner described in the learndirect Privacy Statement.

  * [Part A ](http://www.learndirect.com/help/legal-information/privacy-statement/#parta)applies if you enrol as a learner on a learndirect course
  * [Part B ](http://www.learndirect.com/help/legal-information/privacy-statement/#partb)applies if you are purchasing online Course Materials



## **Part A**

**Personal Information**

We collect personal data about you when you enrol as a learner. ([Further Information](http://www.learndirect.com/help/legal-information/privacy-statement/#2)). At enrolment, we may ask you for [sensitive personal data](http://www.learndirect.com/help/legal-information/privacy-statement/#7)and for your consent to use it for a specific purpose. If you do not wish to provide this information, you may select the Not Known/Not Provided or Prefer not to say option.

We share some of your personal data with the Skills Funding Agency. The SFA through their Learner Registration Service allocates Unique Learner Numbers (ULNs) which enable individuals to access their participation and achievement data. The SFA will share your learndirect Ltd participation and achievement data with other organisations if you tell learndirect Ltd that you are happy for the SFA to do so. ([Further information](http://www.learndirect.com/help/legal-information/privacy-statement/#miap)).

We share some personal information with Job Centre Plus if you have been referred to learndirect Ltd by them. ([Further information](http://www.learndirect.com/help/legal-information/privacy-statement/#_Third_parties_and))

If government funding is available for your course, we collect personal data from you to see if you can have that funding. ([Further information](http://www.learndirect.com/help/legal-information/privacy-statement/#3)).

When you access your course materials we collect information about how you use those materials.

We collect certain personal data about you when you enter competitions. ([Further information](http://www.learndirect.com/help/legal-information/privacy-statement/#5)).

You may provide us with further personal data if you use one of our learning or communications facilities or use one of our online skills tests. ([Further information](http://www.learndirect.com/help/legal-information/privacy-statement/#6)).

We use cookies and other technologies to keep track of how you interact with our website and to target advertising.  For further information about this please see our [learndirect Use of Cookies Statement](http://www.learndirect.com/help/legal-information/how-we-use-cookies/).

**Purposes and Disclosures**

We use your personal information to deal with your queries, to provide you with the services you request, to determine whether you are eligible for government funding (if available), customer feedback and for general statistics and research.

Depending on the preferences indicated by you, we may use your personal data to contact you about learndirect developments and offers. ([More information](http://www.learndirect.com/help/legal-information/privacy-statement/#16)).

We may disclose your personal data to your sponsor, if you are being sponsored by your employer or by a trade organisation or other group.

We may disclose your information to third parties who may take over some or all of the learndirect business in the future.

We may disclose your information to certain government agencies in connection with the funding of your course. ([Further information](http://www.learndirect.com/help/legal-information/privacy-statement/#6)).

If you enrol in a learndirect centre we will disclose your personal data to the approved service provider that will be delivering and supporting your learning (who may use it for any of the above purposes) Following registration and enrolment, either in a learndirect centre or online, all of our approved service providers will have access to your name, date of birth, address, username, learner reference number and details of which learndirect courses you have enrolled on in the past.

**Your Rights and Choices**

You can request that:

  * your details not be used for marketing purposes;
  * we provide you with a copy of the information we hold about you;
  * we correct inaccuracies in your information.



The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) strengthens your rights over how companies use your data.

We ensure Data Subjects rights under the GDPR are protected by ensuring a data subject can request:

The right to be informed  | The right to be informed encompasses our obligation to provide ‘fair processing information’, typically through a privacy notice. It emphasises the need for transparency over how we use personal data of individuals. 

The information we supply about the processing of personal data must be:

  * concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible;
  * written in clear and plain language, particularly if addressed to a child; and
  * free of charge.

  
---|---  
The right of access  | 

  * Individuals have the right to access their personal data and supplementary information. This is known as a Subject Access Request (SAR).
  * The right of access allows individuals to be aware of and verify the lawfulness of the processing.



Under the GDPR, individuals will have the right to obtain:

  * confirmation that their data is being processed;
  * access to their personal data; and
  * other supplementary information – this largely corresponds to the information that should be provided in a privacy notice.



We must provide a copy of the information free of charge. However, we can charge a ‘reasonable fee’ when a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, particularly if it is repetitive.

Information must be provided without delay and at the latest within one month of receipt. We will be able to extend the period of compliance by a further two months where requests are complex or numerous.

Certain data may not be disclosed where a relevant exemption applies. We will provide an explanation and a right of appeal in these circumstances.

Where we are not the Data Controller, we will forward the request to the Data Controller and otherwise assist in answering the request, where appropriate. For example, where we are a Data Processor we will provide information we hold on behalf of the Data Controller to the Data Controller within a reasonable amount of time to allow them to respond to the request within the statutory time limits.

For more information about SAR process, please refer to learndirect Subject Access Request process.  
  
The right to rectification  | 

  * The GDPR gives individuals the right to have personal data rectified.
  * Personal data can be rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete.
  * We must respond within one month. This can be extended by two months where the request for rectification is complex.
  * If we cannot take any action in response to a request for rectification, we must explain why to the individual, informing them of their right to complain to the supervisory authority (ICO) and to a judicial remedy.

  
The right to erasure  | 

  * The right to erasure is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’.
  * The broad principle behind this right is to enable an individual to request the deletion or removal of personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing.



Individuals have a right to have personal data erased and to prevent processing in specific circumstances:

  * Where the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was originally collected/processed;
  * When the individual withdraws consent;
  * When the individual objects to the processing and there is no overriding legitimate interest for continuing the processing;
  * The personal data was unlawfully processed (i.e. otherwise in breach of the GDPR);
  * The personal data has to be erased in order to comply with a legal obligation.



We can refuse to comply with a request for erasure where the personal data is processed for the following reasons:

  * to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information;
  * to comply with a legal obligation for the performance of a public interest task or exercise of official authority;
  * for public health purposes in the public interest;
  * archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific research historical research or statistical purposes; or
  * the exercise or defence of legal claims.

  
The right to restrict processing  | 

  * Individuals have a right to ‘block’ or suppress processing of personal data.
  * When processing is restricted, we are permitted to store the personal data to comply with legal or contractual obligations, but not further process it.
  * We can retain just enough information about the individual to ensure that the restriction is respected in future.



We will be required to restrict the processing of personal data in the following circumstances:

  * Where an individual contests the accuracy of the personal data, we should restrict the processing until we have verified the accuracy of the personal data;
  * Where an individual has objected to the processing (where it was necessary for the performance of a public interest task or purpose of legitimate interests), and we are considering whether our organisation’s legitimate grounds override those of the individual;
  * When processing is unlawful and the individual opposes erasure and requests restriction instead;
  * If we no longer need the personal data but the individual requires the data to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim;



We must inform individuals when we decide to lift a restriction on processing.  
  
The right to data portability  | The right to data portability allows individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data for their own purposes across different services. 

It allows them to move, copy or transfer personal data easily from one IT environment to another in a safe and secure way, without hindrance to usability.

The right to data portability only applies:

  * to personal data an individual has provided to a controller;
  * where the processing is based on the individual’s consent or for the performance of a contract; and
  * when processing is carried out by automated means;



We must provide the personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine readable form. Open formats include CSV files. Machine readable means that the information is structured so that software can extract specific elements of the data. This enables other organisations to use the data.

We must respond without undue delay, and within one month. This can be extended by two months where the request is complex or we receive a number of requests. We must inform the individual within one month of the receipt of the request and explain why the extension is necessary.

The information must be provided free of charge.  
  
The right to object  | If a data subject believes that the processing of personal information about them is causing, or is likely to cause, substantial and unwarranted damage or distress to them or another person, they may notify the organisation in writing to request learndirect to put a stop to the processing of that information. 

Individuals have the right to object to:

  * processing based on legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public interest/exercise of official authority (including profiling);
  * direct marketing (including profiling); and
  * processing for purposes of scientific/ historical research and statistics.



We must stop processing the personal data unless:

  * we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing, which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the individual; or
  * the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.



We must inform individuals of their right to object “at the point of first communication” and in our privacy notice. This must be “explicitly brought to the attention of the data subject and shall be presented clearly and separately from any other information”.  
  
Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling | The GDPR applies to all automated individual decision-making and profiling. This may be not applicable to learndirect if we are not using any automated means to process personal data. 

Automated individual decision-making (making a decision solely by automated means without any human involvement)

Profiling (automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain things about an individual). Profiling can be part of an automated decision-making process.

We can only carry out this type of decision-making where the decision is:

  * necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract; or
  * authorised by Union or Member state law applicable to the controller; or
  * based on the individual’s explicit consent.

**Giving information for other people**

When you give us information about another person, the other person must have agreed to let :

  * us process all their personal data; and
  * you receive any data protection notices for them.



When you send information for someone else, you are confirming that you have told them :

  * which data they must give;
  * which information is voluntary; and
  * how they can access and, if necessary, correct the data we hold about them.



**The information we collect during the enrolment process**  
**  in a **learndirect **  centre**

When you enrol with us, you (or the person enrolling you) must tell us:

  * your full name;
  * your gender
  * your date of birth;
  * your address (and correspondence address if different);
  * primary telephone number;
  * your employment status;
  * where you heard about us;
  * if you have done any learning in the last three years.



We also request other information including your title, middle name, email address, National Insurance number and if you are a Welsh speaker, but you don’t have to give us these details. Following enrolment via the website, we, or our approved service providers, may request additional personal data from you in order to further support your learning. You do not have to provide this information, but if you do not, you may not get the most out of your learning. However, we ask you to tell us whether you have achieved Level 2 in English and Maths.

Before you enrol, we will give you a username and ask you for a password. You will also be given a learner reference number and asked to give the answer to a question you choose which will identify you.

_**online**_

_Before enrolment_

  * your full name;
  * your date of birth;
  * your address (and correspondence address if different);
  * primary telephone number;
  * your employment status;
  * email address;
  * your education so far;
  * your citizenship status; and
  * where you live and how long you have lived there.



We use this information to check whether you are eligible for funding. If you are not eligible this information will be destroyed.

_At enrolment_

We will call you at the time of your choice to check all the above details with you and may request additional information, such as where you heard about us and if you have done any learning in the last three years, other information we may collect is set out in this Privacy Statement. You will need a user name and password to access your course materials. Your user name is your email address and you can either choose your own password or we will give you one which you must change when you first log in. If you are already registered on the learndirect community you will use the same user name and password to access your learning.

Please note that when you enrol on a learndirect course that leads to a qualification such as an NVQ, we send non sensitive personal information to the relevant awarding bodies so that they can undertake the administration associated with your qualification.

**Other information we collect, if you enrol in a learning centre, to see if you can have government funding**

If government funding is available for any of our courses, you need to answer some other questions to see if you are eligible for funding. If you wish to take advantage of any such funding, you will be asked about:

  * your age;
  * your education so far;
  * your citizenship status; and
  * where you live and how long you have lived there.



We, or our approved service providers, may require additional information from you in order to support an application for funding. If you do not want to provide us with this information, we will not be able to offer you the course at the reduced price.

**Learner File**

When you start your learning we or your Service Provider will create a Learner File to hold the documents which relate to your learning and evidence of proof of identity and funding eligibility. As you progress through your learning other documents, including some of your course work, may be held on this file.

**The information we collect when you access course materials**

We collect information about how you use course materials to monitor your learning and improve our users’ learning experience.

**The information we collect when you enter competitions**

From time to time we may run competitions and promotions on the website. If you enter these, we may ask for your name, address, email address and username so that we can administer and control the competition and, of course, notify the winners.

**Other information we collect**

If you require a free information pack, we ask you to provide us with the information on the “request more information” form on the website, including:

  * Title;
  * Full name;
  * Full address;
  * An indication of courses in which you are interested;
  * Whether you would like to know where your nearest learndirectcentres are;
  * Where you heard about us.



You can also decide to give us your home and mobile telephone numbers and your email address but you only need to do this if you want us and/or our approved service providers to contact you about learndirectdevelopments and offers in this way.

If you are not registered as a learndirect learner but use one of our online tests to test your skills, we ask you to provide your full name and email address. This information is not retained by us but is used only when sending you your test results.

You may also provide personal data through:

  * calls to our helplines;
  * letters and email;
  * customer feedback forms;
  * the learndirect“Community”; or
  * other learning or communications facility offered by us.



* We may record calls to helplines and communications via on-line tools for quality and training purposes only. We will store calls for about six months and we will keep them confidential. In general, if you contact us, we may keep a record of your query or complaint for a reasonable time in case you contact us again.

**Sensitive personal data**

Sensitive personal data includes details of your:

  * race or ethnic origin
  * political opinions
  * religious or other beliefs
  * trade-union membership
  * physical or mental health
  * sexual life; or
  * criminal record (including information about criminal proceedings and suspected criminal activities).



At or before enrolment you may be asked for sensitive personal information but you do not have to provide it. If you decide to provide sensitive personal data we will use it for the purposes described in the section below.   If you do not want to provide it, or do not want us to use it for these purposes then when enrolling online please select the “prefer not to say” option or if enrolling in a learndirect centre select the “Not Known/Not Provided” option.

You may also volunteer sensitive personal data to us or our approved service providers, for example, when you submit a query or comment to us via the website or some other means of communication. If you do so, you explicitly consent to our using such information as described in this Privacy Statement.

**How we use the information we collect**

We use your personal information and your Learner File:

  * to answer your queries or complaints;
  * to deliver our services, for example on-line tools to test your skills;
  * to provide the learndirect“Community” facility;
  * to support your learning;
  * to provide course materials;
  * to carry out administration;
  * to improve the quality of services;
  * to support your application for government funding;
  * to obtain customer feedback;
  * for general statistics and research;
  * for obtaining any relevant professional advice;
  * as may be required by law or in connection with legal proceedings (including where we intend to take legal proceedings), or as may be necessary to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights.



**Third parties and sponsors**

To achieve the purposes set out in this privacy statement we may need to share your information and Learner File with our service providers (including our approved learning providers), agents, professional advisors and auditors and to your tutor(s). When you enrol on a course with a service provider in a learndirect centre, the service provider will be delivering and supporting your learning. Following enrolment via a centre or online, all of our approved service providers will have access to your name, date of birth, address, username, learner reference number and which learndirect courses you have enrolled on in the past as well as details relating to these learndirect courses to help us deliver our services to you.  In a limited number of circumstances it may be necessary to allow a new Service Provider access to all your personal information for example if your existing Service Provider no longer provides learndirect services.

We may also give your information to third parties who may take over part or all of the learndirect business in the future, but only for the purposes outlined in this privacy statement. If your employer, trade organisation or other organisation is sponsoring or supporting you, we may give the personal information we have collected to your sponsor to monitor your learning.

Communications between you and your tutor using any of the tools or functions we make available to you (including unopened messages sent via our messaging system) may be monitored by learndirect staff to check the quality of tutor support. learndirect staff and auditors may also access these communications when we want to investigate or audit learner funding arrangements.

**Referral Partners**

If we have received your details as a referral from one of our partners we may be required by the referral partner to provide them with updates on the following areas:

  * Attendance
  * Progress
  * Achievement/completion
  * Outcome/destination
  * Withdrawal



**Job Centre Plus Referrals**

If we or our Service Providers receive your details via a Skills Conditionality Referral from Job Centre Plus we are obliged to keep them informed of your progress.  We will complete a Starter/Leaver notification form that contains details of the course being taken, when started and an anticipated end date.  You will be asked to sign this to confirm you have started the learning prior to it being sent to Job Centre Plus for processing.  When you stop learning for whatever reason the remaining boxes of the Starter/Leaver notification form are completed and returned to Job Centre Plus.  In certain circumstances this may result in sanctions being applied by Job Centre Plus, details of these are available from www.direct.gov.uk.

**Keeping you informed**

We, and our approved service providers, will use your information to send you regular updates about:

  * our services and materials;
  * additions to the website; and
  * specific activities such as customer feedback surveys and competitions.



If you enrol on a learndirect course you will periodically be sent customer feedback surveys.  If you do not wish to be contacted for marketing purposes untick the relevant boxes on the ’contact permissions’ page. If at any time, you change your mind about receiving updates, you can change your preferences using “edit your details” on your learner home page.

If you are simply requesting a free information pack, you can invite us to send you updates by ticking the appropriate boxes on the “request more information” page. If you change your mind about us contacting you for this purpose, please ring us on 0800 101 901 or [email us](mailto:enquiries@learndirect.net?Subject=Privacy%20Statement%20query).

We will never use your sensitive personal data for marketing purposes without your express consent.

**Funding**

We, and our approved service providers, may use your personal data to process or to support any application made for funding associated with your learning. For these purposes we, or our approved service providers, will share the information you supply with the Skills Funding Agency in England. The Skills Funding Agency may in turn share it with the European Social Fund, or other government agencies that may provide funding for your course, including the [Welsh Assembly Government](http://www.wales.gov.uk/) for learners who enrol in Welsh centres. We may use a third party service to verify your identity for funding eligibility. If you are a learner between the ages of 16-19 years of age (or up to 25 years of age for learners with learning difficulties or disabilities), we are required by the Skills Funding Agency to notify Connexions when you leave, or intend to leave learning. We, or our approved service providers, may also share it with the Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted) so that it can check our use of public monies. If you do not want us to use your personal data for these purposes, we will not be able to offer you the course at the reduced price.

At the point this information is collected you will be asked to indicate if you do not wish to be contacted by the Skills Funding Agency or its partners in respect of courses, surveys and research. You can change your choices at any time by talking to your tutor.  Please read the SFA Privacy Notice below.

We, or the government agency providing funding for your course, may use your personal data and Learner File to investigate a suspected misuse of public monies or other fraudulent activity by any person relating to your learning activity. In doing so, we, or the government agency providing funding for your course, may disclose your information to other government agencies (e.g. the [Department for Work and Pensions](http://www.dwp.gov.uk/)) to establish whether there has been any duplication of funding for your course. We may also contact you for the purposes of any such investigation.

**ESFA Privacy Notice 2017 to 2018**

This privacy notice is issued by the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA), on behalf of the Secretary of State for the Department of Education (DfE). It is to inform learners how their personal information will be used by the DfE, the ESFA (an executive agency of the DfE) and any successor bodies to these organisations. For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998, the DfE is the data controller for personal data processed by the ESFA..

**How We Use Your Personal Information**  
Your personal information is used by the DfE to exercise its functions and to meet its statutory responsibilities, including under the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 and to create and maintain a unique learner number (ULN) and a personal learning record (PLR).

Your information may be shared with third parties for education, training, employment and well-being related purposes, including for research. This will only take place where the law allows it and the sharing is in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998.

The English European Social Fund (ESF) Managing Authority (or agents acting on its behalf) may contact you in order for them to carry out research and evaluation to inform the effectiveness of training.

You can opt out from being contacted for other purposes by choosing a relevant option in the ESFA Contact Restriction fields which will be discussed with you when you register with learndirect.

Further information about use of and access to your personal data, and details of organisations with whom we regularly share data are available at:

<https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esfa-privacy-notice>

**Statistics**

We and/or the approved service providers delivering and supporting your learning are also required to provide statistics to all of the government agencies mentioned under the heading ‘Funding’ and to the [Department for Business, Innovation and Skills](http://www.bis.gov.uk/), in order that they can carry out checks on our funding arrangements and our performance and for research and statistical purposes. This helps us, and our approved service providers, to maintain our funding. Where such information is supplied, it is provided in an aggregated manner so that whilst such authorities may be aware of, for example, the number, geographic location and sex of persons using learndirect, you cannot be personally identified from this information.

However, we may provide information that identifies you (your name, date of birth, address and postcode) to the Department of Work and Pensions so that they can check whether learndirect learners have progressed into employment and compile statistical information about such progression.

## **Part B**

  9. **Terms applying if you enrol for a  **learndirect **course  at a Service Provider**



**These terms and conditions (‘Terms’) apply to your learning when you enrol on a  **learndirect **  course in a learning centre**

learndirect **  and your learning centre**

learndirect

learndirect is the trading name of learndirect Ltd, which is the provider of your learning. That service to you includes the learndirect website, your course on the website or any learndirect off-line materials, and the learndirect learner helpline.

**Your Service Provider**

learndirect has contracted with your service provider to support you through enrolment, use of computers, tutor support while you are learning, and assessment for your qualification. You can learn at the learning centre or online or a mix of the two; your service provider will be able to provide you with support whichever method you use.

**For the purposes of these Terms**

‘ **advisor’  **the person who provides general support while you are learning

‘ **course fee** ‘ means the fee you may be asked to pay for this course.

‘ **course’  **means this course that you are signing up to learn. In the learndirect system it is referred to as a ‘programme’ because it usually contains more than one piece of learning, and it will prepare you for your qualification.

‘ **enrol** ‘ means the process of enrolling for a course.

‘ **learning centre’**  means the centre where you are enrolled.

**‘SFA’**   the Skills Funding Agency which pays for a lot of the learning.

**‘Service Provider’  **means the organisation contracted by learndirect Ltd to provide your services.

‘ **services** ‘ means the products and services we and the service provider supply to  you including;  this Website where your learning takes place, the online course materials you use on the Website, any off-line materials we supply, any help-line services we provide to learners, and the tutor and other support provided to you.

‘ **tutor’**  the person who provides you specialist support for your course

‘ **we** ‘ and  **‘us** ‘ means learndirectLimited. learndirect **  is the brand name which **learndirect **  Ltd uses for its learning services.**

‘ **you** ‘ means the learner.

**Enrolment**

Your Service Provider will help you to choose the correct course. It will assess your skills and knowledge and provide advice and information before you start learning to make sure you choose the right course.

If you are eligible for government funding to pay, or help to pay, for the course, you must provide your service provider with relevant evidence about yourself and your circumstances, and we will obtain that funding for your learning.

If the SFA says that you must pay for a part of the course, your service provider will collect the fee on behalf of learndirect, and give you a receipt.

You must follow the terms and conditions of the course.

The Service Provider will not make other charges to you, or ask for any deposits, for learndirect learning.

Your Service Provider will provide you with the online course materials for the course (and off-line courses if used) and access to learndirectonline systems and the tools and resources for learners you will find there.

By accessing your course you will be deemed to have accepted these Terms and the terms and conditions of the Learning Agreement.

When you have signed the Learning Agreement with us, your Service Provider will provide you with a tutor. Your tutor will provide support and guidance to you during your course.

**Your course**

Your course is a mixture of online software, (or off-line course materials) tools and information on the Website, and tutor support from your service provider. The course is designed to help you to achieve the qualification you have chosen with support from your service provider.

Whether you pay a fee or not, you are not ‘buying’ the course. You are being licensed to ‘use’ the course while you are on the course. You cannot ‘keep’ the course for ever. You cannot give or sell the course or any of the learning materials to anyone else. The course always remains the property of learndirect **.**

**Assessment** :

Assessment is an important part of your course. It is the only way to get the qualification that you want when you have finished your learning. It may be the online test for maths and English, or a portfolio if you are doing a vocational qualification.

If you are doing an English or maths course, your service provider will help prepare you for your Skills for Life test, and will arrange with you a suitable time and date to take your test. There is no charge for this service.

If you are doing an NVQ, your learndirect assessor will help you prepare and submit your portfolio. Once you have been assessed and passed, you will get your certificate for your qualification.

There is no extra charge for assessment and certification.

**Quality of the services**

We will, (and we will use our reasonable endeavours to ensure that your service provider will), use reasonable skill and care in providing the services to you. We do not make any commitment to you that the content of the services will meet any specific requirements that you have (except to the extent that your requirements match the course description which is given in more detail on the Website).

You will be responsible for all activities that occur under your user name and password. You must not allow anyone else to use your user name and password. You must tell us immediately of any unauthorised use of your user name or password or if you believe that your user name or password are no longer confidential. We reserve the right to require you to alter your user name and password if we believe that they are no longer secure. We will never email you or ask you on the phone for your password.

We will provide you with access to your course once you have enrolled. You will need to log on using your user name and password to use the course.

When you first enrol for a learndirect course you will also be issued with a learner reference number. We may use this number in correspondence with you.

**Course fee and funding from the Skills Funding Agency**

You may be eligible to have part or the whole cost of the course paid for you by the SFA. If so, you must provide your Service Provider with the evidence we request. If you are not eligible for funding support, you will have to pay the whole cost of the course.

You may be asked to pay a course fee even if you are eligible for some funding from the Skills Funding Agency. Your advisor has explained any cost to you before you are asked to sign the Learning Agreement. The Learning Agreement shows the course fee payable by you, and you must pay that fee to us through your service provider.

**Provision of the Services**

**Help:**    You will find help with your learning in several ways. There are videos, ‘how to’ guides and frequently asked questions (FAQs) on the Website. You can send a message or speak to your advisor or tutor.

**Tutor Support** :  When you enrol on your course your service provider will assign a tutor to support to you through the course. Your tutor will contact you regularly to discuss your progress. You must keep in touch with your tutor at least every 3 weeks if you are going to continue on the course.

Your tutor will help you with any questions about your course. This includes how to use the course online, specialist advice about things you are learning in your course, or any other aspect of learning with learndirect. Your tutor may not be the same person every time you are learning. The tutor you speak to will know what course you are doing and will be able to see in the Website how you have progressed so far.

Tutor support will be provided on a first-come first-served basis. Tutor support at the learning centre will be available during the normal opening hours of the centre, as advertised on the learning centre entry in this Website.

**Computer compatibility on your own machine** : You can log onto the Website from any computer using your assigned user name and password. The computers in your learning centre have been tested to make sure they work with our courses.

However, not all computers have all the software needed to use every course learndirect provides, so we do not make any commitment that the course software will be compatible with or operate with the software or hardware on your own computer. If your computer does not have the necessary software installed you will be able to download the software from the Website (at your cost and risk) that should allow you to use the course. If it cannot, and you want to learn from home, your service provider will help you to choose another suitable course, or refund any course fee you have paid.

If we recommend that you either enable cookies or download certain publicly accessible software to ensure that your computer is capable of accessing the course, you do so at your own risk. There is a ‘How to’ guide called ‘Setting up my Computer for Learning’ on the Website. We use cookies to check the compatibility of your system with some of our services. If you wish to know more about cookies, please see the section on ‘Cookies’ in the [learndirect Use of Cookies Statement](http://www.learndirect.com/help/legal-information/how-we-use-cookies/).

If when you are doing your course you need to use software which is not provided as part of the course, or as a free download from the Website, you will be responsible for any charges from the software supplier.

**Technical Support:  **Your Service Provider will provide basic technical support to learners to help them to use our courses. Your Service Provider cannot provide technical help that is not about using your learndirectcourse. Please contact an advisor at your learning centre for technical help using the learndirect courses. There is a FAQ and a ‘How to’ guide and a contact form on the Website. We will use reasonable skill and care in providing any technical support and to ensure that this service is available to you. l **earndirect**  cannot guarantee uninterrupted availability of its technical support. We do not guarantee that the technical advice provided by us will resolve your technical problems.   If you decide to take advantage of such technical advice you must strictly follow that advice.

**Your right to cancel the course**

If you decide that you wish to cancel your enrolment, you may do so provided that you tell your service provider that you wish to cancel within 30 days of your enrolment. If you are entitled to a refund of any course fee, this will be paid to you within 30 days of the date of your cancellation.

You agree that you will lose your above right to cancel the course and get a refund of any course fee you have paid if you have started using the course. This will not affect your statutory rights.

**Our rights to stop providing the services to you**

We will make the course available to you in the Website from enrolment until:

**Complaints**

If you are not satisfied with any aspect of the services, please speak to your tutor or advisor, or contact us in the manner described in ‘Contact us’ section in the learning planner.

We will not be liable if we cannot provide the services to you because of an event beyond our reasonable control. Such events include (but are not limited to) events such as fire, flood, storm, strikes or other industrial action, failure of telecommunications services, war, riot, or the actions of any government or public body, failure or insolvency of the learning centre. If we are prevented from providing the services by such an event, we will take all reasonable steps to try to reinstate the provision of the services to you as soon as is reasonably practicable.

In no event will we be liable for any loss of profit, loss of earnings, loss of anticipated savings, loss of revenue or loss of goodwill that you may suffer. In no event will we be liable to you for any indirect or consequential loss that you may suffer.

If the correct price is lower than advertised, we will refund the balance of the Course Fee to you.

**Other Changes**

You may incur additional charges to your Internet Service Provider while you are accessing and / or downloading the Course Materials. Additional charges may also be payable to third parties for use of the software necessary to access and / or download the Course Materials. You are responsible for paying these charges.

**Provision of Access**

(a) If you have purchased online via the learndirect website

We will provide you with access to online Course Materials after we have confirmed your order by email. This will immediately follow a successful online transaction.

The online purchase process prompts you to specify whether you are:  
a) buying for yourself or  
b) buying for others.

Where you have specified that you are buying for yourself, in order to access Course Materials, you will be able to access the Course Materials by logging on the website using your registration details. The Course Materials can be accessed by you through the “my courses” page of the Website.

Where you have specified that you are buying for your business, or if you have purchased multiple copies of the same Course, the website will generate a series of “Enrolment Keys”. An Enrolment Key is a string of numbers and letters which will allow an individual to access the relevant Course Materials through the website after registration. Each Enrolment Key can be used by one person to access a specific Course. You may supply Enrolment Keys that we provide to you to individuals within your organisation (“Enrolment Key Holders”) for the purpose of providing them with access to the Course Materials. Unless otherwise stated, enrolment keys must be activated within 6 months and will provide access to the course for the duration stated on the course description. We cannot extend or replace expired enrolment keys.

**(b) If you have purchased by placing an order to be paid by invoice**

We will provide you with access to online Course Materials after we have confirmed your order by email. This will immediately follow a successful online transaction. Depending on your purchase and delivery requirements, we will fulfil your order in one of a number of ways.

These may include:  
“Enrolment Keys”. An Enrolment Key is a string of numbers and letters which will allow an individual to access the relevant Course Materials through the Website after registration. Each Enrolment Key can be used by one person to access a specific Course. You may supply Enrolment Keys that we provide to you to individuals within your organisation (“Enrolment Key Holders”) for the purpose of providing them with access to the Course Materials. Unless otherwise stated, enrolment keys must be activated within 6 months and will provide access to the course for the duration stated on the course description (typically 3 or 6 months). We cannot extend or replace expired Enrolment Keys.

“Learner Management System” (LMS).” A LMS is an online system that can be used to facilitate and track course enrolments. Depending on your purchase, the access model may include:

“Specific Course Enrolments” If you have purchased a number of enrolments (an enrolment provides access to a single course for one individual learner) from a specific course range, these will be added to your LMS account for you to administer (by registering your learners and providing access to the courses). In this case the enrolments must be accessed by the individuals within 12 months and (once the enrolment has been activated) will provide access to the course for the duration stated on the course description (typically 3 or 6 months). We cannot extend or replace expired enrolments.

“Pre-payment”. If you require the flexibility to select courses from across the range of products on the LMS, then you may make a pre-payment for unspecified course enrolments which will be added as a “starting balance” onto the LMS. The cost of each individual course (as shown on the LMS) is deducted from the pre-paid balance when a learner is enrolled onto that course. Your pre-payment must be used within 12 months and cannot be extended or refunded (meaning that you must “spend” your pre-payment by enrolling learners within the system to the value of the pre-payment).

  1. **c) If you purchased online Course Materials from one of our Resellers, you will be given access to the materials by the Reseller.**



Please note that it is your responsibility to check that the computer you plan to use to access your Course Materials is compatible with the minimum specification requirement that relates to the Materials you are ordering. The minimum specification for each course is provided on the Website.  
You accept that you will not have a claim for breach of contract (either against learndirect or an Agent or Reseller of learndirect) or otherwise in respect of any period of downtime/ unavailability of the website in circumstances similar to those outlined in Part A paragraph 1 of these Terms (dealing with the accessibility of the Website
