				<h3>LeagueRepublic and GDPR</h3>
				<p>
					Please also see the LeagueRepublic <a href="/terms.html"> Terms and Conditions</a>. Our terms and conditions require all leagues and clubs who use LeagueRepublic within the EU to be GDPR compliant.  
					Leagues are responsible for managing the "individual rights" of the individuals they are keeping data for in their leagues.	
				</p>
				
				<p>User's are not permitted to have a LeagueRepublic account (login / sign-in) unless they are 16 years old or over.</p>
				
				<h4>LeagueRepublic holds the following data on an individual with a LeagueRepublic account:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Name</li>
					<li>Email address</li>  
					<li>Encrypted login credentials</li>
					<li>Support questions history</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h5>This information is held by LeagueRepublic as the "Controller" for the purposes of:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Allowing the user to sign into the LeagueRepublic system</li>
					<li>Provide the user with a platform for customer chat and support</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h5>This data is passed to the following external systems:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://www.intercom.com/">Intercom</a> platform for customer support, <a href="https://www.intercom.com/terms-and-policies#privacy">Intercom privacy</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> to manage online payments, <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">Stripe privacy</a></li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>We do not pass this information to anyone else for marketing or any other purposes, so there is not an opt-in for any additional options.</p>
			
				<h4>LeagueRepublic holds data on league members on behalf of leagues</h4>
				<p>
					As a "Processor" LeagueRepublic holds personal data of league members who do not have a LeagueRepublic account, on behalf of leagues. 
					For example, a League Administrator could create a "Player" in the system who won't have a LeagueRepublic account and therefore won't be able to sign-in to the LeagueRepublic system.
				</p>
				
				<h5>The following personal data of league members without LeagueRepublic accounts:</h5>
				<ul class="pause">
					<li>Email address</li>
					<li>Mobile phone number</li>
				</ul>
				<p>can be used by the LeagueRepublic to provide email notifications (after an opt-in) and result entry SMS message prompts. It will not be used for marketing purposes.</p>
				
				<h5>LeagueRepublic will not use the following personal data of league members collected by leagues for any purpose:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Date Of Birth</li>
					<li>League reference numbers</li>
					<li>Address</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>Leagues and clubs are "Controllers" for the purposes of GDPR</h3>
				<p>
					A league may use many systems to manage their sports league and personal details about their members can cross many systems, some of which may be paper or spreadsheet based. For the purposes of GDPR a league is a "Controller" of this information and if it resides in the LeagueRepublic system then LeagueRepublic is a "Processor" of this information.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Leagues use LeagueRepublic to manage their day to day activities including:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Scheduling</li>
					<li>Results management</li>
					<li>Statistics management</li>
					<li>People management for administrators, referees and players</li> 
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Minimum personal data held within LeagueRepublic about league members in the league:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Name</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>And optionally:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Email address</li>
					<li>Date Of Birth</li>
					<li>League reference numbers</li>
					<li>Telephone contact details</li>
					<li>Address</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>LeagueRepublic provides leagues with the following tools</h3>
				<h4>Display the league's own privacy policy</h4>
				<p>You can upload your own privacy policy under 'Site Builder &gt; Documents'. In here you can state how and what personal data you collect and how you store, what you do with it, i.e. your purpose and which third parties you share the data with.</p> 
				
				<h4>Leagues must comply with the GDPR "Individual Rights"</h4>
				
				<h5>Right to be informed</h5>
				<p class="pause">This can be implemented in the league's privacy policy.</p>
				<p>If the league uses the LeagueRepublic Player Registration system then consent can be obtained by requiring league members to accept the league's terms / privacy policy when registering for the league.</p>
				
				<h5>Right of access</h5>
				<p>Individuals have a right to access their personal data. LeagueRepublic provide a web page detailing personal information and related league sports data about an individual which a league can give to that individual.</p>
				
				<h5>Right to rectification</h5>
				<p>All data relating to an individual can be corrected by any League Administrator within a league.</p>
				
				<h5>Right to erasure</h5>
				<p>We provide the tools to completely erase a person in your league. There is no way to revert this. All personal data will be deleted and the player or person will have a first name and last name anonymised.</p>
				
				<h5>Right to restrict process</h5>
				<p>We provide the tools to restrict the processing of an individual. Their personal details will not be viewable within the administration system or the public sites and their first name and last name are anonymised.</p>
			
				<h3>Where we store your personal data</h3>
				<p>All LeagueRepublic data is stored using "<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS)", they are a subsidiary of Amazon.com that provides a cloud computing platform for LeagueRepublic. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/">AWS Privacy</a></p>
