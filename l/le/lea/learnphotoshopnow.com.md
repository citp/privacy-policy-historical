Children’s Privacy

**

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have personal information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our systems. LearnPhotoshopNow.com encourages parents to go online with their kids. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer:

* Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult. Includes name, address, phone, school, etc. 
* Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate. 
* Look for Web site privacy policies. Know how your child's information is treated.
