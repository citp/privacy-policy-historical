##  INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Personal Business Information. When you register for certain services on the Sites, we will ask you to provide personal and business information. For some services we collect personal and business information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. We may also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, and preferences. Information we collect may be combined with information we obtained through other services we offer. We may collect information about your visit to the Sites, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with the Sites and services. We may also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every web site you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses.

Aggregate Information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual user identities have been removed. We collect aggregate information about you and your use of our services and combine it with information about how others use the same service. Such aggregate information includes, without limitation, site traffic, page views, and impressions. This information may be correlated to you for our internal use only. However, we may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all aggregate information (i.e., information that does not personally identify you).

##  DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL AND BUSINESS INFORMATION

Except as set forth in this privacy statement, we do not disclose, sell, rent, loan, trade or lease any personally identifying information collected at our Sites to any third party. We will disclose personal information in the following circumstances:

##  LINKS

Please be aware that we may provide links to third party Web sites from our Sites as a service to our users and we are not responsible for the content or information collection practices of those sites. We have no ability to control the privacy and data collection practices of such sites and the privacy policies of such sites may differ from that of LeapFish. Therefore, we encourage you to review and understand the privacy policies of such sites before providing them with any information.

##  COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS

We may use cookies to identify users and customize their experience on our site based on information they give us. Cookies are small pieces of information or files that are stored on a user's computer by the Web server through a user's browser for record keeping purposes. A cookie itself is not designed or intended to read any information from your computer (other than the contents of the cookie); rather, it is an identifier used by the Web site that originally placed it on your hard drive. The actual contents of the cookie information can be retrieved by the same site's Web server in order to personalize, monitor, or regulate the use of the site. We do not use Web beacons, or similar technology on our Sites. However, we permit third parties to place Web beacons on our Sites to monitor the effectiveness of advertising and for other lawful purposes. A Web beacon, also known as a "Web bug," is a small, graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document or in an e-mail message that is designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a site. Web beacons collect non-personally identifying information such as the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from and the time it was viewed. We do not use (or permit third parties to use) Web beacons to collect personally identifying information about you.

##  SECURITY

We use strict security measures to store and maintain personally identifying information to protect it from loss, misuse, alternation or destruction by any unauthorized party while it is under our control.

##  QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of our Sites, or your dealings with our Sites, please contact us at anytime.
