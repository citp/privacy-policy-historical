**Circles, Chapters/Networks and Co-Sponsors:**

A Circle is a small group that meets regularly to learn and grow together. As described in our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms/), a Chapter/Network is a group of Circles that share information, network and/or host events together. You must be a registered user of our Services to access our materials and start, message or join a Circle or Chapter/Network. When you participate in a Circle, Circle Leaders can see you listed as a member of the Circle (your “Member Listing”). Your Member Listing includes your name, geographic location (if provided) and email address. If you or your Circle joins a Chapter, the leaders of that Chapter can see your Member Listing and your email address. If you’re the leader of a Chapter/Network, members and users can see your name, geographic location (if provided), and profile picture. If you send an e-mail to a Circle, Chapter or Circle Leader, your e-mail address is visible to recipients of that e-mail. Some Circles and Chapters may be cosponsored by a Third-Party Service with a particular interest in the mission of that Circle or Chapter. These Co-sponsors have access to the Member Listings and email addresses of the members of the Circles and Chapters they sponsor. If you provide information directly to a Co-sponsor, that information will be subject to the privacy policy of that Co-sponsor, and the use of that information by the Co-sponsor will not be governed by this Privacy Policy.

**Your Choices:**

You can visit our Services without providing any Personal Information. If you choose not to provide any Personal Information, you may not be able to use certain Services.

You may disable our ability to use cookies by using the cookie controls in your web browser. For more information on how to do this, please visit: [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). However, if you do disable all cookies, we will not be able to provide you with some features of our Services.

If we send you marketing e-mails about services that may interest you, each e-mail will contain instructions permitting you to “opt-out” of receiving future marketing or other communications.

**Children’s Information:**

LeanIn.Org does not knowingly collect or store Personal Information about children under the age of 13. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to instruct their children not to provide Personal Information on the Internet without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to LeanIn.Org through our Services, please contact us and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

**International Users:**

LeanIn.Org is based in the United States, and, regardless of where you use our Services, the information collected as part of that use will be transferred to and maintained on servers located in the United States. Please note that any information we obtain about you will be stored in accordance with U.S. privacy laws, regulations, and standards, which may not be equivalent to the laws in your country of residence. By using our Services, you consent to this collection, transfer, storage, and processing of information to and in the United States.

**Third-Party Functionality and Links to Third-Party Sites:**

Some of the functionality on our Services may be provided by third parties that are not affiliated with LeanIn.Org. These entities may collect or receive certain information about your use of our Services, including through the use of cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies. LeanIn.Org is not responsible for the privacy practices of these entities. In addition, our Services may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by LeanIn.Org. These links do not imply that LeanIn.Org endorses or has reviewed the third party websites. Any such websites are not under our control and we are not responsible for their privacy policies or practices. If you provide any Personal Information through any such third-party website, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of such third-party.

**Integration with Social Networking and Other Services:**

Our Services may allow you to enable or log in via various online services, including social networking services like Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr. Our Services also may enable you to access these Third-Party Services directly or indirectly through our Services. By directly integrating these Third-Party Services, we aim to make your online experiences richer and more personalized. When you add a Third-Party Service account to our Services or log into our Services using your Third-Party Service account, we may collect relevant information necessary to enable our Services to access that Third-Party Service and your data contained within that Third-Party Service. We also may share your information with the operator of that Third-Party Service to facilitate or enhance delivery of that Third-Party Service or other services to you.

As part of an integration with a Third-Party Service, that Third-Party Service may provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to the Third-Party Service, and we will use, store, and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For example, if we administer a group using a Third-Party Service, we may receive any information that Third-Party Service may make available to group administrators. However, please remember that the manner in which Third-Party Services use, store, and disclose your information is governed by the policies of such third-parties, and LeanIn.Org is not responsible for the privacy practices or other actions of any Third-Party Services that may be enabled within our Services.

You may also have the option of posting your activities on our Services and other content to Third-Party Services when you access content through our Services. For example, you may post to Facebook that you performed an activity on our Services. We also may publish user-generated contributions through Third-Party Services, such as by posting a user story on our Facebook Page or asking you to enable publishing your Instagram profile or feed on our Sites (including as part of your profile on our Sites) or Facebook Page. If either you or we choose to make any of your contributions available through a Third-Party Service or engage in other activities in connection with a Third-Party Service, your friends, followers, and subscribers on those Third-Party Services that you have enabled will be able to view those contributions and activities.

**Security:**

LeanIn.Org takes steps to protect the information provided via our Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error-free. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Information or other information to LeanIn.Org via e-mail or the Internet.
