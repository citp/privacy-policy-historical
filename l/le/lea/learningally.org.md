Learning Ally Member Privacy Policy has been developed as an extension of our commitment to combine the finest quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with our Members.

Learning Ally may, from time to time, modify this Member Privacy Policy to reflect legal, technological and other developments. 

Please note that Privacy Notices advising Members and Prospects as to the specific uses that are being made of their Personally-Identifiable Information by specific Business Units within Learning Ally may also be modified from time to time to reflect changes in business practices.

Learning Ally will also comply with applicable U.S. laws that impose additional responsibilities on Learning Ally beyond those stated in this Policy in connection with the treatment of Personally Identifiable Information about its Members and Prospects.

Personally Identifiable Information includes, for example, e-mail addresses, billing information, employment status and data that tracks user activity on a Web site or online services. A subset of that category, Sensitive Data, deserves additional safeguards. Sensitive Data includes, by way of example, Social Security numbers, personal financial data (such as credit card information) and information about specific medical conditions.
