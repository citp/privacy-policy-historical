The Policy extends to and covers all operations and functions of LTTTM.

At LTTTM, we are committed to ensuring the confidentiality and security of the personal information supplied by individuals. LTTTM is bound by the National Privacy Principles (‘NPPs’) contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (‘Privacy Act’). LTTTM has appointed a Privacy Officer, who oversees the Privacy Policy, and ensures that LTTTM’s management of personal information is in accordance with this Policy and with the Privacy Act.

LTTTM ‘s Privacy Policy Statement will be reviewed from time to time to take account of new laws and technology, changes to our operations and practices and to make sure it remains appropriate to the changing environment.

Some personal information, which we collect, is “sensitive information”. “Sensitive information” includes information relating to a person’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion, trade union or other professional or trade association membership, sexual preferences and criminal record, which is also personal information, and also includes health information about an individual.

Typically, the type of personal information we collect about the individual includes his or her name, age, date of birth, occupation, mailing address, phone numbers, email address and other information that is relevant to the products and services we provide.

The personal information may also include information about the form of identification used in relation to an individual to send or receive a transaction (required by law in some instances), and information about a transaction in relation to an individual, including details of the amounts paid in or out of an individual’s account as well as delivery instructions.
