**Privacy Policies**

[**Our EU GDPR Privacy Policy  Is Available Here.**](https://www.learntotradethemarket.com/privacy/privacy-policy-europe-gdpr)

[**Our Cookie Policy & EU GDPR Cookie Policy Is Here.**](https://www.learntotradethemarket.com/privacy/cookie-policy)

**Global Privacy Policy For Clients, Free Subscribers & Website Visitors**

This Policy applies to Learn to trade the Market Pty Ltd (ABN: 68 137 007 062 ) and any holding companies, other subsidiaries or related entities of Learn To Trade The Market, all of which are referred to as ” LTTTM”, “we”, “our”, or “us”. The Policy extends to and covers all operations and functions of LTTTM.

At LTTTM, we are committed to ensuring the confidentiality and security of the personal information supplied by individuals. LTTTM is bound by the Australian Privacy Principles (‘APPs’) contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (‘Privacy Act’). LTTTM has appointed a Privacy Officer, who oversees the Privacy Policy, and ensures that LTTTM’s management of personal information is in accordance with this Policy and with the Privacy Act.

LTTTM ‘s Privacy Policy Statement will be reviewed from time to time to take account of new laws and technology, changes to our operations and practices and to make sure it remains appropriate to the changing environment.

The word “individual” refers to a customer, client, trustee or any other person with whom we come into contact. All contractors, sub-contractors, vendors, service providers, customers, agents or any other third parties that have access to and/or utilise personal information collected and/or held by LTTTM must abide by this Privacy Policy.

“Personal information” is information or an opinion relating to an individual, which can be used to identify that individual. Some personal information, which we collect, is “sensitive information”. “Sensitive information” includes information relating to a person’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion, trade union or other professional or trade association membership, sexual preferences and criminal record, which is also personal information, and also includes health information about an individual.

1\. How we collect personal information

As the provider of financial services, including trading education, we may collect sensitive information about an individual’s personal circumstances and financial details, which may potentially identify the individual and/or contains an opinion about the individual.

Our ability to provide individuals with our products and services is sometimes dependent on us obtaining certain personal information about the individual. Typically, the type of personal information we collect about the individual includes his or her name, age, date of birth, occupation, mailing address, phone numbers, email address and other information that is relevant to the products and services we provide.

The personal information may also include information about the form of identification used in relation to an individual to send or receive a transaction (required by law in some instances), and information about a transaction in relation to an individual, including details of the amounts paid in or out of an individual’s account as well as delivery instructions.

We generally collect personal and/or sensitive information from individuals by the following methods:  
1.1 directly from applications, questionnaires and/or forms completed by individuals (via our websites), which include surveys or special offers, when individuals wish to use our services, purchase our products or apply for a position in our organisation;  
1.2 from information disclosed to us by an individual on the phone, or by sending us correspondence (by letter, fax or email) or contact us in person; and  
1.3 from a variety of third party sources, including our business contacts credit reference and credit checking agencies, and financial institutions.

The above list is not exhaustive.

In some circumstances we may be provided with personal information about an individual from somebody else, for example a referral from another person. We will take reasonable steps to inform the individual that it holds the personal information and the purpose for which it holds the personal information.

The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) and Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Rules Instrument 2007 (No. 1) require us to collect certain identification information about you. We will collect personal information from third parties in respect of AML/CTF checks which are required to be carried out, under AML/CTF Legislation.

We must not collect sensitive information unless the individual has consented, or it is required by law, or in other special specified circumstances.

Having provided consent, you are able to withdraw it at any time. To withdraw consent, please contact our office. Please note that withdrawing your consent may lead to us no longer being able to provide you with the product or service you enjoy given that, as mentioned above, it is impracticable for us to treat some customers differently.

If the personal information we request is not provided, we may not be able to provide individuals with the benefit of our services, or meet an individual’s needs appropriately.

2\. Incomplete of Inaccurate Information

We may not be able to provide you with the products or services you are seeking if you provide incomplete or inaccurate information.

3\. Why do we collect personal information?  
We collect personal information for the following purposes:  
* to conduct our business of providing our products and services to our clients;  
* to enter into contracts with sub-contractors to conduct our business;  
* to assess applications by individuals to provide them with our products and services;  
* complying with our legal obligations  
* to comply with our legal obligations; and  
* to help us manage and enhance our services.  
We may also obtain information from time to time through market research, to enable us to improve our services or to consider the wider needs of our customers or potential customers.

4\. Information we may collect

The personal and sensitive information we collect generally consists of name, address, date of birth, gender, marital status, occupation, account details, contact details (including telephone, facsimile and e-mail) and financial information.

We are required by law to identify you if you are opening a new account or adding a new signatory to an existing account. Anti-money laundering laws require us to sight and record details of certain documents (i.e. photographic and non photographic documents) in order to meet the standards set under those laws.

We may take steps to verify the information we collect; for example, a birth certificate provided as identification may be verified with records held by the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages to protect against impersonation.

5\. About whom do we collect personal information?  
The type of information we may collect and hold includes (but is not limited to) personal information about:  
* individuals;  
* third parties;  
* prospective employees; and  
* other people with whom we come into contact.

6\. Dealing with unsolicited personal information

If we receive personal information that is not solicited by us, we will only retain it, if we determine that it is reasonably necessary for one or more of our functions or activities and that you have consented to the information being collected or given the absence of your consent that it was impracticable or unreasonable for us to obtain it under the circumstances.

If these conditions are not met, we will destroy or de-identify the information.

If such unsolicited information is sensitive information we will obtain your consent to retain it regardless of what the circumstances are.

7\. How might we use and disclose personal information?  
When we refer to “use “of personal information, we mean use within our organisation for the purposes outlined above. When we use the word “disclose” we mean providing the information to persons outside of our organisation.

We may use and disclose personal information for the primary purposes for which it is collected, and also for reasonably expected secondary purposes which are related to the primary purpose and in other circumstances authorised by the Privacy Act. Sensitive information will be used and disclosed only for the purpose for which it was provided or a directly related secondary purpose, unless the individual agrees otherwise, or where certain other limited circumstances apply (e.g., where required by law).

We may use and disclose personal information for the following purposes:  
* to conduct our business of providing our products and services to clients;  
* to register and handle product warranties, and product warranty claims;  
* to enter into contracts with sub-contractors to conduct our business;  
* to assess applications by individuals to provide them with our services;  
* to communicate with individuals, by providing them from time to time with information contained in  
newsletters, emails or brochures;  
* to comply with our legal obligations; and  
* to help us manage and enhance our services.  
When you enter provide your contact details as part of a survey or market research questionnaire, we may ask for your name, address, and e-mail address so we can conduct the survey and thereby enhance our services. We may ask for other information to enable us to improve our websites or to send you special offers. In these instances we will usually provide you with an opportunity to opt out from receiving any information after providing your details.

Unless a client agrees and consents, we do not disclose personal information we collect to others for the purpose of allowing them to direct market their products and services. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal or contact information for direct marketing purposes without the consent of clients or users.

We may engage other people to perform services for us, this may involve those people handling personal information that we possess. In these situations, we prohibit that person from using personal information about you except for the specific purpose for which we supply it.

We may disclose personal and/or sensitive information to:  
* third parties, including (but not limited to) any entities or organisations handling any claims;  
* consultants we engage to assist individuals;  
* consultants we engage to manage our business;  
* third party service providers;  
* organisations involved in a transfer or sale of all or part of our assets or business (including accounts and  
trade receivables);  
* our lawyers;  
* our accountants;  
* our compliance consultants;  
* regulatory authorities, including the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC); and  
* anyone else to whom the individual authorises us to disclose it.

We may also collect personal and/or sensitive information from these organisations and individuals, and deal with that information in accordance with this Policy.

LTTTM trains its employees and advisers who handle personal information to respect the confidentiality of customer information and the privacy of individuals. LTTTM regards breaches of your privacy very seriously and will impose appropriate penalties for breach of this Policy, which may, in certain circumstances, include dismissal.
