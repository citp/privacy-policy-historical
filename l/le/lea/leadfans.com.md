Leadfans may also collect information about how Users use our Web site, for example, by tracking the number of unique views received by the pages of the Web site or the domains from which Users originate. We may use “cookies” to track how Users use our Web site. A cookie is a piece of software that a Web server can store on the Users’ PC and use to identify the User should they visit the Web site again.

After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financial’s, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.
