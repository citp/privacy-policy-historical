Privacy Statement<br>
<br>
LeadRush is committed to safeguarding the personal information of visitors to this website and users of LeadRush’s products.  The following privacy policy is designed to help you understand how we collect, use, and protect the personal information you may choose to provide when using this website or our products.<br>
<br>
Your Consent<br>
<br>
By visiting and using the features of this website you accept and agree to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy, in particular the collection and use of your personal information as described here.<br>
<br>
What Information Does LeadRush Collect?<br>
<br>
When using this website, you may provide LeadRush with two types of information: 1) personal information you knowingly disclose that is collected on an individual basis, and 2) website use information that automatically collected while you browse this website.<br>
<br>
1. Personal Information You Choose To Disclose <br>
<br>
You may be asked to provide certain personal information when taking advantage of the services and products that LeadRush offers.  When registering for webinars, online training sessions, or other informational products, you will provide us with information, including your email address.  If you choose to purchase a product or service, we will need to collect personal information from you as part of the transaction, including your name, mailing address, email address, credit card number, billing address, and a telephone number.  If you choose to communicate with us through email, we may retain the content of your email message and your email address, along with our response.  If you choose to participate in any surveys or contests that may be featured on the website from time to time, we may retain any personal information you provide, such contact information (name, shipping address) or demographic information (zip code, age level).<br>
<br>
At any time, you may choose not to provide any of the above information, but by doing so you may be unable to access features of this website, including the products and services we offer.<br>
<br>
This website also features a forum page where registered users may post comments and communicate with other users.  LeadRush will make efforts to remove a comment containing personal information if requested to do so, but will not be responsible for public disclosure of any personal information posted in the forum section.<br>
<br>
2. Information That Is Automatically Collected<br>
<br>
Like most websites, this website automatically collects certain web use information through server log files and “cookies.”  Our web server logs record basic information such as your IP address, the date and time you visited, the pages you viewed, the time you spent on the website, and the pages you visited before and after our website.  “Cookies” are a form of internet software that transfers data to your computer .  Cookies can be used to track your visit on our website and to provide specialized content for individual users.  Most web browsers will allow you to notify you when you receive a cookie or to deny cookie access to your computer.  Please note that if you choose to deny cookie access, some features of this website may be inaccessible, or may not function as effectively. <br>
<br>
How Does LeadRush Use the Information It Collects?<br>
<br>
Generally speaking, we use the information we collect to administer our business activities, provide you the products and services you request, process payments, monitor how our website and services are used, tailor and deliver our marketing and promotional efforts, improve and individualize our services, communicate with users regarding our terms of service and privacy policy, and troubleshoot issues.  <br>
<br>
From time to time, we may share aggregated information (which does not identify you individually) with advertisers or other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes.<br>
<br>
From time to time, we may also use personal information to contact you regarding new products and services, special promotions, or changes to our website.  If you do not wish to receive this information, you may notify us using the link provided in the communication, and we will not send you any further notices.<br>
<br>
We do not share, sell, lend, or lease any of the individually identifiable personal information we receive from users, except to the extent necessary to process transactions that users have requested.  We may, however, disclose information when required to do so by law, or when we have reason to believe disclosure is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service, or to protect our users and the public.<br>
<br>
