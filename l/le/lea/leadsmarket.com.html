                    What Information We Collect and How We Use It<br>
                    <br>
                    Personally Identifiable Information<br>
                    <br>

                    (ii) your communications with LeadsMarket.com and/or the Websites; and (iii) information
                    from third parties as set forth in the "Supplementation of Information" Section
                    below. The personally identifiable information that we collected may include, but
                    is not limited to: (i) full name; (ii) complete mailing address; (iii) e-mail address;
                    (iv) daytime, evening and mobile telephone numbers; (v) date of birth; (vi) gender;

                    ID verification information, such as credit card number; and (xiv) such other information
                    that we may request from time to time. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, the
                    information described in (x) through (xiii) above, and any other financial information
                    requested of you, shall be considered "Sensitive Information." We collect this personal
                    information only from those individuals/entities that choose to participate.<br>
                    <br>
                    We use this information to process requests for products and services. We also use
                    collected information to communicate with you, such as to notify you (through e-mails
                    and newsletters) about updates to products, to send you order confirmations and/or
                    to provide you with important product warranty or safety information.<br>
                    <br>
                    In addition, we use the personal information that you provide, other than your Sensitive
                    Information, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you,
                    by means of e-mail or through our newsletter, additional products, programs or services
                    that we believe may be of interest to you.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Supplementation of Information
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect online with outside
                    records (e.g., information from our affiliates, subsidiaries and third party partners
                    (collectively, "Strategic Partners") or from wireless providers) to enhance our
                    ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities
                    to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.<br>
                    <br>
                    Sharing of Your Information<br>
                    <br>
                    Agents and contractors who have access to personally identifiable information are
                    required to protect it in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by,
                    for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the
                    services they are performing for LeadsMarket.com.<br>
                    <br>
                    In addition, if you access the Website(s) through third-party website(s), such as
                    one of our Strategic Partners' websites, we also may need to report certain personally
                    identifiable information (e.g., name and e-mail address) back to that referring
                    website(s). As we explain in the following Section, we will tell you at the point
                    of collection if we will share personally identifiable information with the Strategic
                    Partner through which you access the Website(s).<br>
                    <br>
                    In addition, we will share aggregated demographic information with our Strategic
                    Partners. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.<br>
                    <br>
                    We will never disclose any credit card information to any third-party marketers
                    or other non-governmental entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may: (a) share
                    the fact that we have credit card information on file for specific users of the
                    Website(s) but we will not share your specific credit card information with such
                    third parties without your prior informed consent; (b) share your credit card information
                    with consumer credit agencies; and (c) disclose your credit card information to
                    third party processors for the sole purpose of effectuating transactions that you
                    enter into at the Website(s). We may also disclose your personally identifiable
                    and/or Sensitive Information: (i) to a governmental entity if so ordered by a court
                    of law, to comply with the local, state and federal laws (ii) where otherwise required
                    by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform
                    to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on our Website(s);
                    or (iii) if we are sold or acquired.<br>
                    <br>
                    Our Collection of Personally Identifiable Information Through a Third-party Website<br>
                    <br>
                    To provide you with content and service, we have relationships with many of the
                    best service and content companies. As a result of these relationships, you can
                    access the Website(s) through third-party websites. You can recognize most of the
                    LeadsMarket.com pages on these third-party websites by looking for the joint branding
                    of LeadsMarket.com and a third-party company. For example, if you see a logo on
                    the page that says "Powered by LeadsMarket.com" you are most likely on
                    a co-branded page.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Whenever you provide registration information on a co-branded page, that data may
                    be shared with the third-party website through which you access the Website(s).
                    If personally identifiable information may be provided to such a third party, we
                    will inform you at the point of collection and provide you with an opportunity to
                    tell us not to share your personally identifiable information. We encourage you
                    to read the privacy policies of such third parties, as this Privacy Policy does
                    not cover their use of information.

                    Non-Personally Identifiable Information<br>
                    <br>
                    We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about our visitors
                    when you visit many of our Website pages, such as the type of browser you are using
                    (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using,
                    (e.g., Windows '98 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider
                    (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the
                    design and content of our Website pages and to enable us to personalize your Internet
                    experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze Website
                    usage.<br>

                    Choices/Opt Out

                    <br>
                    If you prefer not to receive marketing information from us or wish to fully deactivate
                    your account information, simply let us know by sending a letter via certified mail
                    to 6130 Elton Avenue Suite # 386, Las Vegas, NV 89107<br>
                    To opt out from the newsletter, you can unsubscribe your email by visiting our <a href="unsubscribe.aspx" target="_blank">unsubscribe page</a>. or an e-mail to
                    Customer Relations. Please note that even if you chose to opt out of LeadsMarket.com’s
                    marketing, we will continue to send you important service-related communications
                    (e.g., order confirmation or product safety information). However, these communications
                    will not be promotional in nature.

                    To enhance your experience with the Website(s), we use "cookies." Cookies
                    are used by your computer's browser to store your preferences. We use both session
                    and persistent cookies. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address

                    We use cookies to understand Website usage and to improve the content and offerings

                    Web Beacons<br>
                    <br>
                    A web beacon is a programming code that can be used to display an image on a web
                    page, but can also be used to transfer your unique user identification to a database
                    and associate you with previously acquired information about an individual in a
                    database. This allows LeadsMarket.com to track certain websites that you visit.
                    Web beacons are used to track LeadsMarket.com behavioral habits for marketing purposes
                    to determine products or services that you may be interested in. In addition to
                    using web beacons on web pages, LeadsMarket.com also uses web beacons in email messages
                    sent to individuals listed in LeadsMarket.com’s database.

                    <br>
                    New Technology<br>
                    The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly
                    developing. As a result, LeadsMarket.com strongly encourages individuals to revisit
                    this Privacy Policy for any updates regarding its use of new technology.<br>
                    <br>
                    Links<br>
                    In addition, the Website(s) contain(s) links to other websites whose information
                    practices may be different than ours. Our Privacy Policy does not cover these third
                    parties' use of information. Visitors should consult the other companies' and websites'
                    privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or
                    collected by, these third parties.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    No Information Collected from Children<br>
                    We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and
                    to participate and monitor the interactive activities of their children. LeadsMarket.com
                    will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age
                    of eighteen (18). If LeadsMarket.com obtains actual knowledge that it has collected
                    personal information about a child under the age of eighteen (18), that information
                    will be immediately deleted from its database. Because it does not collect such
                    information, LeadsMarket.com has no such information to use or to disclose to third
                    parties. LeadsMarket.com has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children’s
                    Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").

                    <br>
                    Security<br>
                    All collected information is stored in a technically and physically secure environment.
                    When our registration/application process prompts users to enter Sensitive Information,
                    and when we store and transmit such Sensitive Information, that information is encrypted
                    and is protected with SSL encryption software. While we use SSL encryption to protect
                    Sensitive Information online, we also do everything in our power to protect other
                    user information both online and off-line. Unfortunately, no data transmission over
                    the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to
                    protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any
                    information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive
                    your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems.
                    All of our users’ information, not just Sensitive Information, is restricted in
                    our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are
                    granted access to personal information. Furthermore, access to this information
                    is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. Our employees are dedicated
                    to ensuring the security and privacy of all user information. Employees not adhering
                    to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action. Please note that any attempt
                    to breach the security of the network, our servers, databases or other hardware
                    or software supporting the Website(s) or other websites under the control of LeadsMarket.com
                    constitutes a crime punishable by law. We will turn over to authorities, any and
                    all evidence relating to a potential breach of security or other abuse against the
                    network, servers, databases or other such supporting equipment or software. In compliance
                    with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you in the event that we
                    learn of an information security breach with respect to your personal information.
                    You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised
                    that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine
                    the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.<br>
                    <br>
                    Reviewing Your Information<br>
                    If you would like to review and update or correct the personally identifiable information
                    that we have collected from you, or if no longer wish to continue your service with
                    us, simply send your request via certified mail to 6130 Elton Avenue Suite # 386,
