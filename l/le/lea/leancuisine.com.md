Thank you for visiting LeanCuisine.com, a NESTLE® USA Web site. NESTLE is committed to providing you an enriching and informative experience within a trusted and secure environment. This privacy policy tells you how NESTLE uses personal information collected at this site. Please read this privacy policy before using this Web site or submitting any personal information. By using this site, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy. We may, infrequently, change these practices, but any changes will be posted and changes will only apply to activities and information on a going forward, not retroactive basis. You are encouraged to review the privacy policy whenever you visit to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used. 

The privacy practices set forth in this Privacy Policy are for this Web site only. Other NESTLE Web sites may have different practices. If you link to other NESTLE sites, please review the privacy policies posted at those sites. 

What we collect and how we use it  
We will occasionally request information from visitors to provide them special offers and features. In these instances, we collect personally identifiable information, like names, postal addresses, email addresses, etc. It is only collected when voluntarily submitted by visitors and is only used to fulfill the specific offer or request. For example, to receive email updates or newsletters about the site, our products and promotions; to send you samples, if offered and requested; to enter a specific sweepstakes or other online promotion; or offer to respond to your question or issue in our contact or email section. This information is only used to fulfill your specific request, unless you give us permission to use it in another manner, for example, to receive future information from us. 

Your name, and/or screen name, and/or email address may also be requested and used to help set up a personalized and personal access site of our Web site. If you choose not to provide this information, personalized features will not be available to you. Once again, this information is only used for the feature requested, unless you have given us permission to use it in another manner. 

To make the registration process easier, we have created a "one time" registration tool that is used across many of NESTLE's Web sites. This means that if you have registered at one NESTLE site, the information you provided can be automatically made available to you for registering at another NESTLE site. Don't worry, all your information is password protected and you must still opt in to receiving information from a NESTLE site or a brand before you are added to its mailing list. 

If you have elected to receive future information from us, you may receive information by regular mail or email, depending on the information you provided. From time to time, we may feature products/services from other reputable organizations, companies or brands that may interest you. Your personally identifiable information is not shared with these other companies. All mailings come from NESTLE. 

We do not share personally identifiable information collected at this site with third parties, except for the limited instances noted below. The exceptions are: 

  * We may share your information with our partner agencies who assist us in administering the site and various programs and promotions. They can only use the information to administer our site and programs. These agencies are bound by agreement to keep your information private and secure.
  * From time to time we may run a joint promotion on this site with another company or organization. You will always be advised if another company is also collecting information. We recommend you review that company’s privacy policy, and we may provide a link to that company’s privacy policy.
  * Sometimes we run programs featuring another company’s service or products and you are given the opportunity to opt-in to future receipt of information from that company. We recommend you review that company’s privacy policy, and we may provide a link to that company’s privacy policy.
  * We may also disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or if in our good faith judgment, such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, to respond to any claims, or to protect the rights of NESTLE, its customers and the public.
  * In the event of an acquisition of all or part of Nestle by another company, or in the event that Nestle were to sell or dispose of all or a part of the Nestle business, the acquirer would have access to the information maintained by that Nestle business, which could include personal information, subject to applicable law. Similarly, information may be transferred as part of a reorganization or insolvency proceeding.



NESTLE may on occasion combine information we receive with outside records to enhance our consumer profiles for our own marketing purposes. 

Referrals and prospects  
If you send a friend an email from the site referring the friend to the site, the "referral" information you provide is used on a one-time basis to facilitate this communication and is not further retained by NESTLE. 

If you sign a friend up for a special program offered at this site, such as an offline magazine, your friend’s information will only be used for the purpose for which provided, and all our communications to your friend contain an opt out. 

Bulletin Boards  
When you voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, email address, etc.) on a bulletin board, message board, in a chat area, or other such publicly accessible areas, the information can be collected and used by other Web surfers. This may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties. Demographic information and surveys and polls  
We may ask for demographic or profile (age, gender, interests, etc.) information in a survey or at registration. This information is used to assist us in tailoring the site and our products to visitors and consumers. We may share aggregated demographic and survey information, as opposed to individual information, with third parties. Cookie/tracking technology  
This site uses cookie and tracking technology. Cookie and tracking technology is useful for gathering information such as browser type and operating system, tracking the number of visitors to the web site, and understanding how visitors use the site. Cookies can also help tailor the site to visitors' needs and help customize the site to visitors’ requests. For example, we may use cookies to make sure you don't see the same information repeatedly. Also, if you have elected to store a recipe/activity at the site or given us a date to track (due dates, anniversaries, etc. ) cookies help us do this. The site may also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and for other similar purposes. We use general IP address information to better understand how the site is utilized. 

Personal information cannot be collected via cookies and other tracking technology, however, if you previously provided personally identifiable information, cookies may be tied to such information. Aggregate (not individual), cookie and tracking information may be shared with third parties. 

Information security, opting-out, changing and accessing information  
Your personally identifiable information is kept secure. Only authorized NESTLE employees, agents and contractors (who have agreed to keep information secure and confidential) have access to this information and only to help NESTLE administer its promotional programs and the site.

You may also use this contact information if you have any questions about this policy or our practices. General
