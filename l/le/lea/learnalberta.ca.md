## 2\. Personal Information Management

Any personal information you do provide is managed according to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Alberta) (“FOIP Act”). This means that, at the point of collection, you will be informed that your personal information is being collected, the purpose for which it is being collected, and a contact person who can answer any questions you may have regarding the collection activity will be identified. We collect only what is necessary for the operation of the website and to respond to your needs. Our use and disclosure of your personal information is limited by the privacy protection provisions of the FOIP Act.
