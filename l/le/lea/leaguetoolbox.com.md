**More About Privacy & Protection of Information**

As part of an industry that deals with sensitive information, LeagueToolbox recognizes the importance of member privacy. Most efforts at legislating privacy begin with "Fair Information Practices", which are sets of privacy principles. Fair information practices are guidelines for the collection, use, disclosure, retention and disposal of personal information. These practices are the cornerstone of most efforts to protect personal information around the world. These guidelines have been widely adopted. Their influence can be seen in the laws that govern the public sector federally, as well as provincially in Canada. 

In the early 90's, the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) gathered representatives from the public, private sector industries, advocacy groups and unions, to discuss the need for a common code to protect personal information in the private sector. The outcome of the initiative was the development of the Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information, which represents a consensus among all stakeholders. Based on the OECD guidelines, the Code addresses the way in which organizations collect, use, disclose and protect personal information, and the right of individuals to access personal information about themselves and to have the information corrected if necessary. 

The Standards Council of Canada adopted the CSA Code as a National Standard in 1996, making Canada the first country in the world to adopt such a Standard. In May of 1996, the member policy group of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) passed a unanimous, 25-country resolution in favor of a proposal to develop an international standard on privacy based on the CSA Standard. 

More recently, the CSA Model Code has become a schedule to the Personal Information and Electronic Documents Act of Canada.
