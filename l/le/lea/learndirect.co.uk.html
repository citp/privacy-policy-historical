<li>Progress </li>
<li>Achievement/completion </li>
<li>Outcome/destination </li>
<li>Withdrawal </li></ul>
<h3><a id="jcp" name="jcp"></a>Job Centre Plus Referrals </h3>
<p>If we or our Service Providers receive your details via a Skills Conditionality Referral from Job Centre Plus we are obliged to keep them informed of your progress.&nbsp; We will complete a Starter/Leaver notification form that contains details of the course being taken, when started and an anticipated end date.&nbsp; You will be asked to sign this to confirm you have started the learning prior to it being sent to Job Centre Plus for processing. </p>
<p>When you stop learning for whatever reason the remaining boxes of the Starter/Leaver notification form are completed and returned to Job Centre Plus.&nbsp; In certain circumstances this may result in sanctions being applied by Job Centre Plus, details of these are available from <a title="Direct Gov" href="http://www.direct.gov.uk&#10;">www.direct.gov.uk.</a> </p>
<h3><a id="10" name="10"></a>Keeping you informed </h3>

<h3><a id="11" name="11"></a>Funding </h3>
<p>We, and our approved service providers, may use your personal data to process or to support any application made for funding associated with your learning. For these purposes we, or our approved service providers, will share the information you supply with the <a href="http://skillsfundingagency.bis.gov.uk/">Skills Funding Agency (SFA)</a> in England. The SFA may in turn share it with the European Social Fund, or other government agencies that may provide funding for your course, including the <a href="http://www.wales.gov.uk/">Welsh Assembly Government</a>&nbsp;for learners who enrol in Welsh centres. We may use a third party service to verify your identity for funding eligibility.&nbsp;If you are a learner between the ages of 16-19 years of age (or up to 25 years of age for learners with learning difficulties or disabilities), we are required by the Skills Funding Agency to notify Connexions when you leave, or intend to leave learning.

If you do not want us to use your personal data for these purposes, we will not be able to offer you the course at the reduced price. </p>
<p>At the point this information is collected you will be asked to indicate if you do not wish to be contacted by the SFA or its partners in respect of courses, surveys and research. Please read the&nbsp;SFA Data Protection Statement. </p>
<p>We, or the government agency providing funding for your course, may use your personal data and Learner File to investigate a suspected misuse of public monies or other fraudulent activity by any person relating to your learning activity. In doing so, we, or the government agency providing funding for your course, may disclose your information to other government agencies (e.g. the <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/">Department for Work and Pensions</a>) to establish whether there has been any duplication of funding for your course. We may also contact you for the purposes of any such investigation. </p>
<p><strong>SFA Privacy Notice</strong> </p>

<p><strong><em>How We Use Your Personal Information</em></strong> </p>
<p>The personal information you provide is passed to the Chief Executive of Skills Funding ("the Agency") and, when needed, the Department for Education, including the Education Funding Agency to meet legal duties under the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009, and for the Agency's Learning Records Service (LRS) to create and maintain a unique learner number (ULN). The information you provide may be shared with other partner organisations for purposes relating to education or training.</p>
<p>Further information about use of and access to your personal data, and details of partner organisations are available at:<br><a href="http://skillsfundingagency.bis.gov.uk/privacy.htm">http://skillsfundingagency.bis.gov.uk/privacy.htm</a>,<br>and<br><a href="http://www.learningrecordsservice.org.uk/documentlibrary/documents/Code+of+Practice+for+Sharing+of+Personal+Information.htm">http://www.learningrecordsservice.org.uk/documentlibrary/documents/Code+of+Practice+for+Sharing+of+Personal+Information.htm</a></p>
<p>If you want to change your options with the SFA or the LRS about their contacting you for surveys or research, or to tell you about courses and other learning opportunities, or how they can contact you, please contact your tutor.<br></p>
<h3><a id="12" name="12"></a>Statistics </h3>
<p>We and/or the approved&nbsp;service providers delivering and supporting your learning are also required to provide statistics to all of the government agencies mentioned under the heading 'Funding' and to the <a title="" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/">Department for Business, Innovation and Skills</a>, in order that they can carry out checks on our funding arrangements and our performance and for research and statistical purposes. This helps us, and our approved service providers, to maintain our funding. Where such information is supplied, it is provided in an aggregated manner so that whilst such authorities may be aware of, for example, the number, geographic location and sex of persons using <strong>learndirect,</strong> you cannot be personally identified from this information.<br>However, we may provide information that identifies you (your name, date of birth, address and postcode) to the Department of Work and Pensions so that they can check whether <strong>learndirect</strong> learners have progressed into employment and compile statistical information about such progression. You will not be identifiable from the statistical information compiled. </p>
<p>The information collected on Welsh speakers is passed in an aggregate manner to the Welsh Assembly. You cannot be personally identified from this information. </p>
<h3><a id="13" name="13"></a>Requests for information </h3>
<p>If you have not registered as a learner but are simply making an enquiry or request for information, we will use your personal information to reply to your enquiry or request. We will not use this information for marketing purposes without your permission or unless you invite us to do so. </p>
<h3><a id="14" name="14"></a>Protecting your personal information </h3>
<p>We are registered as a data controller (in our registered company name of&nbsp;<strong>learndirect</strong> Limited) in line with the UK Data Protection Act, 1998. As a registered data controller, we are required to take appropriate technical measures to protect your personal information including making a regular backup of our system and data. We have security measures in place to make sure any personal information we collect is secure. Your account is password protected and all information including your password is on a secure server, which only a limited number of employees and sub-contractors can access. All parties with access to your information are subject to confidentiality obligations. If you think someone else knows your password, or is using it, tell us immediately and change your password using the "change my password" option under "your details" on your learner home page. </p>
<p>Even though we take appropriate technical steps to protect your security, you should remember that data transmission over the internet cannot always be guaranteed as 100% secure so you use the website at your own risk. </p>

<li>for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for; </li>
<li>as required by law; or </li>
<li>to enforce or defend legal claims. </li></ul>
<p>Sometimes we will keep information that you have deleted, for example messages sent by you to your tutor, as a record of your learning experience. We will keep this information for a reasonable time. </p>

<p>Although anyone can take part in competitions and promotions, we will send notice of a win or prize directly to the parent or guardian identified during registration. Where a winner is under 18, we will not publish his or her personal details unless we have obtained the consent of the parent or guardian during registration. </p>
