<h3>
    Scope
</h3>
<p>
    This notice provides a summary of the full <strong>learndirect</strong>
    Privacy Statement. Both the notice and the <strong>learndirect</strong>
    Privacy Statement apply to information collected by Ufi Limited via the

    and in any manner described in the <strong>learndirect</strong> Privacy
    Statement.

<h3>
    Personal Information
</h3>
<p>
    We collect personal data about you when you enrol as a learner.
    [<a title="" href="http://www.learndirect.co.uk/privacystatement/#2">Further
       Information</a>]. At enrolment, we may ask you for
       <a href="http://www.learndirect.co.uk/privacystatement/#7">sensitive
       personal data</a> and for your consent to use it for a specific purpose.
       If you do not wish to provide this information, you way select the Not
       Known/Not Provided option.
</p>
<p>
    We share some of your personal data with the Managing Information Across
    Partners (MIAP) service, operated by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC).
    MIAP offers a Learner Registration Service to allocate Unique Learner
    Numbers (ULNs) which enable individuals to access their participation and
    achievement data. MIAP will share your Ufi participation and achievement
    data with other organisations if you tell Ufi that you are happy for MIAP
    to do so. [<a title="" href="http://www.learndirect.co.uk/privacystatement/#miap">Further
       information</a>].
</p>
<p>
    If government funding is available for your course, we collect personal
    data from you to see if you can have that funding. [<a title="" href="http://www.learndirect.co.uk/privacystatement/#3">Further
       information</a>].
</p>
<p>
    When you access your course materials we collect information about how you
    use those materials.
</p>
<p>
    We collect certain personal data about you when you enter competitions.
    [<a title="" href="http://www.learndirect.co.uk/privacystatement/#5">Further

<p>
    You may provide us with further personal data if you use one of our
    learning or communications facilities or use one of our online skills
    tests. [<a title="" href="http://www.learndirect.co.uk/privacystatement/#6">Further

<h3>
    <a id="1" name="1"></a>Giving information for other people
</h3>
<p>
    When you give us information about another person, the other person must
    have agreed to let :
</p>
<ul>
    <li>us process all their personal data; and
    </li>
    <li>you receive any data protection notices for them.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When you send information for someone else, you are confirming that you
    have told them :
</p>
<ul>
    <li>which data they must give;
    </li>
    <li>which information is voluntary; and
    </li>
    <li>how they can access and, if necessary, correct the data we hold about
    them.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <a id="2" name="2"></a>The information we collect during the enrolment process
</h3>
<p>
    When you enrol with us, you (or the person enrolling you) must tell us :
</p>
<ul>
    <li>your full name;
    </li>
    <li>your gender
    </li>
    <li>your date of birth;
    </li>
    <li>your address (and correspondence address if different);
    </li>
    <li>primary telephone number;
    </li>
    <li>your employment status;
    </li>
    <li>where you heard about us;
    </li>
    <li>if you have done any learning in the last three years.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We also request other information including your title, middle name, email
    address,National Insurance number and if you are a Welsh speaker, but you
    don't have to give us these details. Following enrolment via the website,
    we, or our approved learning providers, may request additional personal
    data from you in order to further support your learning. You do not have to
    provide this information, but if you do not, you may not get the most out
    of your learning. However, we ask you to tell us whether you have achieved
    Level 2 in English and Maths.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that when you enrol on a <strong>learndirect</strong> course
    that leads to qualification such as an NVQ, we send non sensitive personal
    information to the relevant awarding bodies so that they can undertake the
    administration associated with your qualification.
</p>
<p>
    Before you enrol, we will give you a username and ask you for a password.
    You will also be given a learner reference number and asked to give the
    answer to a question you choose which will identify you.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="3" name="3"></a>Other information we collect to see if you can have
        government funding
</h3>
<p>
    If government funding is available for any of our courses, you need to
    answer some other questions to see if you are eligible for funding. If you
    wish to take advantage of any such funding, you will be asked about :
</p>
<ul>
    <li>your age;
    </li>
    <li>your education so far;
    </li>
    <li>your citizenship status; and
    </li>
    <li>where you live and how long you have lived there.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We, or our approved learning providers, may require additional information
    from you in order to support an application for funding. If you do not want
    to provide us with this information, we will not be able to offer you the
    course at the reduced price.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="learner" name="learner"></a>Learner File
</h3>
<p>
    When you start your learning your Learning Provider will create a Learner
    File to hold the documents which relate to your learning and evidence of
    proof of identity and funding eligibility. As you progress through your
    learning other documents, including some of your course work, may be held
    on this file which Ufi/<strong>learndirect</strong> requires the Learning
    Provider to keep on its behalf.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="4" name="4"></a>The information we collect when you access course
        materials
</h3>
<p>
    We collect information about how you use course materials to monitor your
    learning and improve our users' learning experience.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="5" name="5"></a>The information we collect when you enter competitions
</h3>
<p>
    From time to time we may run competitions and promotions on the website. If
    you enter these, we may ask for your name, address, email address and
    username so that we can administer and control the competition and, of
    course, notify the winners.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="6" name="6"></a>Other information we collect
</h3>
<p>
    If you require a free information pack, we ask you to provide us with the
    information on the "request more information" form on the website,
    including :
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Title;
    </li>
    <li>Full name;
    </li>
    <li>Full address;
    </li>
    <li>An indication of courses in which you are interested;
    </li>
    <li>Whether you would like to know where your nearest
    <strong>learndirect</strong> centres are;
    </li>
    <li>Where you heard about us.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can also decide to give us your home and mobile telephone numbers and
    your email address but you only need to do this if you want us and/or our
    approved learning providers to contact you about
    <strong>learndirect</strong> developments and offers in this way.
</p>
<p>
    If you are not registered as a <strong>learndirect</strong> learner but use
    one of our online tests to test your skills, we ask you to provide your
    full name and email address. This information is not retained by us but is
    used only when sending you your test results.<br>
    You may also provide personal data through:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>calls to our helplines;
    </li>
    <li>letters and email;
    </li>

    help us deliver our services to you.
</p>
<p>
    We may also give your information to third parties who may take over part
    or all of the <strong>learndirect</strong> business in the future, but only

</p>
<p>
    Communications between you and your tutor using any of the tools or
    functions we make available to you (including unopened messages sent via
    our messaging system) may be monitored by <strong>learndirect</strong>
    staff to check the quality of tutor support. <strong>learndirect</strong>
    staff and auditors may also access these communications when we want to
    investigate or audit learner funding arrangements.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="10" name="10"></a>Keeping you informed
</h3>
<p>
    We, and our approved learning providers, will use your information to send
    you regular updates about :
</p>
<ul>
    <li>our services and materials;

    feedback purposes). If you do wish to receive information about
    <strong>learndirect</strong> developments and offers by telephone, email
    and/or SMS, please invite us to contact you by ticking the appropriate
    boxes. If at any time, you change your mind about receiving updates, you

</p>
<h3>
    <a id="11" name="11"></a>Funding
</h3>
<p>
    We, and our approved learning providers, may use your personal data to
    process or to support any application made for funding associated with your
    learning. For these purposes we, or our approved learning providers, will
    share the information you supply with the
    <a href="http://www.lsc.gov.uk/">Learning and Skills Council (LSC)</a> in
    England. The LSC may in turn share it with the European Social Fund, or
    other government agencies that may provide funding for your course,
    including the <a href="http://www.wales.gov.uk/">Welsh Assembly
    Government</a>&nbsp;for learners who enrol in Welsh centres. We may use a
    third party service to verify your identity for funding
    eligibility.&nbsp;If you are a learner between the ages of 16-19 years of
    age (or up to 25 years of age for learners with learning difficulties or
    disabilities), we are required by the LSC to notify Connexions when you
    leave, or intend to leave learning. We, or our approved learning providers,
    may also share it with the Office for Standards in Education, Children’s
    Services and Skills (Ofsted) so that it can check our use of public monies.
    If you do not want us to use your personal data for these purposes, we will
    not be able to offer you the course at the reduced price.
</p>
<p>
    At the point this information is collected you will be asked to indicate if
    you do not wish to be contacted by the LSC or its partners in respect of
    courses, surveys and research. Please read the
    <a title="LSC Data Protection Statement" href="http://www.theia.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/BC2A0B4A-CDBE-45D6-9B26-87BB95914AAA/0/natilrspecification2009_10Appendix_fsp03Jul2009v2.pdf" target="_blank">LSC Data Protection Statement</a> [pdf].
</p>
<p>
    We, or the government agency providing funding for your course, may use
    your personal data and Learner File to investigate a suspected misuse of
    public monies or other fraudulent activity by any person relating to your
    learning activity. In doing so, we, or the government agency providing
    funding for your course, may disclose your information to other government
    agencies (e.g. the <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/">Department for Work and
    Pensions</a>) to establish whether there has been any duplication of
    funding for your course. We may also contact you for the purposes of any
    such investigation.

    Managing Information Across Partners (MIAP) and the Unique Learner Number
    (ULN)
</h3>
<p>
    The Managing Information Across Partners (MIAP) service is operated by the
    Learning and Skills Council (LSC) for learners aged 14 years and over and
    learners registering for relevant post-14 qualifications.&nbsp; MIAP is
    responsible for the operation of the Learner Registration Service and also
    the creation of a Learner Record.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Learner Registration Service (LRS)</em>
</p>
<p>
    By enrolling with Ufi, you agree to us providing MIAP with the following
    personal data so that MIAP can allocate you a Unique Learner Number (ULN):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Given Name
    </li>
    <li>Family Name
    </li>
    <li>Gender
    </li>
    <li>Date of birth
    </li>
    <li>Postcode
    </li>
    <li>Details of how your identity was verified
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The LRS will enable organisations listed in section 537A of the Education
    Act (<a href="http://www.miap.gov.uk/">www.miap.gov.uk</a>) to access your
    ULN and verify the details used to create your ULN, thereby saving you
    having to supply the same information repeatedly to different
    organisations.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <em>Learner Record</em>
</p>
<p>
    By enrolling with Ufi, you also agree to us providing your participation
    and achievement data to MIAP so that MIAP can create and maintain a Learner
    Record.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ULN will enable you to access the Ufi
    participation and achievement data held in your Learner Record via a
    website and will allow MIAP to share this data with those organisations
    listed in section 537A of the Education Act
    (<a href="http://www.miap.gov.uk/">www.miap.gov.uk</a>), if you tell Ufi
    that you are happy for MIAP to do so. You can decide to opt out of MIAP
    sharing your participation and achievement data at any time and current
    details of how to do so can be found at
    <a href="http://www.miap.gov.uk/">www.miap.gov.uk</a> or by telephoning
    0845 6022589.
</p>
<p>
    MIAP may use and disclose anonymised information pulled from Learner
    Records for statistical purposes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Ufi is not responsible for MIAP's privacy practices and you should read
    about such practices at
    <a href="http://www.miap.gov.uk/">www.miap.gov.uk</a>.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="12" name="12"></a>Statistics
</h3>
<p>
    We and/or the approved learning providers delivering and supporting your
    learning are also required to provide statistics to all of the government
    agencies mentioned under the heading 'Funding' and to the
    <a href="http://www.dius.gov.uk/">Department for Innovation, Universities
    and Skills</a>, in order that they can carry out checks on our funding
    arrangements and our performance and for research and statistical purposes.
    This helps us, and our approved learning providers, to maintain our
    funding. Where such information is supplied, it is provided in an
    aggregated manner so that whilst such authorities may be aware of, for
    example, the number, geographic location and sex of persons using
    <strong>learndirect,</strong> you cannot be personally identified from this
    information.<br>
    However, we may provide information that identifies you (your name, date of
    birth, address and postcode) to the Department of Work and Pensions so that
    they can check whether <strong>learndirect</strong> learners have
    progressed into employment and compile statistical information about such
    progression. You will not be identifiable from the statistical information
    compiled.
</p>
<p>
    The information collected on Welsh speakers is passed in an aggregate
    manner to the Welsh Assembly. You cannot be personally identified from this
    information.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="13" name="13"></a>Requests for information
</h3>
<p>
    If you have not registered as a learner but are simply making an enquiry or
    request for information, we will use your personal information to reply to
    your enquiry or request. We will not use this information for marketing
    purposes without your permission or unless you invite us to do so.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="14" name="14"></a>Protecting your personal information
</h3>
<p>

    Ufi Limited) in line with the UK Data Protection Act, 1998. As a registered
    data controller, we are required to take appropriate technical measures to
