        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LeaseTrader.com 
          is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will 
          not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different 
          from what is disclosed in this statement. LeaseTrader.com collects information 
          from our users at several different points on our website.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Registration<br>
          In order to use some features of this website, a user must first complete 
          the registration form. During registration a user is required to give 
          their contact information (such as name and email address). This information 
          is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which 
          they have expressed interest. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Order<br>
          We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user 
          must provide contact information (like name and address) and financial 
          information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information 
          is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders. If 
          we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used 
          to get in touch with the user.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cookies<br>
          A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing 
          information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to 
          any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the 
          user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, 
          by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a 
          password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a 
          user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback 
          to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. 
          For example, the user will not be able to participate in any of our 
          Sweepstakes, Contests or monthly Drawings that take place. Cookies can 
          also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance 
          the experience on our site.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some of our business 
          partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, 
          we have no access to or control over these cookies.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Log Files<br>
          We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s 
          movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 
          IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sharing<br>
          We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and 
          advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can 
          identify any individual person.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We use an outside 
          credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. 
          These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable 
          information for any secondary purposes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We partner with 
          another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for 
          these services, we will share names, or other contact information that 
          is necessary for the third party to provide these services.<br>
          These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information 
          except for the purpose of providing these services.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Links<br>
          This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we 
          LeaseTrader.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of such 
          other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our 
          site and/or link into another site with a LeaseTrader.com frame surrounding 
          that site, to read the privacy statements of each and every web site 
          that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement 
          applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Newsletter<br>
          If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we may ask for contact 
          information such as name and email address. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Surveys &amp; Contests<br>
          From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys 
          or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely 
          voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose 
          this information. Information requested may include contact information 
          (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip 
          code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners 
          and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring 
          or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tell-A-Friend<br>
          If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend 
          about our site, we ask them for the friend’s name and email address. 
          LeaseTrader.com will automatically send the friend a one-time email 
          inviting them to visit the site. LeaseTrader.com stores this information 
          for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may 
          contact LeaseTrader.com at customerservice@leasetrader.com to request 
          the removal of this information from their database.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Security<br>
          This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. 
          When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information 
          is protected both online and off-line.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When our registration/order 
          form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card 
          number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted 
          and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - 
          SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on 
          the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft 
          Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, 
          when you are just ‘surfing’. To learn more about SSL, follow 
          this link [INSERT LINK]. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While we use SSL 
          encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything 
          in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ 
          information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is 
          restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to 
          perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer 
          service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable 
          information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers 
          when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their 
          password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees 
          are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, 
          as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified 
          and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they 
          can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected. Finally, 
          the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are 
          kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you have any 
          questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to 
          customer customerservice@leasetrader.com.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Special Offers<br>
          We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. 
          Established members will occasionally receive information on products, 
          services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy 
          of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. 
          Please see our choice and opt-out below.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Site and Service 
          Updates<br>
          We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members 
          are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain 
          important information about the service. We communicate with the user 
          to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their 
          account via email or phone.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Correction/Updating 
          Personal Information:<br>
          If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as 
          your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will 
          endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s 
          personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the member 
          information page or by emailing our Customer Support. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Choice/Opt-out<br>
          Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having 
          their information used for purposes not directly related to our site 
          at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our order 
          form has an ‘opt-out’ mechanism so users who buy a product 
          from us, but don’t want any marketing material, can keep their 
          email address off of our lists. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Users who no longer 
          wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners 
          may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe 
          in the subject line in the email or email us at customerservice@leasetrader.com.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Users of our site 
          are always notified when their information is being collected by any 
          outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice 
          as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside 
          party, or not.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Notification of 
          Changes<br>
          If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes 
          on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we 
          collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose 
          it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information 
          in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, 
          we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as 
          to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. 
          We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under 
          which the information was collected. <br>
