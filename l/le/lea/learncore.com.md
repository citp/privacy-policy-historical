**_C. EU–US Privacy Shield_**

1\. What is the EU-US privacy Shield?   
---  
  
In order to allow for export of personal data covered under the GDPR towards a US recipient, the GDPR requires that certain safeguards are put in place first. Under section 45 of the GDPR, such safeguards may be established by a so-called “adequacy decision” to be taken by the European Commission.

On July 12, 2016, the European Commission, through the “Commission implementing decision (EU) 2016/1250”, has accepted that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield ensures an adequate level of protection for Personal Data transferred from the EEA to organisations in the United States, to the extent covered under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, please see <https://www.privacyshield.gov/Program-Overview>.

_(Last update 21 December 2018)_  
  
2\. To what Showpad entity does the EU-US privacy Shield apply?   
  
**Showpad Inc**. with address 1 N State Street 11th Floor Chicago, IL 60603 United States adheres to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce and applies such principles when collecting, using, processing, and retaining Personal Data transferred from the European Union and the United Kingdom to the United States.

Showpad Inc. has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles, resulting in the fact that personal data originating from within the EEA as well as the United Kingdom may legally be exported to Showpad Inc. under this basis.

If there is any conflict between the terms in these Privacy Principles and the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework shall govern.

For purposes of enforcing compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, Showpad Inc. is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission.

3\. Transfer to third parties   
  
Where Showpad Inc., has received Your Personal Data in the United States and subsequently transfers that information to a third-party recipient (e.g. a subprocessor), and such third-party recipient processes Your personal data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, Showpad Inc. may be responsible under the Privacy Shield Principles to the extent Showpad Inc. is responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

4\. Binding arbitration
