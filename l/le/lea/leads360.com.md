## Information Collected on Leads360 Internet Sites and How It May Be Used

When you access and use a Leads360 Internet Site, there are 3 ways we may collect information about you:

  1. ### Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser

Leads360 collects information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser. This information typically includes the IP address of your Internet service provider, the name of your operating system (such as Macintosh ® or Windows ®) and the name and version of your browser (such as Internet Explorer ® or FireFox ®). The information we receive depends on the settings on your web browser. Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings. The information provided by your browser does not identify you personally. We use this information to create statistics that help us improve our sites and make them more compatible with the technology used by our Internet visitors.

  2. ### Information Collected By Placing a "Cookie" On Your Computer

Leads360 may obtain information about you by installing a "tag" on your computer's hard drive. This tag is known as a "cookie." All of our Leads360 Internet Sites use "session cookies." A session cookie is used to tag your computer with a computer-generated, unique identifier when you access our site. A session cookie does not identify you personally and expires after you close your browser. We use session cookies to collect statistical information about the ways visitors use our sites' which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page. We analyze this information in statistical form to better understand our visitor's interests and needs to improve the content and functionality of our sites.

Some Leads360 Internet sites also use "persistent cookies." These cookies do not expire when you close your browser; they stay on your computer until you delete them. By assigning your computer a unique identifier, we are able to create a database of your previous choices and preferences, and in situations where these choices or preferences need to be collected again, they can be provided by us automatically, saving you time and effort.

If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. Although you are not required to accept cookies when you visit a Leads360 Internet Site, you may be unable to use all of the functionality of the site if your browser rejects our cookies.

We may also use the information we collect on Leads360 Internet Sites for various business purposes such as customer service, fraud prevention, market research, improving our products and services, and providing you and your company with information and offers we believe may be of interest to you.

In certain, limited circumstances we may share or transfer personal information to unrelated third parties. For example, we may provide personal information to a third party (i) at your request; (ii) to comply with a legal requirement or court order; (iii) to investigate a possible crime, such as identity theft; (iv) in connection with the sale, purchase, merger, reorganization, liquidation or dissolution of Leads360 or a Leads360 business unit; or (v) under similar circumstances.

For example, we use secure socket layer (SSL) technology to transfer personal information over the Internet.
