Introduction

The General Data Protection Regulation ( **GDPR** ) seeks to protect and enhance the rights of data subjects. These rights cover the safeguarding of personal data, protection against the unlawful processing of personal data and the unrestricted movement of personal data within the EU. GDPR does not apply to information already in the public domain.

It explains what personal information we collect, how we collect and use that personal information, with whom we will share it, why and in what circumstances.

Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data

We will only collect, process, use, share and store your personal information where we are satisfied that we have an appropriate legal basis for doing so. This may be because:

  * we need to use your personal information to take steps to enter into a contract with you or to meet our contractual obligations to you;
  * we need to use your personal information to respond to marketing or other enquiries from you;
  * we need to use your personal information to pursue our legitimate interests as a commercial organisation;
  * we have your consent to using your personal information for a particular activity (for example, where you have consented to us sharing with you marketing or promotional communications from members of the LUFC and/or its official partners, sponsors, suppliers or licensees which we think may be of interest).
