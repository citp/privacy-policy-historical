### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, leethax.net collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. leethax.net’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how leethax.net’s visitors use its website. From time to time, leethax.net may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. 

leethax.net also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for users engaging in interactions on the website, such as leaving comments or participating in the website poll. leethax.net does not disclose such information to third parties, except as explained below. 

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to leethax.net choose to interact with leethax.net in ways that require leethax.net to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that leethax.net gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, visitors may optionally enter an e-mail address when leaving comments. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

leethax.net will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. leethax.net discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when leethax.net believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of leethax.net, third parties or the public at large. If you have supplied your e-mail address to leethax.net, leethax.net may occasionally send you an email to contact you regarding the context where you entered your e-mail address, such as notifications of new features or to solicit your feedback. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. leethax.net takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
