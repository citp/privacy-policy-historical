Lee Jeans values its customers and respects their privacy. Customer information is collected in an effort to improve your online experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, contests and promotions. Lee Jeans only communicates with you in specific relation to an order placed or if you register to be notified of special deals, or enter a contest or promotion on our family of Web sites. We do not share, trade or sell your information to anyone outside of Lee Jeans or VF Corporation, our parent company, without your prior consent.

 **WHAT INFORMATION DOES LEE JEANS COLLECT?**

We need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status.

When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address, and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.

We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to our Web site, new Lee Jeans services, and special offers we think you might find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, visit your Lee Jeans registration page to change your preferences. Make sure to change your preferences for each account or e-mail address with which you have provided us.

 **HOW DOES LEE JEANS USE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?**

Lee Jeans currently uses the personal information collected for correspondence, record keeping, order shipments and charges, and activities on Lee Jeans. The information may also be used for the fulfillment of requested transactions and marketing, only when your consent is given for such marketing.

In the future, Lee Jeans may use additional information collected in surveys, such as hobbies, personal interests and similar topics.

 **DOES LEE JEANS SHARE ANY INFORMATION IT COLLECTS WITH OUTSIDE PARTIES?**

Lee Jeans does not disclose any personal information collected to outside parties. Lee Jeans may retain outside parties to review certain personal information to advise on demographic and marketing issues. This is typically on an aggregated basis, and only after such outside parties have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of any personal information obtained.

In the future, Lee Jeans may disclose personal information, with your prior consent, to companies with which it is affiliated by common ownership.
