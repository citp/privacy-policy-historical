LeetCode, LLC ("we”, “us”, or “our") provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we may receive from users of our website (“Site”) and any other services offered by us in connection with our site (any and all of the foregoing the "Services"). 

  


### INFORMATION COLLECTION: PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

In the course of using the Services, we collect personally identifiable information, in the form of Persistent Identifiers, including IP Address. We collect and stores this personal information solely for the purpose of providing support for the internal operations of our Services and our Site. 

  


### COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES

Like many websites and applications, we use ''cookies'' to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We may use ''session ID cookies'' to enable certain features of the Site or Services, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor web traffic routing on the site and aggregate usage of the site and services. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Services. 

  


### INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

WE WILL NOT SHARE, SELL, RENT, OR TRADE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHER PARTIES EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW: 

Through our terms and services, you have consented to the dissemination of this information to the third parties. Such information shall be limited to your name as provided with your account, the amount associated with the use of the account, and when any such activity took place. If you do not consent to this information, we will provide you with an opportunity to opt out of the sharing of the information. 

Personal Information: We may share personal information including IP Address, for the purpose of providing support for the internal operations of our services and our site. 

"Support for the internal operations of our Services and our Site" means activities necessary for the services or site to maintain or analyze its functioning; perform network communications; authenticate users or personalize content; serve contextual advertising or cap the frequency of advertising; protect the security or integrity of the user, service, or site; ensure legal or regulatory compliance; or perform other usage analytics. Through our services and site, no other personal information is collected and the persistent identifiers are not used or disclosed to contact a specific individual, including through behavioral advertising; to amass a profile on a specific individual; or for any other purpose. 

Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information. We may share aggregated information that includes non-identifying information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling, and to deliver contextual advertising about other products and services. 

Services Providers. We employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our services (such as maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of our Services' features), to provide the services on our behalf, or to assist us in analyzing how services are used. These third parties have access to your personal information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. 

Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity. 

We also reserve the right to disclose information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; protect us from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Services or Site; enforce our Terms of Service; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of us, our users, or others. 

  


### BUSINESS TRANSFERS

We may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. Such transfer will comply with all applicable laws and regulations. 

  


### SECURITY 

We are concerned with the security of your personal information and are committed to taking reasonable steps to protect it from unauthorized access and use. To that end, we put in place the appropriate physical, electronic and managerial policies and procedures designed to secure Personal Information. We also continue to implement procedures to maintain accurate, complete and current Personal Information. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is one hundred percent secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal information (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on the site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. 

  


### INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER

Your information may be transferred to - and maintained on - computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, we may transfer the personal information to the United States and processes it there. Use of our services or site represents your consent to this Privacy Policy and your agreement to that transfer. 

  


### LINKS TO OTHER SITES

Our services may contain links to other websites, applications, and online services. If you choose to visit a third party service or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party's website, application, or online service. The fact that we link to a website, content is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites or services. These other websites or services may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites and services you use.
