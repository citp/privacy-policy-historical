**5\. Purpose of processing - automated collection of personal information**

When you access our web pages certain information your browser provides, including your IP address at the time, browser type, and potentially the address of the page you last visited, will be automatically recorded by the University. This data may be used to aid detection in the event of a security breach. The legal basis for this processing is necessity to pursue our legitimate interests to keep our website secure.

These partners are only allowed to use your data in accordance with the strict instructions of the University. Neither partner will use your data in any other way nor will they share it with any other organisation.

The University’s policies on retaining data for prospective and current students, staff and job applicants are detailed in our [data retention policy](http://www.leeds.ac.uk/secretariat/documents/retention_policies.pdf "Data retention policy PDF").
