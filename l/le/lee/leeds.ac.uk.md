**1\. Purpose of this notice**

This notice tells you how the University of Leeds will collect and process your personal data when you access this website. 

**2\. Automated collection of personal information**

As with most other web servers, when you access these web pages certain information you provide will automatically be recorded by the University. This will include your IP address, browser type, and information relating to the page you last visited. This information is processed to estimate how much use of the server is made by different categories of users and, in the event of a breach of security, may be used to aid detection.

**3\. Non-automated collection**

Where you are required under this website to provide personal data, the uses of this data will be indicated at the point of collection - for example, when requesting a brochure or registering for an event.

**4\. Third-party access**

Your personal data that you have provided will not routinely be sent to third parties (unless notified - see 3. above).

**Exception - 100 % online distance learning postgraduate courses**

The University works with third party partners (Pearson PLC, Natives Online Ltd) who handle admissions enquiries and recruitment for some of our 100% online distance learning postgraduate courses. If you submit an enquiry through the online form published on the associated course pages, our partner organisation will use your personal data to enable them to respond to your enquiry. If you choose to apply for the course, your data will be entered into the University’s application system so we can consider your application. Your data is held confidentially and securely (our systems are encrypted). These partners are only allowed to use your data in accordance with the strict instructions of the University. Neither partner will use your data in any other way nor will they share it with any other organisation.
