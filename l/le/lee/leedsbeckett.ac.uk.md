### Information we collect from visitors for our own use

We collect several kinds of information from visitors to www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk depending on the part of the site being visited: e-mail enquiries, student recruitment, e-mail addresses, site usage information and, in a few cases, personal details such as your name and postal details if you order publications/documents to be sent or register for a service provided by the University (for example, the student accommodation service).

### Where we store your personal data

The data we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, amongst other things, the provision of support services. 

By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. Leeds Beckett will take such reasonable steps as necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

You should be aware that, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.

### Site usage information and cookies

Cookies are pieces of data created when you visit a site and are stored in the cookie directory of your hard drive. They generally do not expire at the end of your session. Cookies do not contain any personal information about you and cannot be used to identify an individual user. They are used to help you when you return to a website. 

For example, they may enable you to return directly to a particular part of the site by 'remembering' where you last accessed. If you choose not to accept the cookies (by setting your browser to reject them), this should not affect your access to the majority of facilities available on our website.

### Where cookies are used

### Linking to other sites from the Leeds Beckett website

The Leeds Beckett website contains many links to other sites, to help you find the information you need. 

These may be 'official partners' of Leeds Beckett or other third parties with information likely to be of interest and relevance to those using our website. Leeds Beckett is not responsible for the privacy practices of the organisations that operate these other sites. 

You should be aware of this when you leave www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk and, if concerned, read the privacy statements on the other websites you visit.

### Advertising

We may use advertising on parts of the public (Internet) or private (Intranet access only) parts of the Leeds Beckett website. 

No information will be passed to such advertisers or their agents about those using the Leeds Beckett website unless such users 'click through' to a specific advertiser's site and offer their personal details directly to the advertiser.
