During a normal visit to our site, no personally identifiable information about you is collected. All
information on our site is free to browse at your leisure without the need for you to provide us with any
personally identifiable information. Leer.com collects other information, non-personally identifiable
information from site visitors. This means that we do not track these items on an individual basis that
identifies the site visitor, but rather gather and collect this information on an aggregate [or anonymous]
basis that includes all site visitors. Non-personal information includes tracking the site pages that are
visited, the amount of time spent on our site, clicks, page views, events (which shopping tools you
interacted with), and zip code.
Our primary goal in collecting aggregate information from you is to be able to perform site metrics that
allow us to improve the functionality of the Web site. We need to collect aggregate information in order
to track page visits, site click through analysis, peak site usage times and site layout re-design.
We may use session and persistent "cookies," session logs, or links to collect aggregate or other non-
personally identifiable information about site visitors. An explanation for each of these items and how
they work is included in Section 7 Methods We Use to Collect Information.
How We Use the Aggregate or Non-Personally Identifiable Information We Collect:
Non-Personally identifiable information collected on leer.com may be used to:
        Compile aggregate and statistical data to help in Web site design and to identify popular
         features
        Measure site activity to allow us to update our site to better meet user wants and needs
Leer.com utilizes session log data and your personal and non-personal data for the purpose of
performing analytics on the users' experience while visiting this site. This analysis:
        Is performed on an aggregate level and does not identify you or your information personally
        Involves the use of a third party vendor acting on behalf of leer.com
        Is performed in order to improve our Web site and the user experience
Any information that is provided to the third party vendor is to be used only for the purpose of
performing the analytics and compiling reports of the data. The third party vendor is restricted from
using this data in any other way other than to provide these services to Truck Accessories Group, LLC
and they may not share or resell this data
Methods We Use to Collect Information
A "cookie" is a small text file that helps us in many ways to make your visit to our Web site more
enjoyable and meaningful to you. For example, cookies avoid you having to log in every time you come
back to one of our Web sites. They also allow us to tailor a Web site or advertisement to better match
your interests and preferences. There are a couple different types of cookies.
A "session" cookie is stored only in your computer's working memory (RAM) and only lasts for your
browsing session. When you close all your browser's windows, or when you shut down your computer,
the session cookie disappears forever.
A "persistent" cookie is stored on your computer's hard drive until a specified date, which could be
tomorrow, next week, or 10 years from now. Persistent cookies stay on your computer until either a)
they expire, b) they are overwritten with newer cookies, c) you manually remove them. Most browsers
can be configured not to accept cookies, however, this may prevent you from having access to some site


functions or features.
Leer.com may use spot light ads/web beacons/GIF/pixel tags which are site instrumentation tools that
help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times.
When you ask us to send you information on a promotion or a newsletter, we may use web beacons to
establish how many of the emails are actually opened. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of
a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon.
When you visit our Web site the server housing the pages automatically generates a "session log." We
use session logs to help us determine how people travel through our site. In this way, we can structure
our pages so that the information most frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can
also determine if the information we're providing is being used. The only data gathered is the Internet
Protocol (IP) address from which you came (which contains no personal information), the web site that
referred you, the pages you visited and the date and time of those visits.
Users may be directed to leer.com via banner ads or site links. Ads or site links that are placed by
leer.com use cookies or web beacons to deliver metrics on the effectiveness of the ads or links. They do
not collect personal information from the user.
