**Information We Share with Others and Your Privacy Rights**  
We contract with other companies to provide certain services, including shipping, name and address verification, email distribution, market research, promotions management and payment processing (to view PayPal's privacy policy, please visit <https://www.paypal.com/privacy>). We provide these companies with only the information they need to perform their services and work closely with them to ensure that your privacy is respected and protected. These companies are prohibited by contract from using this information for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with anyone other than L.L.Bean.

From time to time, we make our mailing list (names and addresses only) and general shopping activity available to reputable companies whose products we believe will be of interest to you and whose privacy practices meet the Direct Marketing Association's privacy standards. We do not share email addresses for this purpose. If you do not want to receive mailings from other reputable companies and prefer that we do not share any information with these companies, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/customerService/contactUs/index.html).

If you apply for the L.L.Bean Visa Card, you provide the financial and personal information needed to process your application directly to Barclays Bank Delaware, the issuer and the administrator of the credit card program. Barclays Bank Delaware is independent of L.L.Bean and has its own privacy and security policies. You can review their policies at [_www.barclaycardus.com_](http://www.barclaycardus.com/).

On rare occasions, we may disclose specific information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, or when required by law to do so. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.

**Your Choices about Communication from L.L.Bean**  
We offer choices about the types of information you receive from us. If you prefer not to receive catalogs or email updates from L.L.Bean or if you prefer to receive them less frequently, please visit the [My Account](https://www.llbean.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ShowCustPref?storeId=1&nav=gn&langId=-1&krypto=cOM7HFxPG0rAqX2cCWcHE%2BNpVGSpBYUr1pVSFBWH49g%3D) section of llbean.com or contact us at the address shown below.

Please be sure to provide us your exact name and address, or the mailing label from your catalog, so that we can be sure to identify you correctly. Because mailings are planned in advance, it may take several weeks for your request to become effective. If, due to human error, you continue to receive unwanted communications, please contact us again and we will make every effort to correct the situation.

Pixel tags also enable us to send you email in a format you can read and let us know when you have opened an email message from us.

We may also contract with other companies who use cookies or other online tools such as pixel tags to measure the performance of a marketing effort on our behalf. We prohibit these companies from using this information for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with anyone other than L.L.Bean.

**How We Use Email**  
When you provide us your email address, we will email you as necessary to process your order, respond to a request or provide customer service.

Recipients of our email gift cards will receive an email notifying them of the gift and instructing them how to redeem it.

We may also send promotional email about products, special offers, services or events that we believe may be of interest to you. It is our intent to send promotional emails only to those persons who wish to receive them. We provide instructions on how to unsubscribe in each email and within the [My Account](https://www.llbean.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ShowCustPref?storeId=1&nav=gn&langId=-1&krypto=cOM7HFxPG0rAqX2cCWcHE%2BNpVGSpBYUr1pVSFBWH49g%3D) section of llbean.com.

We use a variety of current technologies and processes for protection of our customer data. We limit the information we provide to outside companies with whom we contract to only what they need to carry out their responsibilities. It is our practice to use encryption whenever we receive or transmit sensitive data.

When you make a purchase, request a catalog or create an account on our Web site, your transactional information is transmitted in a safe, encrypted format. See [About Security](https://web.archive.org/customerService/security/index.html) for details.
