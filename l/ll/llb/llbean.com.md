# About Your Privacy

**Your Privacy  **   
At L.L.Bean, we believe that understanding what our customers want for products, services and information is an important part of building an interesting and useful online environment. 

We've designed our site with this belief in mind, and we've created this privacy statement so that you have easy access to information about our privacy practices.

L.L.Bean is pleased to be a licensee of TRUSTe, an independent organization dedicated to fair information practices on Internet commerce sites. As a licensee, L.L.Bean agrees that TRUSTe will periodically review our privacy practices and this privacy statement for compliance with TRUSTe's standards.

**About the information we collect**     
L.L.Bean has a strong tradition of providing quality goods and excellent customer service. At llbean.com, our goal is not only to carry on this tradition, but also to provide an experience that is unique to the dynamic capabilities of the World Wide Web. 

Part of achieving this goal involves working with information that helps us understand what customers want when they visit llbean.com. We do this in two ways. First, we analyze customer information in aggregate – that is, we collect information about thousands of site visits and analyze it as a whole. This kind of study involves looking for trends among many visitors to llbean.com, rather than analyzing information about any individual customer. Examples include researching which parts of the site are accessed most frequently, or determining which banner ad generates the best response. 

Second, we may use information gathered during your visit to help customize our communications with you. For instance, if you choose to view or buy a pair of hiking boots at llbean.com, we might offer you a link to related products the next time you visit us online, or we might send you our latest Outdoors catalog by mail. 

In the end, we hope to tailor our communications with you to fit your needs – so that you receive more of what you want from us and less of what you don't want.

**Information we request, and how we use it**     
In several areas of llbean.com, we ask you to provide information by filling out and submitting an online form. Following is a list of the information we request, arranged by site location, and details on how we use this information. 

**• Checkout.** We ask for your name, address and contact information so we can send you your order, and so we can contact you if we have a question about your order. We ask for credit card information so we can fulfill your order, and so we can provide this information to the company or companies who process your credit card payment. We may share your name and address with other companies whose products we think you may be interested in. We do not share or sell email addresses.

**• Catalog requests.** We ask for a name and address to complete your request. We may share your name and address with other companies whose products we think you may be interested in.

**• My Account/Address Book.** When you register at llbean.com, we ask for your name, address, phone number, email address, and credit card information (optional). After registering, you have the option of creating a personal Address Book to save shipping addresses. We use the information to fulfill your orders, and we may share your name and address with other companies whose products we think you may be interested in. If you send an L.L.Bean gift to someone in your Address Book, we may contact them by postal mail about our products and services, but we never share their name or address with other companies. We do not share or sell email addresses.

**•  L.L.Bean Visa® online application.** We ask for name, address and financial information that MBNA, the issuer and administrator of the credit card program, needs to process your application. We do not share this information with anyone other than MBNA.

**• L.L.Bean Live Help SM and llbean.com email forms.** We ask for your name and email address, and for information to help us answer your question. If you have provided your email address to us only via Live Help or by sending us an email message, we may follow up on your question via email, but we will not send you email for marketing purposes. We do not share questions or comments provided in Live Help with any other company, and we do not share or sell email addresses.

**• LLB-Mail.** We ask you to provide a name, email address and profile information. We use this information only to fulfill your request and, in the case of profile information, to help make sure we're sending you the type of email updates and catalogs you want to receive. We do not share or sell email addresses.

**• Gift Cards and Gift Messages.** These options allow you to send a personal greeting with your gift order. We make no use of the information contained in these greetings except to complete your order as you have requested.

**Information we do not collect**     
When you visit our site, we do not collect your name, email address or any other personal information unless you provide it to us.

**Cookies  – what they are and how we use them**  
Cookies are small bits of text that your Web browser software stores on your computer when you visit some Web sites. L.L.Bean uses a cookie to help make it easier for you to use our site and to help us customize your experience so that we can provide you with the information you need – when and where you need it. 

A cookie generated by our site allows you, for example, to retrieve your llbean.com Shopping Cart and address information on a return visit. Cookies do not collect this information, nor is name, address or product information contained within the cookie itself. The cookie simply holds the "key" that, once interpreted by our site, is associated with this information. Because we rely on cookies to make the shopping experience easier and more tailored to your needs, your browser must be set to accept cookies before you can place an order at llbean.com. (You can change the cookie setting in your browser's Preferences, usually found in the Edit menu.)

We also use cookies to help us measure the success of our marketing efforts, so that we can better understand how to reach customers with the information they want about llbean.com.

**How we use email**     
After you place an order on our site, you will receive an email confirmation and, in most cases, an email with package tracking information. You will receive these emails only if you have provided your email address during checkout or as part of registering. Recipients of our Electronic Gift Certificate receive an email notifying them of the gift and giving them the information they need to redeem it.

We send LLB-Mail, our email update on sales and products, to subscribers and occasionally to other customers who we think might be interested in learning about sales and special events at our site. Unsubscribe instructions are included in each edition of LLB-Mail.

If you provide your email address only via Live Help or an llbean.com email form, we may send you email to follow up on your inquiry, but we will not use the address for marketing purposes. We do not sell or share email addresses with other companies. 

We _do_ use email as a means of receiving feedback from our customers, and we encourage you to [email us](https://web.archive.org/customerService/contactUs/contactUsEmail.html) with your questions or comments. We read every email we receive.

**Links to other sites**  
Occasionally we provide links to other sites we think you will enjoy. These sites operate independently of L.L.Bean and have established their own privacy and security policies. For the best online experience, we strongly encourage you to review these policies at any site you visit.

**About the information we share with others**     
If you provide us with your name and postal address, we may make it available to other companies who want to tell you about their products. (See below if you prefer that we not share this information.) We may segment the information into groups of customers who have bought similar amounts and types of products, but we never provide details that are specific to a single customer or household.  
 return to top 

    
**Information we do not share with others**     
L.L.Bean does not share, sell or trade email addresses, information collected as part of a survey or specific details about you or your household. We do not contribute to or participate in shared or cooperative databases, which give other companies access to your personal information. We do not release credit card or financial information for use by other companies (except in the case of financial information included in the online L.L.Bean® VISA® application, which we provide to MBNA, the issuer and administrator of the program). For privacy purposes, all information relating to our customers is stored on a highly secure server, and all credit card information is stored in an encrypted format. (See [About Security]() for details.)
