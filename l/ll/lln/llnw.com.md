We have no control over the data that is submitted to us through our platform. The scope of our services and the data provided to us for processing is subject to the contractual agreements we enter into with our customers.

We will retain the information you provide us and the data we process on behalf of our clients for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide our services.

"Cookies and Other Technologies" Information: When you access the Site or the Limelight Platform, we may send one or more cookies - small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer. Limelight may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser.

Our web pages, on both the Site and the Limelight Platform, contain electronic image requests (called a "single-pixel gif" or "web beacon" request) that allow us to count page views and to access cookies. Any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. Web beacons are typically 1-by-1 pixel files, but their presence can usually be seen within a browser by clicking on "View" and then on "Source." We also include web beacons in HTML-formatted newsletters that we send to opt-in subscribers in order to count how many newsletters have been read. Limelight web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor or share any personally identifiable information about our web site visitors, they are just the technique we use to compile anonymous information about web site usage. 

Some of our business partners (e.g. advertisers, analytics providers) use cookies and web beacons on our Site and the Limelight Platform (collectively referred to as "tracking technologies). We have no access to or control over these tracking technologies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Limelight only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.
