However, there are parts of this Website where we may need to collect personal information from you, including without limitation your name, post and email addresses, fax and telephone numbers, employment details, date of birth and banking details.  
 **3.  Use of information collected**  
3.1 Domain name information that we collect is not used to personally identify you and instead is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the Website, pages viewed etc. We use this information to measure the use of our Website and to improve its contents.  
3.2 When other personal information, such as your name and email address is collected from you (for example through online forms or via email etc) we generally let you know at the time of collection how we will use that personal information. We may also use the personal information you provide or which we collect via this Website for the purposes of:

You may tell us at any time if you change your mind. For more information on your marketing preferences please visit Your marketing preferences.  
3.3 Lloyds TSB group companies will treat your personal information as confidential but may share it with each other and disclose it outside the Lloyds TSB group companies if:   
• you consent;  
• it is needed by our agents, advisors or others involved in running accounts and services for you or collecting what you owe Lloyds TSB group companies;  
• HM Revenue & Customs or other authorities require it;

• the law or public interest permits or requires it;  
• required by us or others to investigate or prevent crime;  
• we need to provide it to a third party in anticipation of or following a sale, merger of the whole or any part of the Lloyds TSB group companies or in the course of a joint venture.    
3.4 All countries in the European Economic Area (including the UK) have similar standards of legal protection for your personal information. Lloyds TSB group companies may run your accounts and provide other services from centres outside the European Economic Area (such as the USA and India) that do not have the same standard of data protection laws as the UK. However, if we do, we will always have a contract in place to ensure that your personal information is protected at least to UK standards, and we will remain bound by our obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998.   
3.6 We may monitor, record, store and use any telephone, email or other communications we have with you for training purposes, so that we can check any instructions given to us, for crime prevention and to improve the quality of our customer service.

 **4.  Use of cookies**  
4.1 Cookies are small amounts of information that are stored on your computer to enable our server to collect certain information from your web browser.
