<h2>How your personal information is used by the Lloyds TSB Group*.</h2>
<p>Lloyds TSB Offshore Limited may keep your personal details, given to us by you or others during your relationship with us and other companies in the Lloyds TSB Group, in a Lloyds TSB database.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>details you give us on application forms or during conversations with you via phone bank or at any of our branches,</li>
	<li>details you give us so that we can provide you with non-financial goods and services,</li>
	<li>details we receive from credit reference and fraud detection agencies.</li>
</ul>

<p>You agree that we may use and update this centrally held information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>for credit and credit related services and to manage your accounts, </li>
	<li>to provide you with other services, </li>
	<li>to identify other products and services which might be suitable for you,</li>
	<li>to recover debts and to assist in debtor tracing,</li>
	<li>to prevent and detect fraud,</li>
	<li>to update our records about you,</li>
	<li>to prevent money laundering; and,</li> 
	<li>to check your identity.</li>
</ul>

<p>You agree that we may use your personal information to make a credit check on you before we provide you with any services. These searches will be recorded by the credit reference agencies. We may disclose information about how you run your accounts to the credit reference agencies. We and other organisations may also use credit reference agency and fraud prevention agency records that we receive about you, people financially linked to you and others in your household to help make decisions about you and them.</p>
<p>We may also use your information for research and statistical analysis with the aim of improving our services.</p>
<p>When assessing an application and managing your borrowing with us, we may use automated decision-making systems.</p>
<p>If you are applying for a card, loan or other service in joint names, this will create a financial link between both applicants in both our records and the records at the credit reference agencies. This means that your financial affairs and those of your joint applicant may be treated as affecting each other. A joint account means that we may give any information about that account to either of the applicants (even if you choose that both of you must sign instructions to us).</p>
<p>If you request it, on payment of a fee, which is currently £10, we will provide you with a copy of the personal information to which you are entitled that we hold about you.</p>
<p>The information we hold about you is confidential. We will only disclose it outside the Lloyds TSB Group when:</p>

<ul>
<li>you give us your consent,</li>
<li>it is needed by certain reputable third parties involved in running accounts and/or providing services for you (for example, credit reference agencies who do credit checks for us),</li>
<li>in order to obtain professional advice,</li>
<li>we or others need to investigate or prevent crime (e.g. to fraud prevention agencies),</li>
<li>the law permits or requires it, or any regulatory or governmental body requests or requires it, even without your consent, or,</li>
<li>there is a duty to the public to reveal the information.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may administer your account and provide other services from centres in countries outside Europe (such as India and the USA) that do not always have the same standard of data protection laws as the UK. However, we will have a contract in place to ensure that your information is adequately protected, and we will remain bound by our obligations under the Data Protection Act even when your personal information is processed outside Europe.</p>

<h2>Use of cookies</h2>
<p>This website uses cookies. Cookies collect information about your use of the website, including things like your connection speed, details of your operating system, the time and duration of your visit and your IP address. The information collected by cookies enables us to understand the use of our site, including the number of visitors we have, the pages viewed per session, time exposed to particular pages etc. This in turn helps us to provide you with a better experience, since we can evaluate the level of interest in the content of our website and tailor it accordingly. We will not attempt to personally identify you from your IP address unless required to as a matter of law or regulation or in order to protect our or our other customers’, rights. Most browsers automatically accept cookies. You can set your browser options so that you will not receive cookies and you can also delete existing cookies from your browser. However, you may find that some parts of the site will not function properly if you refuse cookies.</p>

<h2>Monitoring</h2>
<p>We may monitor, record, store and use any telephone, email or other electronic communications with you for training purposes, so that we can check any instructions given to us and to improve the quality of our customer service.</p>
<p>We will monitor network traffic from time to time for the purposes of backup and problem solving and in order to ensure that you are not misusing any of the services provided to you.</p>

<h2>Protecting your privacy</h2>
<p>To the extent that sensitive personal data is processed about you, we will employ appropriate security measures given the nature of that data. However, you recognise that your use of the Internet and our website is entirely at your own risk. We have tried to create a secure and reliable website for our users. However, we have no responsibility or liability for the security of personal information transmitted via the Internet.</p>
<p>We may need to provide some of your personal information to third parties that we use for the purposes of delivering specific services to you (e.g. customer support, or a shipping company if you have asked us to send something to you).</p>
<p>Our website may provide links and banner advertisements to third party sites. Please note that we are not responsible for, and have no control over, information that is submitted to or collected by these third parties. Since we do not control those websites, you are responsible for reviewing and abiding by the privacy policies of these third party sites.</p>
<p>In the course of providing services to you, we may engage third parties to carry out certain services/operations on our behalf and transfer your personal information outside of the European Economic Area. We will employ appropriate security measures to protect your personal data where that is the case.</p>

<h2>Accurate Information</h2>
<p>We may check what you have told us and share that information with fraud prevention agencies. It is important that you give us accurate information. If you give us false or inaccurate data and we suspect fraud we will record this at the fraud prevention agencies.</p>
<p>You are responsible for informing us that your personal details have changed: for example, a change of address or to your title. You confirm that you will inform us, by writing to your branch, of any change to your personal information as soon as is reasonably practicable in order that we may update our records. Please note that notification of any change to your personal information must be in writing, and should include your account numbers with us.</p>
<p>If you feel your privacy has been breached by us, then please write to:</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>You must not use any computers, computer equipment, network resources or any services provided by us for any illegal purpose, or for accessing, receiving or transmitting any material deemed illegal, indecent, offensive or otherwise unacceptable under UK law.</p>
<p>All passwords and usernames allocated to you must be kept secret and must not be disclosed to anyone without our prior written authorisation.</p>
<p>You must not use any false identity in email or other network communications.</p>
<p>You must not attempt or participate in the unauthorised entry or viewing of another user's account or into another system.</p>
<p>You must not use the services and/or network systems or any part thereof for fraudulent activities, or to breach another organisation's security (cross-network hacking). This is an illegal act and prosecution under criminal law may result.</p>

<h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Please note that this policy will be reviewed, and may change, from time to time. The revised policy will be posted to this page so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it.</p>

<h2>Decision Making</h2>
<p>Any decision made by us in relation to the services provided to you shall be final.</p>
