# LWN: LWN.net Privacy Statement

LWN cares deeply about the privacy of its readers, and is committed to doing everything it can to preserve that privacy. This document describes in detail the information we collect and how we manage it. Please do not hesitate to drop us a note at lwn@lwn.net if you have any questions. 

This is version $Revision: 1.4 $ of the LWN privacy policy. 

## What information we collect

The LWN.net server collects the usual information from your browser and network connection: your IP address, browser, referrer link, etc. This information is used to generate statistics within LWN so that we know what our readers are interested in and where they came from. 

If you create an account on LWN.net, we ask for your full name and an email address so that we may contact you. Possession of an LWN account also enables you to set various customization options, and to post comments on the site. Of course, we have no control over information you post in comments; you should not post anything you do not wish to have disclosed to the world. 

We also request (optionally) a small amount of demographic information when accounts are created. Provision of this information is not necessary to obtain an LWN account. 

If you purchase LWN advertising services or donate to LWN, we must collect some contact information and a credit card number. 

We also, of course, collect and retain any information you may send to us via email. 

## How we use your information

Information provided by you is used internally at LWN so that we may understand how our readers are using the site and how we may improve the user experience. 

With the following exceptions, we will not share your personal information with any third party. Your private information is private, and we intend to keep it that way. The exceptions are: 

  * Any information you post in a public location - such as comments - is necessarily public. 
  * Standard web server logs could be requested by an advertiser who wishes to audit an advertising campaign on LWN. Thus far, such an audit has never occurred. 
  * Credit card and transaction information must be shared with our credit card processing company. Note that we do _not_ retain credit card information on any server after the completion of a transaction. 
  * If we are presented with a valid search warrant (or some other sort of PATRIOT-style demand) by a government agency, we will, in all likelihood, have to comply. This has never happened since LWN begin publishing. 
  * Optional demographic information can be given - in statistical form, to potential advertisers. We will never release individual information, with or without an attached name. We do not use demographic information to direct specific advertising at you, or to change your LWN experience in any way. 



We may use your email address to contact you in limited, important situations. We will not use your address to send you advertising materials, for LWN or any other concern. If you sign up for any of LWN's mailing lists, we will, of course, send you the content that is relevant to that list. We will never subscribe you to a mailing list without an explicit request on your part. 

## Use of cookies

The LWN.net site does make use, currently, of two cookies. The `OASISID` cookie is used for the provision of advertisements on the site; in particular, it helps to ensure that clickthroughs are directed to the right place. 

If you create and use an LWN account, the `LWN_SESSION` cookie is needed to securely manage your sessions on the site.
