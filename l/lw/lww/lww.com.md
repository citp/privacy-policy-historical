LWW.com uses a browser feature known as **cookies** , which assigns a unique identification to your computer. Cookies are typically stored on your computer's hard drive and are used by LWW to keep track of your shopping cart, to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your account information so you don't have to re-enter it during the check-out/purchase process. 

How does LWW use the information I provide online?

The information we collect from **general browsing** allows us to see which areas of our web site are most visited and helps us better understand our visitors' experiences at LWW.com.

The **personal information** we collect will allow us to present you with a more customized experience on LWW.com, including offers that relate to the specialty you select, search results presented first by your designated specialty, and faster checkout. The information is also used to send you order confirmations and information about Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Unique identifiers (such as e-mail address and password) are collected to verify the user's identity, for use as account numbers in our record system, and for other purposes. When you supply your e-mail address, we use it to confirm your order, provide requested information, and otherwise respond to your communication. 

Does LWW.com share or sell my information with third parties?

We work with reputable third parties to assist us in delivering services to you. In these instances, we will provide your personal information to third parties so that they can perform these services. Third parties are required to hold the information in confidence and use it only for the purpose of delivering the service for which they were hired.
