                          We use third-party advertising companies to serve our
                          ads on the Internet. These third-party advertising companies
                          employ cookie and 1x1 pixel .gif technology to measure
                          and improve the effectiveness of ads for their clients.
                          To do so, these companies may use anonymous information
                          about your visits to our Web site and other Web sites.
                          This information can include: date/time of banner ad
                          shown, the banner ad that was shown, their cookie, the
                          IP address. This information can also be used for online
                          preference marketing purposes. <br>

                          <b>Consumer Information<br>
                          </b> During the process of delivering an ad to you,
                          LoveToKnow does not collect any personally identifiable
                          information about you—such as name, address, phone number,
                          or e-mail address. However, LoveToKnow does obtain some
                          types of nonpersonally identifiable information—such
                          as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect
                          to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer
                          operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for
                          example). The information collected by LoveToKnow is
                          used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring
                          ad effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers. In some
                          cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information
                          in response to a specific ad (the advertiser may ask
                          you to fill out a survey or provide your zip code).
                          If this does occur, LoveToKnow may collect this information
                          on behalf of an advertiser. This information is used
                          by an advertiser to respond to your request. In addition,
                          LoveToKnow may combine this information with other users’
                          information and review it in an aggregate form to understand
                          the type of people who view a specific type of ad or
                          visit a particular kind of website.<br>

                          <b>Data Collection </b><br>
                          LoveToKnow—as well as most sites on the Internet—use
                          “cookies” to enhance your experience on the web. What
                          are cookies and why do we use them? First, LoveToKnow
                          cannot use these cookies to identify you personally
                          in any way. A cookie is a unique number that is provided
                          to you the first time LoveToKnow—or any site that uses
                          cookies—serves an ad to you. This unique number, which
                          is stored in a cookie file on your computer, helps LoveToKnow
                          target ads to you. This cookie can help LoveToKnow ensure
                          that we do not serve you the same ad multiple times
                          and help our advertisers understand what you like and
                          do not like about their offerings so they can cater
                          better to your needs the next time you are interested
                          in their products or services. While we believe cookies
                          enhance your Internet experience by limiting the number
                          of times you see the same ad and delivering more relevant
                          content to you, they are not required for LoveToKnow
                          to deliver you an ad.<br>
                          <br>
                          If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is
                          a simple procedure to delete your cookies manually.
                          Please consult your web browser’s help documentation
                          for more information.<br>
