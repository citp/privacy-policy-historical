# Privacy Policy at LovelySkin.com

##### Dear Valued Customer,

We value your privacy. We do not sell or solicit your name, email address or other personal information to 3rd parties. By registering for our website, you may choose to receive special offers, via our product of the week, or also receive our monthly newsletter, which includes dermatology news and information. These mailings come directly from us based off of preferences you�ve chosen during your registration/ordering process. 

We know the importance of patient and customer privacy. Under the direction of Dr. Schlessinger (Board-Certified Dermatologist / Board-Certified Cosmetic Surgeon), we also operate a dermatology and cosmetic surgery practice, a research center which researches and tests new drugs and products in the industry, as well as a full-service medical day spa with licensed estheticians. We handle every patient�s medical information securely, under [our HIPAA compliance](http://www.lovelyskin.com/download/hippanoticeofprivacypractices.pdf), on a daily basis and treat our online customer's information with the same importance. 

We are also PCI compliant and will continue to run our business with this in mind. The Payment Card Industry (PCI) data security standard is a new security standard for how your credit card information is handled, stored, processed and transmitted. Our PCI compliance is verified by ScanAlert (now owned by McAfee) who also provides our HackerSafe certification which verifies our site is secure and ensures the safety of your information from hackers. Because of the number of transactions we process, we are required to follow these PCI compliance standards. These standards include a 12 step questionnaire about business practices as well as an entire network scan to ensure no vulnerability. Most sites out there are either not required to conform to these standards due to their small volume or from the use of 3rd party software, however, we guarantee the accuracy of our compliance and, more importantly, the safety of your personal and financial information. 

If you would like to read more information on PCI compliance, please [click here](http://www.mcafeesecure.com/us/pci-howitworks.jsp). 

We host and operate our website in-house and do not use 3rd party hosting or networking services. This allows us to have full control over our website and makes your information more secure. Many companies will use a 3rd party hosting company to store their website and your information in which multiple people unaffiliated with their business may have access to your information. 

Please contact me with any questions or concerns you may have with your privacy or security.
