## Protecting Your Information

We know the importance of patient and customer privacy. Under the direction of Dr. Schlessinger (board-certified dermatologist / board-certified cosmetic surgeon), we also operate a dermatology and cosmetic surgery practice, a research center and a day spa. We handle every patient's medical information securely, under our HIPAA compliance, on a daily basis and treat our online customer's information with the same importance. 

We use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") authentication to guarantee the confidentiality of online transactions made on our website. SSL authentication and encryption of the data that you send to us over the Internet help protect your online transaction information from being intercepted by third parties.

We are also PCI compliant and will continue to run our business with this in mind. The Payment Card Industry (PCI) data security standard is a new security standard for how your credit card information is handled, stored, processed and transmitted. Our PCI compliance is verified by ScanAlert (now owned by McAfee) who also provides our HackerSafe certification that verifies our site is secure and ensures the safety of your information from hackers. Because of the number of transactions we process, we are required to follow these PCI compliance standards. These standards include a 12 step questionnaire about business practices as well as an entire network scan to ensure no vulnerability. Most sites out there are either not required to adhere to these standards due to their small volume or from the use of third party software. However, we guarantee the accuracy of our compliance and, more importantly, the safety of your personal and financial information.

We host and operate our website in-house and do not use third party hosting or networking services. This allows us to have full control over our website and makes your information more secure. Many companies will use a third party hosting company to store their website and your information where multiple people unaffiliated with the business may have access to your information.

## How Your Personal Information is Used by LovelySkin

LovelySkin collects personal information to make our services more rewarding and relevant for you to use.

We do not sell or solicit your name, email address or other personal information to Third Party Sites.

_Newsletters, Emails and Other LovelySkin Materials_  
We use email addresses and mailing addresses to send out newsletters, promotional offers, postcards and other messages with information about our latest products, gifts, sales and special features. After you create an account with us, you can choose not to receive these messages by opting-out of delivery.

## Children Under 13

We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. If you are under the age of 13, you can look at our website but cannot place an order. You also cannot create an account or participate in any of our services that ask for personal information. This policy is designed to protect children. Federal law requires us to take special steps to safeguard children's privacy.

## Social Media and Other Third Party Sites

We work with trusted third parties, including social network sites like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram and YouTube. All of these companies operate as Third Party Sites. We provide access to our Sites by third parties and business partners so we can generate interest in our products among members of your social networks and to allow you to share those interests with friends in your network.

The use of any features made available to you by a third party may result in information being collected or shared about you by us or by the third party. Information collected or shared through any such third party features is considered "public information" by us because the Third Party Sites made it publicly available. If you do not want us to be able to access information about you from Third Party Sites, you must instruct Third Party Sites not to share the information. We cannot control how your data is collected, stored, used or shared by Third Party Sites or to whom it is disclosed. Please be sure to review the privacy policies and privacy settings on your social networking sites to make sure you understand the information they are sharing. If you do not want a Third Party Site to share information about you, you must contact that site and determine whether it gives you the opportunity to opt out of sharing such information. LovelySkin is not responsible for how these third parties may use information collected from or about you. However, we do identify any areas on our Sites where third parties share information about you.

For example, we allow you to create an account using information from your Facebook account. We also allow you to use Facebook’s “like” feature while you’re on our site. Know that Facebook may collect that information and post it to your "News Feed" on Facebook and possibly to your Facebook profile's "Wall" and "Info" pages. Finally, by "liking" one of our products, you consent to the display of that information on our site. If you do not wish this to happen, you should not click that you "like" a product and you should review your privacy settings on Facebook (or similar Third Party Site). Note that we do not have to display someone's name, profile photo or other "public" Facebook profile information on our website even if that Facebook user "likes" one of our products. We reserve the right to remove the information of any person that we deem to be inconsistent with our ideals or otherwise inappropriate for public association with our company. These rules govern all of our interactions with Third Party Sites, including Twitter and Pinterest. We may remove from our site, at our sole discretion, any product offering or any photo or that does not comply with this policy.
