If you are a new customer, Global Personals will give you the choice (for example, once you have subscribed or signed up) whether or not you want us or other reputable companies to contact you about future offers, events and new services or related activities that you may find useful. Global Personals will not bombard you with emails, but Global Personals would like to keep you informed of any developments on the Website.
