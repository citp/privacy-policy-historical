PLYmedia Solutions Inc., including its direct and indirect subsidiaries and affiliates or parent companies and their platform and services (together the “Company”), their respective websites (the “Websites”) and the services and technologies they provide (each, the “Services”) have a strong commitment to protect the privacy of its users. Our privacy policy aims to ensure the protection of privacy of our users and to provide them with control over the decision how their information is being used.

#### What this Policy Covers

This Policy covers “end-users” or Internet users, as opposed to our clients or subscribers. Some of our Services enable advertisers to provide you with advertising that is relevant to your interests and therefore, more useful to you. This Policy explains how we treat your privacy, so you may decide whether to benefit from our Services, including how you may opt-out. This Policy does not cover the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to people that we do not employ or manage, including any cookies placed from outside our services. 

#### Information Collection and Cookies

To help companies personalize the advertising to enhance ad effectiveness and relevancy, improve our Services, create new products or services, conduct research, and provide reporting for internal and external clients, we are required to use standard tracking technologies, such as cookies, local shared objects, and pixel tags to collect information about the way in which users may respond to, select and interact with an ad or any content provided therein, analyze usage patterns and record your browsing activity. Cookies are little bits of text that are set and accessed from within a browser on your computer. They are accessed to collect and send statistical information when a user returns to a website or goes to another website. Local shared objects (also known as “LSOs” or “Flash cookies”) are used by the authors of files that are read by Adobe Flash Player and the websites hosting those files in a similar manner as cookies, but can also be used for a variety of purposes such as keeping track of information you provided and remembering your preferences. To learn how to reject or delete LSOs, click [here](http://www.adobe.com/privacy/flash-player.html) for the Adobe Flash Player privacy policy. Pixel tags (also known as “web beacons” or “clear GIFs”) are often used in combination with cookies, and is a type of technology placed on a website for the purpose of tracking activity. We only use these tracking technologies to better target and analyze consumer behavior with the goal of enabling our clients to provide better and more relevant advertising. We do not use them to alter your Internet experience, other than to show you a targeted ad. 

WE DO NOT USE COOKIES OR ANY OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES TO PROCESS OR COLLECT ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION ABOUT YOU. For purposes of this document, personally identifying information (PII) is information that personally identifies you and that is not otherwise publicly available, such as your first and last name, social security or identification number, credit card number, phone number, or email address. We use tracking technology for non-PII only, which is information that cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity, such as your computer’s configuration, and the version and type of browser you are using. While some non-PII could be used in conjunction with other information to personally identify a user (e.g., the address of a web page or of a computer on the Internet could identify a user when combined with Internet service provider records), we ourselves generally have no way of tying any of the information we collect back to a particular user, and in the unusual circumstance that we could use an Internet protocol address for such purposes, we do not do so unless required by law. In some situations, you may be directed to an ad that requests you to complete some additional information about yourself, including PII. Any such collection may be done by the website from which you visited or the advertiser and PLYmedia shall not be liable or responsible for any collection of such or any information. 

#### Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not rent or sell any information about you to others, or trade any such information. We may share aggregate information, and other non-PII information about you for various purposes, such as to perform or enhance our Services. We may also share any information (including to personally identify a user) with our affiliates or service providers, in response to any request by authorities that we believe legally compels us to respond, to establish or exercise legal rights or defend against legal claims, to investigate, prevent, or take action for violations of our terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law, or to transfer such information, subject to the terms of this Policy, if we were to acquire, or were acquired by or merged with, another company.
