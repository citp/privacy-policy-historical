### Important information about privacy and cookies

lovemoney.com ltd takes the issue of privacy very seriously and we are committed to protecting and respecting our users' privacy. This privacy and cookie statement sets out our current data processing practices. If you have any queries or concerns regarding these practices, you should contact us.

### The information we collect

  * **Registration:** When you register with lovemoney.com, we ask for your email address and we usually also capture your IP address at the time you register. We will also ask for additional information (such as your name, date of birth and financial data).
  * **Optional services:** On occasion, we may also ask you for other personal information in connection with surveys, sweepstakes or other promotional offers running on our site but your participation in these features is purely voluntary.
  * **Information automatically tracked:** While on our site, we automatically log certain information about how you're using our site. This information may include the URL that you just came from, your IP address and the pages you visit while on our site.
  * **Tracking information:** lovemoney.com ltd engages the services of third party analytics providers to track and analyse usage and volume statistical information from our users and visitors to our website.



We may also place a pixel on pages on our site, or those of our advertisers and partners. This enables us to record in our server logs that a specific user ID has visited a particular page. This data allows us to analyse and determine our audience's behavioural characteristics, which helps us to optimise our site, advertisement placement, and marketing focus.

### Use of cookies

If your browser is set up to accept them, we also use a feature known as a cookie. Cookies contain bits of information that websites transfer to your computer's hard drive for record keeping purposes.

Cookies can make the web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site such as ours.

At lovemoney.com, cookies are used the following ways:

  * to automatically access your previously stored account information and deliver more personalised services
  * to estimate our audience size and usage patterns.



Advertising networks that serve ads onto our site may also use cookies, but please note that we neither control nor have access to those cookies. These advertisers' uses of cookies are subject to their own privacy policies and not that of lovemoney.com.

Most browsers are set up to accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to refuse cookies or to notify you when you've received one.

### Where we store your information

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. lovemoney.com ltd will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data transferred outside of the EEA is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

### How we use the information we collect

  * Third party service providers: Our product comparison centres are for the most part powered by third party providers. In addition, we employ the services of third parties to aid us in certain aspects of our operations (such as the distribution of our email products or conducting a survey for us). Depending on the services performed, some of these providers may be provided with user information. These contractors would be subject to data protection and confidentiality agreements which limit their use and disclosure of all information they obtain through their relationship with lovemoney.com to lovemoney.com-related business only, consistent with this policy.

The same is true for any personal identifiable information (such as an email address) you include in any online comments.
  * Current or prospective advertisers/partners: We only provide aggregate, non-identifiable information to our current and prospective advertisers and business partners. For example, we might tell advertisers that we have 120,000 registered members in Metropolis, but we won't tell them that Superman is one of them, and we won't tell them that his email address is ckent@dailyplanet.com.
  * Legal requests: lovemoney.com ltd may disclose your personally identifiable information to protect the rights and property of lovemoney.com ltd as well as to comply with any applicable law or valid legal process. This includes, but is not limited to:

## Part 2: MoneyTrack

The following additional statements apply to information provided as part of our MoneyTrack service.

### Security of our MoneyTrack service: what you need to know

lovemoney.com ltd employs leading-edge technologies, standards, and business practices to protect your personal data. Key components of our security include:

  * Communications encryption
  * Extensive firewalls
  * Network intrusion detection systems
  * Physical security measures
  * Rigorous audits and inspections



In addition, we are partnered with Yodlee who store and manage account access details separately. Yodlee have multiple patents granted or filed on various aspects of our technology including security infrastructure and data acquisition framework.

### Browser communications encryption

lovemoney.com MoneyTrack employs SSL certificates with Extended Validation. This is currently the most secure certificate available. With this certificate more modern browsers are able to use 256-bit encryption and for older browsers it ensures that 128-bit encryption is possible. Click on the lock icon in your browser's status bar to learn more.

### Extensive firewalls

Access to our hosting infrastructure is protected by state of the art firewalls designed to prevent unauthorised access.

### Data

All your profile data is securely housed in an internet server hosting space that provides enhanced physical security, fire protection and electronic shielding.

Access details for online bank accounts are not stored alongside your lovemoney.com profile information, rather these are stored on our account aggregation partner Yodlee's infrastructure. This arrangement provides an added level of security as there is a clear separation of the storage of personal details and account details.

### Network intrusion detection systems

Network-based IDS (intrusion detection system) provides 24x7 network monitoring and alerts security personnel to any external attacks on the network.
