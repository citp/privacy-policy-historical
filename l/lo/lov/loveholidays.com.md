# Privacy Policy - loveholidays.com

#### loveholidays.com takes your privacy seriously

Loveholidays.com understands and respects the importance of your privacy and we are committed to safeguarding your personal information. 

Any personal information you provide to us including and similar to your name, address, telephone number and email address will not be released, sold, or rented to any entities or individuals outside of Loveholidays.com except where required by us to process your booking and to ensure that your travel arrangements run smoothly and meet your requirements. Our representatives may sometimes follow up, either by e-mail, phone, fax or mail, to people who have registered their details and we may periodically send promotional e-mail about new products, special offers or other information which we think you may find interesting using the e-mail address which you have provided. 

We take full responsibility for ensuring that proper security measures are in place to protect your information. We must pass the information on to the relevant suppliers of your travel arrangements such as your tour operator, airlines, hotels, transport companies etc. The information may also be provided to security or credit checking companies, public authorities such as customs/immigration if required by them, or as required by law. We may need to disclose our customer list including any personal information relating to you to a third party who acquires or attempts to acquire all or substantially all of the asset/ stock in our company or our website. 

Where your holiday is outside the European Economic Area (EEA), controls on data protection in your destination may not be as strong as the legal requirements in this country. We will not however, pass any information onto any person not responsible for part of your travel arrangements. This applies to any sensitive information that you give to us such as details of any disabilities, or dietary/religious requirements. (If we cannot pass this information to the relevant suppliers, whether in the EEA or not, we cannot provide your booking. In making this booking, you consent to this information being passed on to the relevant persons.)

Usually your tour operator or other principal will pass this information onto their suppliers once we have provided it to them. The tour operator or other principal's use of your information is subject to their policy, both in respect of your booking and any future marketing, and is their responsibility. Please ask either us or them for a copy of this if you would like to see it. 

#### CREDIT & DEBIT CARD DETAILS

All credit card information and personal information is encrypted as it is passed between your browser and our website. When you make a booking your initial payment is cleared using the information you provide. Your credit card number is not held in our database. All encryption is performed using at least 128 bits making it virtually impossible to decrypt without the necessary decryption key. 

#### MONITORING

**What are cookies?**

A "cookie" is a small data text file that is placed in your browser and allows loveholidays.com to recognise you each time you visit this site (customisation etc). Cookies themselves do not contain any personal information, and loveholidays.com does not use cookies to collect personal information. Cookies may also be used to pass information between websites owned by loveholidays.com. Cookies will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. 

Two types of cookies are used on this web site - session cookies, which are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the site, and persistent cookies, which remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). 

Cookies allow us to obtain information regarding users of our site which essentially helps us to provide you with a better user experience and tailor our services to your individual needs.

**Browser settings:** Most browsers have options that allow the visitor to control whether the browser will accept cookies, reject cookies, or notify the visitor each time a cookie is sent. You may elect to reject cookies by adjusting your browser's settings, but doing so will limit the range of features available to the visitor on our site and most other major websites that use cookies.

These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a website works. 

#### Category 3: Functionality Cookies 

These cookies are used to recognise you when you return to our website. This enables us to personalise our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region). 

#### Category 4: Targeting or Advertising Cookies
