<p>This privacy statement is valid for the mobile app LOVOO, the site
<a href="https://www.lovoo.com/imprint">www.lovoo.com</a>, and additional services
offered by LOVOO GmbH which refer to this privacy statement.</p>
<p>tl;dr: To summarize, your privacy is important to LOVOO. Thus, we only
use for full personal data for providing the LOVOO platform and product
optimization. We will never share sensitive data like your name profile
picture with third parties for advertising purposes. However, LOVOO is
partially financed by advertising. To be able to show you adverts that
are interesting to you we and/or our advertising partners use your
published age and gender, your coarse location and device and network
information to show you personalized adverts. We only share this data in
pseudonymous form. Pseudonymous means, that we will not share the data
together with your (user) name or your e-mail address or similar data,
just with the Advertiser-ID. All our advertising partners are
contractually and legally forbidden to join the transferred data with
your real name and similar data.</p>
<p>If you want to object against the use of this data for advertising
purposes, you can deactivate personalized advertising in the app setting
under Privacy and in your device settings. On an apple device this can
be done in the iOS preferences, under "Privacy" -- "Ads" and
enabling the option "no ad tracking"; for a user owning an Android
this can be achieved by opening the "Google Settings" (or first
"Settings" and then "Google"), clicking on "Display" and ticking
the option "Disable personalised ads. You can reset the IDFA or the
Advertising ID at any time with these options.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.lovoo.com/imprint">LOVOO GmbH</a>, Prager Straße
10, 01069 Dresden, Germany ("LOVOO GmbH" or "we/us/our") owns the
domain "<a href="http://www.lovoo.com&quot;">www.lovoo.com"</a> and all of its sub-pages ("LOVOO domain")
where it provides mobile app LOVOO ("LOVOO app") available for
download for various operating systems which is its principal means of
running a platform for chatting with, getting to know and meeting other
people ("LOVOO"). LOVOO GmbH is the data controller.</p>
<p>The service offering is based on the freemium model allowing a LOVOO
user ("user" or "you") to use the LOVOO domain or run the LOVOO app
to create a profile ("user profile"), upload images and exchange news
etc. with other interested users and their user profiles for free. Users
have access to various functions such as Chat, Live Radar, Match Game or
Live-Video and many other LOVOO functions. Added to that, LOVOO offers a
chargeable premium service for users who wish to gain access to further
unique functions.</p>
<p>LOVOO's offering also lets you meet real people in your area and
therefore classifies as a so-called dating service. Everybody aged 16 or
older may register.</p>
<p>Collecting, processing and using your data is based on the provisions of
the Federal Telemedia Act (TMG) and the data privacy laws, the latter
particularly including the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and as of
25 May 2018 -- the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>This privacy statement explains how we will handle your personal data.
Personal data is discrete information about private or objective
conditions of a specific or identifiable natural person. Personal data
includes, but is not limited to a person's name, birthday, phone number
or the e-mail address and usage data such as the IP address. Another
purpose of the privacy statement is to inform users about the data
collected, saved and processed and how LOVOO GmbH ensures the protection
and safety of personal data.</p>
<p>LOVOO GmbH does not insist on the use of real names. Users may specify a
nickname instead of their real name. For some parts of LOVOO, e.g. if
you receive money from LOVOO, you may be required to provide us with
your name, your address and your citizenship for tax purposes. In this
case we will inform you about this.</p>
<p>This privacy statement breaks down into the following sections:</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="1-1-lovoo-app-download">1.1. LOVOO app download</h3>
<p>When you download the LOVOO app, the relevant data will be transferred
to the app store operator concerned. Depending on the app store, the set
of data may include the app store user's e-mail address or customer
number, the time of download and a unique device ID, for example.
However, LOVOO GmbH has no influence on and is not controller for this
data processing. The privacy statements / settings of the relevant app
store operator apply.</p>
<h3 id="1-2-installation-and-access-rights">1.2. Installation and access rights</h3>
<p>LOVOO needs various access pathways and data to ensure the technical
operability of the LOVOO app and to provide the services you can run
using the LOVOO app.</p>
<p>Depending on which operating system you use, the installer may already
ask your permission to access specific functions and pieces of
information. Such access rights cover the location, messages, mobile
data and others.</p>
<p>The user preferences of some terminal devices allow user to manually
withdraw some of these rights. If you do, please bear in mind that not
granting these rights may render the LOVOO app partly or completely
useless. Access rights will be checked before or after the installation,
depending on your app version.</p>
<h2 id="2-how-does-lovoo-collect-process-and-use-my-data-if-i-just-visit-the-lovoo-domain-or-the-lovoo-app-but-do-not-create-a-user-profile-">2. How does LOVOO collect, process and use my data if I just visit the LOVOO domain or the LOVOO app but do not create a user profile?</h2>

profile.</p>
<p>The set of data contains:</p>

<li><p>IP address</p>
</li>
<li><p>name of requested website, file, date and time of request</p>
</li>
<li><p>data volume transferred</p>

For this purpose, we store the full data for up to 90 days.</p>
<p>Collecting, processing and using the location data is necessary for the
user to run the so-called "location-based service" which provides
registered users with suggestions tailored to the user's location.
Sections 3.3 and 4.3 further explain the location data.</p>
<p>LOVOO also uses cookies (see section 5.1), analysis services and
tracking providers (see section 5.2).</p>
<h2 id="3-how-does-lovoo-collect-process-and-use-my-data-when-i-use-the-functions-of-the-lovoo-app-or-the-lovoo-domain-after-creating-a-user-profile-">3. How does LOVOO collect, process and use my data when I use the functions of the LOVOO app or the LOVOO domain after creating a user profile?</h2>
<p>Unless the user explicitly consents, LOVOO GmbH uses the personal data
disclosed by the user or generated when using LOVOO after creating a
user profile solely for performance of the contractual relationship and
as is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by
LOVOO GmbH use as described in this privacy statement. Proper use of
LOVOO to the full extent requires the user to create a user profile.
This involves entering further personal data which LOVOO GmbH uses to
provide the service agreed.</p>
<h3 id="3-1-mandatory-entries-for-creating-a-user-profile">3.1 Mandatory entries for creating a user profile</h3>
<p>You must enter the following details to register and create a user
profile:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>email address</p>
</li>
<li><p>password</p>
</li>
<li><p>user name (nickname)</p>
</li>
<li><p>town</p>
</li>
<li><p>date of birth</p>
</li>
<li><p>sex</p>
</li>
<li><p>profile picture</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We collect, process and use the data you enter so that you can use
LOVOO. Among other things it helps us address and authenticate you,
verify your age, personalise your profile, display matching user
profiles and (in pseudonymous form) to show you ads (see section 4).</p>
<p>We delete this data when you delete your account. The legal basis for
this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) b) of the EU General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<h3 id="3-2-optional-details">3.2 Optional details</h3>
<p>You may add many optional details to your user profile or enter search parameters. They
particularly help LOVOO to select other user profiles by various
criteria, suggest them to the user and display them in LOVOO. Additional
details increase the probability of getting in touch with matching user
profiles. However, these details are entirely optional, and the user can
see, enter, modify or delete them in the Details section of the profile,</p>
<p>We collect, save and use the data you enter so that you can use LOVOO.</p>
<p>Whereas these optional details are visible as "public" information to
other logged-in LOVOO users, the user owning the affected user profile
can modify or delete them at any time via the Preferences section of the
profile. This data may also be used for ads (see section 4 for information about
advertising).</p>
<p>We delete this data when you delete your account. The legal basis for
this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) b) of the EU General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<h3 id="3-3-location-data">3.3 Location data</h3>
<p>LOVOO's offering includes so-called location-based services which
display specific choices tailored to the user's location. A user can
therefore be shown other users in the vicinity. To be able to provide
these functions within the LOVOO app, LOVOO collects location data by
means of GPS of the terminal device concerned as well as location data
of nearby radio access nodes. Provided that the site survey is enabled,
and permission is granted, the location will be periodically transferred
to LOVOO GmbH and will be respectively processed and used.</p>
<p>Before collection of location data, users must allow the collection of
location data. The location data is then processed in accordance with
this privacy statement. If activated and granted, the location data is
transferred to LOVOO GmbH at regular intervals to be processed and used.</p>
<p>Users can change this functionality at any time by displaying the
Preferences of their terminal device's operating system at any time to
either allow or disallow the collecting of location data.</p>
<p>Location data will also be used for advertising purposes, if the user
has not objected to this in the app settings. (See section 4 for
information about advertising).</p>
<p>We store this data for up to 14 days. The legal basis for this
processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) b) or f) of the EU General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<h3 id="3-4-ip-addresses">3.4 IP addresses</h3>
<p>We keep the users' IP addresses for safety and checking purposes. The
aim is to prevent abuse of the service. This data is used to prevent and
fight fake-profiles, illegal activity and spam and to secure the
integrity and stability of the LOVOO platform. For this purpose, we
store the full data up to 90 days. The legal basis for this processing
of personal data is Article 6 (1) f) of the EU General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>For technical reasons the IP address will be transferred to advertising
partner, see below. LOVOO GmbH has selected its advertising partners
with due diligence to ensure that your privacy is protected by
contractual restrictions and the law.</p>
<h3 id="3-4-payment-data">3.4 Payment data</h3>
<p>External payment service providers handle the transactions involved when
a user does any In-App purchases via LOVOO, buys credits or subscribes
to our chargeable premium service. LOVOO GmbH neither collects nor
processes any payment data of shopping transactions. Instead, the
payment service providers take care of entering and processing the
payment data directly. All that LOVOO GmbH and the payment service
providers do is to exchange technical data (e.g. the transaction ID) in
order to validate the purchases. We save this data until your user
account is deleted or beyond this point, until a time when the data is
no longer subject to any tax-related, commercial or other statutory
storage obligations. The legal basis for this processing of personal
data is Article 6 (1) b) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR).</p>
<h2 id="4-how-does-lovoo-use-my-data-for-advertising-">4. How does LOVOO use my data for advertising?</h2>
<p>LOVOO GmbH decided to run LOVOO as a freemium service which lets every
user obtain a basic LOVOO version free of charge. Users of the free
version will be shown ads. The ads shown in LOVOO contain our own
advertising matters (such as the premium products of LOVOO) or content
ordered by an advertising firm in so-called campaigns. Campaigns may be
personalised to tailor them to specific user groups (e.g., ads for
cosmetic products just for female or male users; skateboard ads only for
persons under 25, etc.). Some ads shown in LOVOO are mediated by
external service providers.</p>
<h3 id="4-1-which-data-is-used-for-advertising-and-who-is-it-given-to-">4.1. Which data is used for advertising and who is it given to?</h3>
<p>LOVOO GmbH can use LOVOO to show third-party ads which may be tailored
to the users' assumed specific interests (personalised ads) or targeted
to certain user groups grouped by age, location or gender. The users can
object to the use of its data in the privacy settings of the app. We and
our advertising partners will only use non-sensitive data, that the you
have published on LOVOO and information about your device and your
connection. Under no circumstances will we share your name, your e-mail
address, your profile picture or your exact location or similar data
that allows a direct inference of your real person with our advertising
partners.</p>
<p>Whenever such personalised ads are shown, the third-party provider whose
ad is shown in LOVOO or whose services are used to show ads of other
third parties the following pseudonymous data may be transferred
("<strong>forwarded data</strong>"):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>advertiser ID</p>
</li>
<li><p>your published age and gender</p>
</li>
<li><p>your coarse location</p>
</li>
<li><p>technical data of the terminal device</p>
</li>
<li><p>LOVOO usage data</p>
</li>
<li><p>data of ads shown</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Forwarded data is disclosed to the following categories of recipients
for the purposes explained:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ad server services operators</p>
</li>
<li><p>tracking services operators</p>
</li>
<li><p>affiliate networks</p>
</li>
<li><p>customer relationship services operators</p>
</li>
<li><p>other sales &amp; marketing partners</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You can object to this processing at any time by going to the privacysettings of the LOVOO app and. You can also reset your Advertising ID in
your device settings. In that case a new Advertising ID is created which
will not be joined with older data. With this you can ensure, that you
will not see any ads based on the forwarded data before you have
objected to the transfer.</strong></p>
<p>All our partners are obligated to process forwarded data only on
accordance with the high data protection principles of the European
Union and only for advertising purposes. This means, that all partners
are obligated no not identify the real user / or remove the Pseudonymity
of the data.</p>
<p>The recipients of forwarded data are sometimes seated outside of the
European Union. LOVOO GmbH transfers forwarded data only to third
countries, if the data protection level of the third country is adequate
or the recipients has provided appropriate safeguards.</p>
<p>Forwarded data is transferred to the following countries:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>USA (EU-US-Privacy-Shield and EU Standard Contract Clause)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Israel (Adequacy decision of the European Union)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Privacy Shield treaty, the Adequacy decision and the EU Standard
Contract Clause can be reviewed at the website of the EU commission

<h3 id="4-2-what-is-an-advertiser-id-and-how-is-it-used-">4.2. What is an advertiser ID and how is it used?</h3>
<p>For tracking and advertising, the LOVOO app uses the so-called
advertiser ID, i.e. the "Advertiser Identifier" (IDFA) for offerings
of Apple Inc. and the "Android Advertiser ID" (advertiser ID) for
offerings of Google. Inc. (jointly the "<strong>advertiser ID(s)</strong>"). These
advertiser IDs are unique non-permanent numbers identifying a specific
terminal device. They are provided by iOS for offerings of Apple Inc. or
by Android for offerings of Google Inc. As opposed to vendor advertiser
IDs (generated by latest-generation operating systems and identical for
the apps of just one provider), the advertiser ID is the same as the one
transferred to other companies when running their apps. The user can
deactivate the generation of the Advertiser-ID. On an apple device this
can be done in the iOS preferences, under "Privacy" -- "Ads" by
enabling the option "no ad tracking"; for a user owning an Android
this can be achieved by opening the "Google Settings" (or first
"Settings" and then "Google"), clicking on "Display" and ticking
the option "Disable personalised ads. The Advertiser ID is pseudonymous
and LOVOO GmbH will not be joined with other user data to identify him
for advertising purposes.</p>
<p>The Advertiser ID will be used by LOVOO GmbH and our advertising partner
as described above to show you personalized advertising and to analyse
this advertising. You can always object to this pseudonymous use by
disabling the Advertiser ID as described above or objecting in the
privacy settings of our app.</p>

<h3 id="4-3-using-location-data">4.3. Using location data</h3>
<p>Apart from collecting the location data by running GPS Location (see
section 3.3) to enable the location-based services, LOVOO GmbH collects
and uses other location data to show the user ads in LOVOO tailored to
the user's location and profile. LOVOO GmbH will never forward the
exact location to our advertising partners. To protect your privacy all
provided location data is coarse by around 2 km. To our knowledge with
this data the identification of an individual is not or only with an
unreasonable and illegal measures possible.</p>
<p><strong>For users that are sensitive to privacy question, we offer a separate
option in the apps privacy settings to object of the use of location
data for the future.</strong></p>
<h3 id="4-4-legal-basis-for-the-use-of-personal-data-for-advertising-purposes">4.4 legal basis for the use of personal data for advertising purposes</h3>
<p>LOVOO GmbH bases the processing of sharing of the above data on the
performance of the contract with you (Article 6 (1) b) GDPR in
connection with Nr. 11.2. of our Terms of Service) and the legitimate
interests pursued by us (Article 6 (1) f) GDPR).</p>
<p>We offer our users a service under the Freemium model, which means, that
certain parts of LOVOO are free to use. In Exchange for using the LOVOO
platform without charge, LOVOO GmbH displays personalized advertisings
and process and shares pseudonymous data as specified above.</p>
<p>Pre-requirement for all data transfer is that the recipient ensures by
contractual, legal, technical and organizational measure that the data
processing is always in compliance with privacy law.</p>
<p>We have decided to only share data, which -- even in the event of an
unlawful disclosure or by hacking of our partners -- is not sensitive
for individual users. We thus only share data in pseudonymous form and
only data that the user has made public or is -- by its nature -- not
sensitive like device and network data.</p>

comfortable experience. Cookies are small text files temporarily stored
locally by the Internet browser (so-called session cookies) or on the
hard disk of either the mobile device or the computer (so-called
permanent cookies). You can set your browser application to refusing to
accept cookies or to asking you before a cookie is accepted. If cookies

details see section 5.2 Tracking and analysis services providers) upload
cookies to a user's device in order to capture that user's usage data.

<h3 id="5-2-tracking-analysis-service-and-security-providers">5.2 Tracking, analysis service and security providers</h3>
<p>By analysing what its visitors do, LOVOO optimises its services and how
they are offered. To this end, LOVOO GmbH deploys methods able to
analyse visits to the LOVOO domain or the LOVOO app. We also use
tracking tools provided by third parties in order to analyse the reach
of various advertising and marketing campaigns. Running third-party
tools may involve the transfer of personal data.</p>
<p>While data processing mainly helps to troubleshoot LOVOO, it is also
important for optimising LOVOO and adapting it to its users' needs. Web
analysis provides further details which are useful for LOVOO GmbH to
obtain key facts about the number of visitors and how they distribute
over time, about favourite content and the time users spend on our site.
It may sometimes be possible or necessary to verify whether a user
profile was created in response to a specific promotional activity. The
data is further used for fraud and spam prevention. To actually analyse
the user data, it is transferred to various third-party providers.</p>
<p>LOVOO currently uses the following analysis and tracking services
providers:</p>
<p><strong>Crashlytics (Fabric)</strong></p>
<p>The LOVOO app runs the analysis tool "Crashlytics" (Fabric) supplied
by Crashlytics, 1 Kendall Square, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
("<strong>Crashlytics</strong>"). This analysis utility uses the users' IP
addresses albeit always after making them anonymous. It is therefore
impossible to trade an address back to a real person. Crashlytics
provides LOVOO GmbH with real-time analyses of system crashes which is a
great help in maintaining and improving the LOVOO app or LOVOO domain.
Details transferred are one user ID, the clicks as well as technical
device data needed to analyse the error.</p>
<p>For further data protection details, read the privacy policy of
Crashlytics:
<a href="http://try.crashlytics.com/terms/">http://try.crashlytics.com/terms/</a></p>
<p>The main purpose of tracking and the analysis of user behaviour that
this entails is to fulfil our contractual obligations, especially to
reduce crashes, bugs and to improve our product. The legal basis for
this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) b) of the EU General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
<p>LOVOO runs "<strong>Google Analytics</strong>" supplied by Google Inc., 1600
Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("<strong>Google</strong>").
LOVOO GmbH wishes to make you aware of the fact that, in LOVOO, Google
Analytics has been extended by IP masking function
"_gat._anonymizeIp" which ensures that IP addresses are made
anonymous first.</p>
<p><em>Please note the following details regarding the use of Google
Analytics:</em></p>
<p>Google Analytics uses cookies to enable the analysis of how LOVOO is
used. As a rule, the cookie transfers the details of how you use LOVOO
to a Google server in the US and stores them there. First of all, and
provided that IP anonymisation is enabled, however, Google shortens your
IP address used within the EU Member States or within other members of
the Treaty on the European Economic Area. In the name of LOVOO GmbH,
Google will use these details to analyse how you use our service, to
compile activity reports and to provide the operator with other services
linked to your use of LOVOO.</p>
<p>We only use Google Analytics with the user's consent, by allowing us to
set the necessary cookies. We save this data for 26 months. The legal
basis for this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) a) of the EU
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p><strong>Adjust</strong></p>
<p>LOVOO uses "adjust", an app usage analysis tool supplied by adjust
GmbH, Saarbrücker Str. 37 a in 10405 Berlin, Germany. When installing
the LOVOO app, adjust will save installation and event data of your iOS
or Android app. This helps us understand how our users are interacting
with the LOVOO app. It also allows us to analyse and improve our mobile
advertising campaigns. Analysis by adjust is based on the IDFA or the
Advertiser ID as well as your anonymous IP and MAC address. This
unilaterally anonymous data disallows to identify you or your mobile
device. In case you wish to disable tracking by adjust, please go to
<a href="http://www.adjust.com/opt-out">www.adjust.com/opt-out</a>.</p>
<p>The legal basis for this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) f)
of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<h3 id="5-3-social-media-links">5.3 Social media links</h3>
<p>The LOVOO domain contains links to LOVOO GmbH accounts with the
following social networks: Instagram, YouTube, Pinterest, Twitter,
Facebook and Google+. After clicking on the embedded picture, you will
be taken to the associated Instagram, YouTube, Pinterest, Twitter,
Facebook or Google+ page. That is to say that user data will not be
transferred to the provider until you click on a link. The legal basis
for this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) a) of the EU
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>Provided that you and your user profile are logged in to the social
destination network at the time, your click on the button will be
associated with your visit to LOVOO.</p>
<p>If you do not wish the social media to collect data via the LOVOO
domain, we recommend that you log off your social network before you
visit the LOVOO domain. But even so, one or several cookies with an ID
will be uploaded when you click on the button and run LOVOO. This
function may therefore collect data and create a profile which may then
be traced back to a specific natural person. If you do not wish this to
happen, just visit the LOVOO domain and click on the correct option to
disable the function. Or you can set your browser to never accepting any
cookies; please note that this may restrict the functionality of LOVOO.</p>

your user data to log in if not logged in yet. A single click then links
your Facebook profile to your LOVOO user profile. This link then
automatically provides LOVOO GmbH with your Facebook data, i.e. your
e-mail address and other details stored with your public Facebook
profile. Your public Facebook profile shows all data you have made
publicly known via Facebook. A public Facebook profile normally consists
of the following details: your name, profile picture, sex, language,
country, age bracket, Facebook ID, friends, likes and your relationship
status.</p>

<p>Personal data is used as described below used to prevent and fight
fake-profiles, illegal activity and spam and to secure the integrity and
stability of the LOVOO platform.</p>
<ul>
<li>IP and email addresses are saved to detect spam &amp; scam for as long
as the user is active.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><p>Messages are automatically checked for specific keywords but not
saved for this purpose.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Personal data such as an active user's sex, age and location is
saved and pooled with other non-personal data in order to detect any
abnormalities.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Whereas previous phone numbers are saved to check suspicious
profiles sent by SMS, such phone numbers cannot be associated with
the verified user.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Google reCaptcha</strong></p>
<p>We use Google's reCaptcha service to protect the LOVOO platform. The
reCaptcha is used to detect if the Input has been made by a human or by
fraudulent, automated machines. For this purpose, your IP address and
other data required by the Google Service is transferred to Google.</p>
<p>For this service Google's privacy statement applies:
<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>CloudFlare</strong></p>
<p>LOVOO GmbH uses technology of CloudFlare Inc, Inc 665 3rd St. 200, San
Francisco, CA 94107, USA to protect the LOVOO platform and increase the
security and stability of the platform. For this purpose, CloudFlare
and/or LOVOO will -- among others - set cookies on your device, analyse
your device and network data to detect and differentiate legitimate
LOVOO users from hackers, SPAM, etc. Cloudflare processes this data only
on behalf of LOVOO and not for their own purpose. Additional information
for this can be found at: <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/security-policy">https://www.cloudflare.com/security-policy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Legal basis</strong></p>
<p>The legal basis for this processing is Article 6 (1) f) of the EU
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). LOVOO GmbH has a legitimate
interest in keeping the LOVOO platform stable and free of SPAM, illegal
activity and fake-profiles.</p>
<h2 id="8-how-is-data-deleted-and-back-ups-created-">8. How is data deleted and back-ups created?</h2>
<p>Deleting a user profile (attention: not by deleting the LOVOO app!) or
notifying us accordingly deletes all of that user's data. Apart from
that, users can remove profile details themselves or ask us to do so at
any time.</p>
<p>Exempt of such a deletion is data, that we have to retain by statutory
storage obligations, for winding up the contract and for performance of
contract with other users. For example, we will not promptly delete the
following data:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Payment data and data regarding reward claims, which we have to retain
for tax-related, commercial or other statutory storage obligations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Data, which you have shared with other users in chats, like messages
or pictures (see below)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When do we delete data, that you have shared with other users?</strong></p>
<p>We delete data which is accessible in your public profile, like profile
pictures, stream pictures and profile data, promptly as specified above.</p>
<p>We can't delete data that you have shared non-publicly with other users
without infringing the rights of this other user. Thus, we can delete
chat data only after both users have delete their profile.</p>
<p><strong>How long will it take to delete the data?</strong></p>
<p>Such details will be immediately removed from the productive databases
and, thus from the LOVOO interface; however, it may take up to 14 days
until the data is removed from all of LOVOO's server layers, cache
memories and back-up databases.</p>
<p>If deletion is not possible, we will anonymize the data or restrict the
processing.</p>
<p><strong>In case certain facts lead to the suspicion that a user profile uses
LOVOO illegally or contrary to the contract with us, we reserve the
right to check and perhaps save profile files before deleting them. This
is to protect the users of LOVOO GmbH's offerings.</strong></p>
<p>Irrespective of data deleted because of user-deleted profiles, LOVOO
automatically and periodically deletes historical data no longer needed
to perform the contract (e.g. historical location details and IP data).</p>
<p>In order to protect its datasets, LOVOO GmbH creates so-called back-up
copies which are overwritten and, thus, deleted for good after 14 days.
Deletion also affects log files that may be contained in these back-ups.
Log files will also be deleted when a user profile is completely
deleted.</p>
<h2 id="9-how-does-lovoo-ensure-data-integrity-">9. How does LOVOO ensure data integrity?</h2>
<p>The trust of its users and protecting their data is of great importance
to LOVOO GmbH. To prevent unauthorised access to or disclosure of user
data and to ensure the integrity and appropriate use of the data, LOVOO
GmbH has appropriate physical, technical and administrative procedures
in place to protect the information collected by LOVOO GmbH.</p>
<p>To provide highest-level protection of the user data, the offerings of
the LOVOO domain or LOVOO app rely on a secure SSL connection that
allows the transfer of nothing but encrypted data.</p>
