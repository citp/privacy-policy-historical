# Privacy Policy

The coloured text on the right-hand side of each paragraph provides a short explanation of our Privacy Policy. Hopefully you will find the summaries helpful, but it is important that you find the time to read the Privacy Policy in full. 

## Introduction

We are founded on the principle of ensuring that our customers enjoy the experience of shopping with us. We know that you may be concerned about the privacy of information you share with us. We take the privacy and security of your personal details very seriously and are committed to protecting them. Here we outline our Privacy Policy, which sets out how we handle the information we collect about you when you visit our website and use our services. 

This Privacy Policy was last updated on 1 February 2016. This is the privacy policy for Lovecrafts Collective Limited, incorporated and registered in England and Wales (Company No. 07193527), whose registered office is at 6th Floor Corinthian House, 279 Tottenham Court Road, London, W1T 7RJ, trading via its subsidiaries as loveknitting.com and lovecrochet.com (“Lovecrafts”, “we”, “us”) and who is the data controller for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998. We are committed to protecting and respecting the privacy rights of our online visitors (“you”). 

This Privacy Policy sets out how we will process any information we collect about you or that you provide to us when you access or use our websites or other online or mobile services or applications (“Services”). Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal information. Your personal information will not be used or disclosed for purposes other than as set out in this Privacy Policy or which are not permitted under applicable law. This Privacy Policy applies to personal information we hold about individuals, not to information we hold about companies and other organisations. 

## Changes to our Privacy Policy

Our privacy policy may change at any time. The latest version is not the last.

We may change this Privacy Policy at any time, including whenever the functionality of our website requires it be updated. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the “last updated” date above and, in some cases, we may provide you with more prominent notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to check back regularly to review this page so that you will always know what information we collect, how we use it, and to whom we disclose it. 

## Information we may collect from you

We collect your order and registration data. Our servers may also collect log and traffic data.

This Privacy Policy applies to any information that you provide to us when using our Services or which we may collect from you automatically, including if you create a member account, subscribe to any of our Services, order any of our products, or upload or submit any material via our websites.

  * To fulfil you order, answer any queries or requests you may have, and carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us. 
  * To identify you when you make contact with us.

## Cookies

We use cookies to personalise your experience with us and improve our Services. They are also used to collect statistical data. 

In order to provide certain of the Services we use “cookies”. These are small text files that a website transfers to your browser for added functionality or for tracking your usage of the website.  Cookies help us to improve our websites and to deliver a better and more personalised service.

For example, we use “session cookies” when you add products to your basket, and also to obtain statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and patterns. These are saved to the browser only and disappear when the browser is closed.  We also use “permanent cookies” to remember if you have visited us before; these will stay on your computer after you leave our website.

On most browsers you can refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies or by clearing your cookies. The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to disable cookies altogether, prevent the addition of new cookies or have a notification sent to you when you receive a new cookie. However, if you disable your cookies, your use of our website or Services may be adversely affected.
