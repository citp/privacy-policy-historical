# LoveIt

Love It, LLC (“LoveIt”) is committed to protecting the privacy of your information. This Privacy Policy describes LoveIt’s information practices with respect to [www.loveit.com](http://www.loveit.com/) (“Site”), LoveIt’s application for mobile devices (“Application”) and the services available on the Site or via the Application (“Services”). This Privacy Policy is subject to the Terms of Service posted on the Site and the Application. By using the Site, Application and/or Services, you expressly consent to LoveIt’s collection, storage, use and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. 

### INFORMATION COLLECTED

Automatic Collection:   LoveIt uses common Internet technologies such as cookies and Web beacons to keep track of users’ interactions with the Site, Application and Services and to improve the quality of its service.  LoveIt may also collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address to track and aggregate non-personally identifiable information, your referring website addresses, browser type, domain name and access times. 

  * Cookie:   When you visit the Site, the Application and/or use a Service, LoveIt’s servers send a cookie (a small file with a string of characters) to your computer.  Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you but would recognize your web browser; unless you choose to identify yourself to LoveIt (through an account or otherwise), you will remain anonymous to LoveIt.  A cookie can be either session based (assigned to you each time you sign in) or persistent (it identifies browsers that have previously visited the Site, the Application or utilized the Services). Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can disable your web browser’s ability to accept cookies; however, if you do so, certain Site, Application or Service features may not work. 
  * Web Beacon:   A web beacon is an electronic image on a web page that recognizes certain types of information on your computer when you visit that particular web page. 
  * IP Address: an Internet Protocol Address is a numerical label that is assigned to each computer on the Internet. 
  * Referring website address: a referring website address identifies the address of the webpage you were on previously. 
  * Browser: A browser is a software application used for retrieving, presenting, and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web. 



In addition, LoveIt may use third parties to track and analyze usage information, and in so doing may use third party cookies. Please see more detailed information below under “Third Parties” if you would like to know more about third party cookies.

  * Voluntary Collection:  LoveIt may collect certain information that personally identifies you (“PI”) or is protected personal information (“PPI”), such as your name, email address, website and login information for third party services (collectively referred to herein as “personally identifiable information”),  if you choose to share such information.  For example, this information may be requested as part of member registration, whereby we will create an account for your use of the Site and/or Application based on the PI you provide and you will become a member of LoveIt.  The decision to provide this information is optional; however, if you elect not to register or provide the requested information, you may not be able to access certain content or features or participate in certain areas of the Site or the Application.
  * Third Party Social Networking Sites:  You can register to join LoveIt via the Site or Application or by logging into your account with certain third party social networking sites (“SNS”) (including, but not limited to, Facebook and Twitter) via our Site.  If you decide to create your account by logging into a SNS via the Site, we will extract the PI you have provided to the SNS (such as your “real” name, email address and other information you make publicly available via the SNS) from the account you have with such SNS and use that information to create your membership account; the information we extract may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS.  For example, our Services allow users to create an account and login to the Services using their Facebook account credentials through Facebook Connect.  If you are not currently registered as a Member and you click on “Sign in Using Facebook,” you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register and join LoveIt. By using Facebook Connect, you are allowing LoveIt to access your Facebook account information and you are agreeing to the Facebook Terms of Use regarding your use of the Services via Facebook.
  * Publicly Posted:  Information that you post on or through any public areas on the Site or the Application (or elsewhere on the Internet) may be collected and used by anyone and may result in unsolicited messages or other contact from others.
