If you want to object against the use of this data for advertising purposes, you can deactivate personalized advertising in the app setting under Privacy and in your device settings. On an apple device this can be done in the iOS preferences, under "Privacy" -- "Ads" and enabling the option "no ad tracking"; for a user owning an Android this can be achieved by opening the "Google Settings" (or first "Settings" and then "Google"), clicking on "Display" and ticking the option "Disable personalised ads.

**Introduction**

[LOVOO GmbH](https://www.lovoo.com/imprint), Prager Straße 10, 01069 Dresden, Germany ("LOVOO GmbH" or "we/us/our") owns the domain "[www.lovoo.com"](http://www.lovoo.com%22/) and all of its sub-pages ("LOVOO domain") where it provides mobile app LOVOO ("LOVOO app") available for download for various operating systems which is its principal means of running a platform for chatting with, getting to know and meeting other people ("LOVOO"). LOVOO GmbH is the data controller.

The service offering is based on the freemium model allowing a LOVOO user ("user" or "you") to use the LOVOO domain or run the LOVOO app to create a profile ("user profile"), upload images and exchange news etc. with other interested users and their user profiles for free. Users have access to various functions such as Chat, Live Radar, Match Game or Live-Video and many other LOVOO functions. Added to that, LOVOO offers a chargeable premium service for users who wish to gain access to further unique functions.

LOVOO's offering also lets you meet real people in your area and therefore classifies as a so-called dating service. Everybody aged 16 or older may register.

Collecting, processing and using your data is based on the provisions of the Federal Telemedia Act (TMG) and the data privacy laws, the latter particularly including the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and as of 25 May 2018 -- the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

This privacy statement explains how we will handle your personal data. Personal data is discrete information about private or objective conditions of a specific or identifiable natural person. Personal data includes, but is not limited to a person's name, birthday, phone number or the e-mail address and usage data such as the IP address. Another purpose of the privacy statement is to inform users about the data collected, saved and processed and how LOVOO GmbH ensures the protection and safety of personal data.

LOVOO GmbH does not insist on the use of real names. Users may specify a nickname instead of their real name. For some parts of LOVOO, e.g. if you receive money from LOVOO, you may be required to provide us with your name, your address and your citizenship for tax purposes. In this case we will inform you about this.

## 1\. How is my data collected, processed and used when I download the LOVOO app?

* * *

### 1.1. LOVOO app download

When you download the LOVOO app, the relevant data will be transferred to the app store operator concerned. Depending on the app store, the set of data may include the app store user's e-mail address or customer number, the time of download and a unique device ID, for example. However, LOVOO GmbH has no influence on and is not controller for this data processing. The privacy statements / settings of the relevant app store operator apply.

### 1.2. Installation and access rights

LOVOO needs various access pathways and data to ensure the technical operability of the LOVOO app and to provide the services you can run using the LOVOO app.

Depending on which operating system you use, the installer may already ask your permission to access specific functions and pieces of information. Such access rights cover the location, messages, mobile data and others.

The user preferences of some terminal devices allow user to manually withdraw some of these rights. If you do, please bear in mind that not granting these rights may render the LOVOO app partly or completely useless. Access rights will be checked before or after the installation, depending on your app version.

## 2\. How does LOVOO collect, process and use my data if I just visit the LOVOO domain or the LOVOO app but do not create a user profile?

Unless the user explicitly consents, LOVOO GmbH uses the personal data disclosed by the user or generated when using LOVOO without creating a user profile solely for performance of the contractual relationship and as is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by LOVOO GmbH use as described in this privacy statement.

Except for the data listed below, LOVOO does not collect any personal data if you simply visit the LOVOO domain (starting on a so-called landing or home page) or install the LOVOO app without creating a user profile.

The set of data contains:

  * IP address

  * name of requested website, file, date and time of request

  * data volume transferred

  * browser type and version

  * referrer URL (source URL) from which the user opened the page - requesting provider plus, the data below transferred by the user's terminal device if the user just installs the LOVOO app but neither registers nor creates a user profile:

  * push handle (for sending push messages)

  * location data (GPS location)

  * country code

  * language

  * device name

  * name and version of operating system.




This data is required to use the LOVOO domain or to install the LOVOO app as such or they are used for analysis for statistical purposes in order to optimise LOVOO. This data is used to prevent and fight fake-profiles, illegal activity and spam and to secure the integrity and stability of the LOVOO platform. For this purpose, we store the full data for up to 90 days.

Collecting, processing and using the location data is necessary for the user to run the so-called "location-based service" which provides registered users with suggestions tailored to the user's location. Sections 3.3 and 4.3 further explain the location data.

LOVOO also uses cookies (see section 5.1), analysis services and tracking providers (see section 5.2).

## 3\. How does LOVOO collect, process and use my data when I use the functions of the LOVOO app or the LOVOO domain after creating a user profile?

Unless the user explicitly consents, LOVOO GmbH uses the personal data disclosed by the user or generated when using LOVOO after creating a user profile solely for performance of the contractual relationship and as is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by LOVOO GmbH use as described in this privacy statement. Proper use of LOVOO to the full extent requires the user to create a user profile. This involves entering further personal data which LOVOO GmbH uses to provide the service agreed.

### 3.1 Mandatory entries for creating a user profile

You must enter the following details to register and create a user profile:

  * email address

  * password

  * user name (nickname)

  * town

  * date of birth

  * sex

  * profile picture




We collect, process and use the data you enter so that you can use LOVOO. Among other things it helps us address and authenticate you, verify your age, personalise your profile, display matching user profiles and (in pseudonymous form) to show you ads (see section 4).

We delete this data when you delete your account. The legal basis for this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) b) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

### 3.2 Optional details

You may add many optional details to your user profile or enter search parameters. They particularly help LOVOO to select other user profiles by various criteria, suggest them to the user and display them in LOVOO. Additional details increase the probability of getting in touch with matching user profiles. However, these details are entirely optional, and the user can see, enter, modify or delete them in the Details section of the profile,

We collect, save and use the data you enter so that you can use LOVOO.

Whereas these optional details are visible as "public" information to other logged-in LOVOO users, the user owning the affected user profile can modify or delete them at any time via the Preferences section of the profile. This data may also be used for ads (see section 4 for information about advertising).

We delete this data when you delete your account. The legal basis for this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) b) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

### 3.3 Location data

LOVOO's offering includes so-called location-based services which display specific choices tailored to the user's location. A user can therefore be shown other users in the vicinity. To be able to provide these functions within the LOVOO app, LOVOO collects location data by means of GPS of the terminal device concerned as well as location data of nearby radio access nodes. Provided that the site survey is enabled, and permission is granted, the location will be periodically transferred to LOVOO GmbH and will be respectively processed and used.

Before collection of location data, users must allow the collection of location data. The location data is then processed in accordance with this privacy statement. If activated and granted, the location data is transferred to LOVOO GmbH at regular intervals to be processed and used.

Users can change this functionality at any time by displaying the Preferences of their terminal device's operating system at any time to either allow or disallow the collecting of location data.

Location data will also be used for advertising purposes, if the user has not objected to this in the app settings. (See section 4 for information about advertising).

We store this data for up to 14 days. The legal basis for this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) b) or f) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

### 3.4 IP addresses

We keep the users' IP addresses for safety and checking purposes. The aim is to prevent abuse of the service. This data is used to prevent and fight fake-profiles, illegal activity and spam and to secure the integrity and stability of the LOVOO platform. For this purpose, we store the full data up to 90 days. The legal basis for this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) f) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

For technical reasons the IP address will be transferred to advertising partner, see below. LOVOO GmbH has selected its advertising partners with due diligence to ensure that your privacy is protected by contractual restrictions and the law.

### 3.4 Payment data

External payment service providers handle the transactions involved when a user does any In-App purchases via LOVOO, buys credits or subscribes to our chargeable premium service. LOVOO GmbH neither collects nor processes any payment data of shopping transactions. Instead, the payment service providers take care of entering and processing the payment data directly. All that LOVOO GmbH and the payment service providers do is to exchange technical data (e.g. the transaction ID) in order to validate the purchases. We save this data until your user account is deleted or beyond this point, until a time when the data is no longer subject to any tax-related, commercial or other statutory storage obligations. The legal basis for this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) b) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## 4\. How does LOVOO use my data for advertising?

LOVOO GmbH decided to run LOVOO as a freemium service which lets every user obtain a basic LOVOO version free of charge. Users of the free version will be shown ads. The ads shown in LOVOO contain our own advertising matters (such as the premium products of LOVOO) or content ordered by an advertising firm in so-called campaigns. Campaigns may be personalised to tailor them to specific user groups (e.g., ads for cosmetic products just for female or male users; skateboard ads only for persons under 25, etc.). Some ads shown in LOVOO are mediated by external service providers.

### 4.1. Which data is used for advertising and who is it given to?

LOVOO GmbH can use LOVOO to show third-party ads which may be tailored to the users' assumed specific interests (personalised ads) or targeted to certain user groups grouped by age, location or gender. The users can object to the use of its data in the privacy settings of the app. We and our advertising partners will only use non-sensitive data, that the you have published on LOVOO and information about your device and your connection. Under no circumstances will we share your name, your e-mail address, your profile picture or your exact location or similar data that allows a direct inference of your real person with our advertising partners.

Whenever such personalised ads are shown, the third-party provider whose ad is shown in LOVOO or whose services are used to show ads of other third parties the following pseudonymous data may be transferred (" **forwarded data** "):

  * advertiser ID

  * your published age and gender

  * your coarse location

  * technical data of the terminal device

  * LOVOO usage data

  * data of ads shown




Forwarded data is disclosed to the following categories of recipients for the purposes explained:

  * ad server services operators

  * tracking services operators

  * affiliate networks

  * customer relationship services operators

  * other sales & marketing partners




**You can object to this processing at any time by going to the privacysettings of the LOVOO app and. You can also reset your Advertising ID in your device settings. In that case a new Advertising ID is created which will not be joined with older data. With this you can ensure, that you will not see any ads based on the forwarded data before you have objected to the transfer.**

All our partners are obligated to process forwarded data only on accordance with the high data protection principles of the European Union and only for advertising purposes. This means, that all partners are obligated no not identify the real user / or remove the Pseudonymity of the data.

The recipients of forwarded data are sometimes seated outside of the European Union. LOVOO GmbH transfers forwarded data only to third countries, if the data protection level of the third country is adequate or the recipients has provided appropriate safeguards.

Forwarded data is transferred to the following countries:

  * USA (EU-US-Privacy-Shield and EU Standard Contract Clause)

  * Israel (Adequacy decision of the European Union)




The Privacy Shield treaty, the Adequacy decision and the EU Standard Contract Clause can be reviewed at the website of the EU commission (<https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en>)

### 4.2. What is an advertiser ID and how is it used?

For tracking and advertising, the LOVOO app uses the so-called advertiser ID, i.e. the "Advertiser Identifier" (IDFA) for offerings of Apple Inc. and the "Android Advertiser ID" (advertiser ID) for offerings of Google. Inc. (jointly the " **advertiser ID(s)** "). These advertiser IDs are unique non-permanent numbers identifying a specific terminal device. They are provided by iOS for offerings of Apple Inc. or by Android for offerings of Google Inc. As opposed to vendor advertiser IDs (generated by latest-generation operating systems and identical for the apps of just one provider), the advertiser ID is the same as the one transferred to other companies when running their apps. The user can deactivate the generation of the Advertiser-ID. On an apple device this can be done in the iOS preferences, under "Privacy" -- "Ads" by enabling the option "no ad tracking"; for a user owning an Android this can be achieved by opening the "Google Settings" (or first "Settings" and then "Google"), clicking on "Display" and ticking the option "Disable personalised ads. The Advertiser ID is pseudonymous and LOVOO GmbH will not be joined with other user data to identify him for advertising purposes.

The Advertiser ID will be used by LOVOO GmbH and our advertising partner as described above to show you personalized advertising and to analyse this advertising. You can always object to this pseudonymous use by disabling the Advertiser ID as described above or objecting in the privacy settings of our app.

For further details and Google Inc.'s privacy policy visit: <https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/>

### 4.3. Using location data

Apart from collecting the location data by running GPS Location (see section 3.3) to enable the location-based services, LOVOO GmbH collects and uses other location data to show the user ads in LOVOO tailored to the user's location and profile. LOVOO GmbH will never forward the exact location to our advertising partners. To protect your privacy all provided location data is coarse by around 2 km. To our knowledge with this data the identification of an individual is not or only with an unreasonable and illegal measures possible.

**For users that are sensitive to privacy question, we offer a separate option in the apps privacy settings to object of the use of location data for the future.**

### 4.4 legal basis for the use of personal data for advertising purposes

LOVOO GmbH bases the processing of sharing of the above data on the performance of the contract with you (Article 6 (1) b) GDPR in connection with Nr. 11.2. of our Terms of Service) and the legitimate interests pursued by us (Article 6 (1) f) GDPR).

We offer our users a service under the Freemium model, which means, that certain parts of LOVOO are free to use. In Exchange for using the LOVOO platform without charge, LOVOO GmbH displays personalized advertisings and process and shares pseudonymous data as specified above.

Pre-requirement for all data transfer is that the recipient ensures by contractual, legal, technical and organizational measure that the data processing is always in compliance with privacy law.

We have decided to only share data, which -- even in the event of an unlawful disclosure or by hacking of our partners -- is not sensitive for individual users. We thus only share data in pseudonymous form and only data that the user has made public or is -- by its nature -- not sensitive like device and network data.

### 5.1 Cookies and cookie policy

The LOVOO domain uses cookies to make using the LOVOO domain a very comfortable experience. Cookies are small text files temporarily stored locally by the Internet browser (so-called session cookies) or on the hard disk of either the mobile device or the computer (so-called permanent cookies). You can set your browser application to refusing to accept cookies or to asking you before a cookie is accepted. If cookies are accepted, the user is assigned an alias ID. A cookie neither runs programs on the user's terminal device nor does it transfer viruses. Session cookies are temporarily stored and deleted when you end your browser session.

LOVOO GmbH also uses cookies to increase the safety of the LOVOO domain, e.g. to authenticate a user during a session in order to avoid cross-site scripting or to prevent phishing and scamming.

In the name of LOVOO GmbH, tracking/analysis services providers (for details see section 5.2 Tracking and analysis services providers) upload cookies to a user's device in order to capture that user's usage data. This set of data includes details collected while the user is browsing the pages of the LOVOO or other domain or clicking on ad banners. These cookies are used to display tailored ads, optimise advertising campaign reports and to avoid repeatedly showing the same ads.

Users have the option to influence the usage of cookies, most browsers provide a setup option for restricting or completely prohibiting the saving of cookies. Please note, though, that disabling the use of cookies may limit the use and convenience of LOVOO.

For further details, please read our Cookie Policy at <https://lovoo.com/legal/cookies>.

### 5.2 Tracking, analysis service and security providers

By analysing what its visitors do, LOVOO optimises its services and how they are offered. To this end, LOVOO GmbH deploys methods able to analyse visits to the LOVOO domain or the LOVOO app. We also use tracking tools provided by third parties in order to analyse the reach of various advertising and marketing campaigns. Running third-party tools may involve the transfer of personal data.

While data processing mainly helps to troubleshoot LOVOO, it is also important for optimising LOVOO and adapting it to its users' needs. Web analysis provides further details which are useful for LOVOO GmbH to obtain key facts about the number of visitors and how they distribute over time, about favourite content and the time users spend on our site. It may sometimes be possible or necessary to verify whether a user profile was created in response to a specific promotional activity. The data is further used for fraud and spam prevention. To actually analyse the user data, it is transferred to various third-party providers.

LOVOO currently uses the following analysis and tracking services providers:

**Crashlytics (Fabric)**

The LOVOO app runs the analysis tool "Crashlytics" (Fabric) supplied by Crashlytics, 1 Kendall Square, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA (" **Crashlytics** "). This analysis utility uses the users' IP addresses albeit always after making them anonymous. It is therefore impossible to trade an address back to a real person. Crashlytics provides LOVOO GmbH with real-time analyses of system crashes which is a great help in maintaining and improving the LOVOO app or LOVOO domain. Details transferred are one user ID, the clicks as well as technical device data needed to analyse the error.

For further data protection details, read the privacy policy of Crashlytics: <http://try.crashlytics.com/terms/>

The main purpose of tracking and the analysis of user behaviour that this entails is to fulfil our contractual obligations, especially to reduce crashes, bugs and to improve our product. The legal basis for this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) b) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

**Google Analytics**

LOVOO runs " **Google Analytics** " supplied by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (" **Google** "). LOVOO GmbH wishes to make you aware of the fact that, in LOVOO, Google Analytics has been extended by IP masking function "_gat._anonymizeIp" which ensures that IP addresses are made anonymous first.

_Please note the following details regarding the use of Google Analytics:_

Google Analytics uses cookies to enable the analysis of how LOVOO is used. As a rule, the cookie transfers the details of how you use LOVOO to a Google server in the US and stores them there. First of all, and provided that IP anonymisation is enabled, however, Google shortens your IP address used within the EU Member States or within other members of the Treaty on the European Economic Area. In the name of LOVOO GmbH, Google will use these details to analyse how you use our service, to compile activity reports and to provide the operator with other services linked to your use of LOVOO.

We only use Google Analytics with the user's consent, by allowing us to set the necessary cookies. We save this data for 26 months. The legal basis for this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

**Adjust**

LOVOO uses "adjust", an app usage analysis tool supplied by adjust GmbH, Saarbrücker Str. 37 a in 10405 Berlin, Germany. When installing the LOVOO app, adjust will save installation and event data of your iOS or Android app. This helps us understand how our users are interacting with the LOVOO app. It also allows us to analyse and improve our mobile advertising campaigns. Analysis by adjust is based on the IDFA or the Advertiser ID as well as your anonymous IP and MAC address. This unilaterally anonymous data disallows to identify you or your mobile device. In case you wish to disable tracking by adjust, please go to [www.adjust.com/opt-out](http://www.adjust.com/opt-out).

The legal basis for this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) f) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

After clicking on the embedded picture, you will be taken to the associated Instagram, YouTube, Pinterest, Twitter, Facebook or Google+ page. That is to say that user data will not be transferred to the provider until you click on a link. The legal basis for this processing of personal data is Article 6 (1) a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Provided that you and your user profile are logged in to the social destination network at the time, your click on the button will be associated with your visit to LOVOO.

## 7\. How is data processed and used to prevent and fight fake-profiles, illegal activity and spam and to secure the integrity and stability of the LOVOO platform?

Personal data is used as described below used to prevent and fight fake-profiles, illegal activity and spam and to secure the integrity and stability of the LOVOO platform.

  * IP and email addresses are saved to detect spam & scam for as long as the user is active.


  * Messages are automatically checked for specific keywords but not saved for this purpose.

  * Personal data such as an active user's sex, age and location is saved and pooled with other non-personal data in order to detect any abnormalities.

  * Whereas previous phone numbers are saved to check suspicious profiles sent by SMS, such phone numbers cannot be associated with the verified user.




**Google reCaptcha**

We use Google's reCaptcha service to protect the LOVOO platform. The reCaptcha is used to detect if the Input has been made by a human or by fraudulent, automated machines. For this purpose, your IP address and other data required by the Google Service is transferred to Google.

For this service Google's privacy statement applies: <https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/>.

**CloudFlare**

LOVOO GmbH uses technology of CloudFlare Inc, Inc 665 3rd St. 200, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA to protect the LOVOO platform and increase the security and stability of the platform. For this purpose, CloudFlare and/or LOVOO will -- among others - set cookies on your device, analyse your device and network data to detect and differentiate legitimate LOVOO users from hackers, SPAM, etc. Cloudflare processes this data only on behalf of LOVOO and not for their own purpose. Additional information for this can be found at: <https://www.cloudflare.com/security-policy>.

**Legal basis**

The legal basis for this processing is Article 6 (1) f) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). LOVOO GmbH has a legitimate interest in keeping the LOVOO platform stable and free of SPAM, illegal activity and fake-profiles.

## 8\. How is data deleted and back-ups created?

Deleting a user profile (attention: not by deleting the LOVOO app!) or notifying us accordingly deletes all of that user's data. Apart from that, users can remove profile details themselves or ask us to do so at any time.

Exempt of such a deletion is data, that we have to retain by statutory storage obligations, for winding up the contract and for performance of contract with other users. For example, we will not promptly delete the following data:

  * Payment data and data regarding reward claims, which we have to retain for tax-related, commercial or other statutory storage obligations.

  * Data, which you have shared with other users in chats, like messages or pictures (see below)




**When do we delete data, that you have shared with other users?**

We delete data which is accessible in your public profile, like profile pictures, stream pictures and profile data, promptly as specified above.

We can't delete data that you have shared non-publicly with other users without infringing the rights of this other user. Thus, we can delete chat data only after both users have delete their profile.

**How long will it take to delete the data?**

Such details will be immediately removed from the productive databases and, thus from the LOVOO interface; however, it may take up to 14 days until the data is removed from all of LOVOO's server layers, cache memories and back-up databases.

If deletion is not possible, we will anonymize the data or restrict the processing.

**In case certain facts lead to the suspicion that a user profile uses LOVOO illegally or contrary to the contract with us, we reserve the right to check and perhaps save profile files before deleting them. This is to protect the users of LOVOO GmbH's offerings.**

Irrespective of data deleted because of user-deleted profiles, LOVOO automatically and periodically deletes historical data no longer needed to perform the contract (e.g. historical location details and IP data).

In order to protect its datasets, LOVOO GmbH creates so-called back-up copies which are overwritten and, thus, deleted for good after 14 days. Deletion also affects log files that may be contained in these back-ups. Log files will also be deleted when a user profile is completely deleted.

## 9\. How does LOVOO ensure data integrity?

The trust of its users and protecting their data is of great importance to LOVOO GmbH. To prevent unauthorised access to or disclosure of user data and to ensure the integrity and appropriate use of the data, LOVOO GmbH has appropriate physical, technical and administrative procedures in place to protect the information collected by LOVOO GmbH.

To provide highest-level protection of the user data, the offerings of the LOVOO domain or LOVOO app rely on a secure SSL connection that allows the transfer of nothing but encrypted data.
