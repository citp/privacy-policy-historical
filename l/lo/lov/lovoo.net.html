Google Analytics<br>
<br>
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", text files which are saved on your computer and which allow website usage to be analyzed. The information created by the cookies about your use of this website (including your IP address in anonymous form) is transferred to a Google server in the USA and saved there. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, in order to compile reports about website activity for the website operator and to produce additional services related to website and internet usage. Google may also communicate this information to third parties, where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google behalf. You can avoid the installation of cookies by appropriately adjusting your browser software; however, we point out that in this case you may not be able to make full use of all the features of this website.  By using this website, you agree that the data that Google collects about you may be processed in the way described above and for the above-mentioned purpose.  <br>

<br>
<br>
1. Sites covered by this privacy statement<br>
<br>
This privacy statement covers all websites and domains owned by LOVOO, as well as websites and domains of fully owned subsidiaries of LOVOO.  <br>
<br>
Links to websites of third-party providers<br>
<br>
On the LOVOO website you may find links to websites of third-party providers (for example, the "Like" button on Facebook, links to fan pages on Facebook, LinkedIn etc.) by which you can easily access further information or other relevant websites. By clicking on these links you leave the LOVOO website. LOVOO has no control whatsoever over these websites or their data protection practices, which may differ from LOVOO´s practices. By linking to third-party websites LOVOO does not endorse or support in any way the content contained there, excluding the personal data which it has made available to these third-party providers, or which has been collected by them and is not covered by LOVOO´s data protection statement.  You should therefore read through the data protection statement of all companies before disclosing personal information.    <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Collection of personal data<br>
<br>
LOVOO collects, exports and uses personal data with the objective of improving our services and understanding better your needs and interests. This is done only with respective notice and with consent of those concerned, as well as the submission of any required documents with data protection authorities. For example, if you order products or services, request information, subscribe to marketing or support materials, register, take part in competitions or surveys, or apply for a job at LOVOO, we will ask you for personal information required to complete this transaction.    Personal information provided by you on these pages may include your name, address, telephone number and email address, as well as other unique information such as user Ids and passwords, transaction information, your product and service preferences and contact preferences.    <br>
<br>
If you use our referral service to tell a friend about our website, we will ask you for the email address of this person and send them a single invitation to visit the website. LOVOO uses and stores this personal information for the sole purpose of sending this single email and to enable the blocking of additional such messages if necessary.  <br>
<br>
In addition to the information provided by you, information may also be acquired during your visits to LOVOO websites. LOVOO uses tools for automatic data collection such as web beacons, Google DART cookies, integrated web links and other common tools for the collection of information. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to our website. These include, for example, browser type and language, access times and the address of the website from which you arrived at the LOVOO website. Your IP address, clickstream data (i.e. the sites you look at, the links you click on and other actions relating to LOVOO websites) and product information may also be recorded. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when surfing the internet and by which the web server is able to localize and identify your computer. Computers use this IP address to communicate on the internet and therefore enable users to surf and purchase. LOVOO may also employ some of these tools for automatic data collection on specific emails sent by LOVOO. These tools collect information if you open the email or click on a link contained in the email. LOVOO also refers to commercially available sources that are considered credible for the collection of information. Information obtained in this way may include names, addresses, email addresses and demographic data. Information obtained from these commercial sources may be used alongside information acquired by LOVOO from your visits to LOVOO websites. For example, LOVOO may compare geographical information acquired from commercial sources with the IP address collected by the tools for automatic data collection, in order to determine your general geographic area.       <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

4. Who is your data passed on to?<br>
<br>
Other than described in this statement, LOVOO does not sell, rent or lease your personal information to third parties. LOVOO gives the following personal information: <br>
LOVOO uses the services of service providers and suppliers to deliver complete products, services and customer solutions and to assist LOVOO with marketing and communication initiatives. These providers and suppliers include, for example, providers of customer support and live-help and email service providers. Service providers are under a contractual obligation to treat information entrusted to them on behalf of LOVOO as confidential and not to use it for any purposes other than for services provided to LOVOO.  From time to time LOVOO carries out joint marketing initiatives with other companies. Certain LOVOO services and marketing communications are delivered at the same time as those of other companies as part of these initiatives.  For some of these services and communications you have the opportunity to pass on your personal information, both to LOVOO and to the other companies involved in these initiatives. Examples of this include marketing communications from LOVOO and other companies, or the opportunity to register online for software products of different companies. If you prefer to give your personal information exclusively to LOVOO, LOVOO will not pass on this information to other companies taking part in these marketing initiatives. If you decide to share your personal information with other companies, the handling and use of this information falls under the respective data protection provisions of this company.  <br>

Other than in the cases described in this statement, LOVOO does not disclose your personal information to third parties without your express authorization, except for the following purposes:<br>
(i) in response to a legal request for information from police or government authorities;<br>
(ii) to comply with laws, regulations, citations or court orders;<br>
(iii) to prevent fraud or to enforce and protect the rights and ownership of LOVOO and its subsidiaries; or<br>
(iv) to protect the personal security of LOVOO members. <br>
Circumstances may arise where for strategic or other commercial reasons LOVOO decides to sell, purchase, merge or carry out other restructuring. Such an operation may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective buyers or buyers or the obtaining of such information on the part of the seller. In such operations LOVOO always protects the information entrusted to the company to the greatest possible extent.     <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

• Click on the email link "Opt out" or "Unsubscribe" or follow the instructions contained in every communication to terminate the subscription.<br>
• Go to the webpage(s) where you originally subscribed and follow the instructions to terminate the subscription. You can access subscription webpages from many LOVOO subscriptions.<br>

<br>
LOVOO endeavors to achieve the greatest possible accuracy of its stored personal data. For this purpose LOVOO has implemented technologies, administrative procedures and policies. LOVOO gives individuals, within reasonable limits, access to personal data that LOVOO has made available to them and also the opportunity to verify this data and correct it if necessary or demand the anonymization, blocking or deletion of this data. Furthermore, to protect your privacy and security we take the appropriate measures to verify your identity – for example, by entering a password and a user ID – before we allow you access to your data. In order to view or change personal data that you have directly provided to LOVOO, you can return to the webpage where you originally submitted the data and follow the instructions given there, or, if this function is available.          <br>

LOVOO takes extremely seriously the trust that you place in us. LOVOO employs appropriate physical, technical and administrative procedures to protect the information collected by LOVOO, in order to prevent unauthorized access to your data or its disclosure, to maintain the integrity of the data and to ensure its correct usage. When collecting or passing on sensitive data such as credit card information, SSL encryption (Secure Sockets Layer) can be employed by the user, which guarantees that no one can view your data except us. This security measure is activated when you see the symbol of a broken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser) at the bottom of your browser window.  When accessing the domain in the address line of your browser, use https://www.lovoo.com instead of http://www.@lovoo.com to activate SSL encryption.       <br>
