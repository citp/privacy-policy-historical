We hate junk mail too!

We will email you to process your order and afterwards to introduce you to the benefits of our loyalty programme. We will never pass on your email address or personal information to a third party for marketing purposes other than our own. We will provide your email address to delivery services for the sole purpose of sending you tracking notifications for your delivery.

To ensure we always provide you with the top-notch service you deserve, Lovehoney work closely with the independent reviews database [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/lovehoney.com).

We may share your personal information with members of Lovehoney's group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries.

If we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose such information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets as may reasonably be required.

Our site may contain links to other websites that are not owned or operated by us. We do not control, recommend or endorse and are not responsible for these sites or their content, products, services or privacy policies. Please refer to the privacy policy of the third party website for guidance on the operation, function and management of that website. You should also independently assess the authenticity of any website which appears or claims that it is one of our sites (including those linked to through an email).

All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet may not be completely secure.

Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our privacy policy and how they affect you.

The Data Protection Act (the "Act") has various provisions which ensure that any person who has access to your personal information must comply with strict rules.

The Act provides the following principles, which we follow at all times:

• We will process your data fairly and lawfully.

• We will obtain your data only for specified and lawful purposes, and shall not use it for any other purpose.

• We will ensure that personal data held shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose for which it is held.

• We will ensure that personal data shall be processed in accordance with your rights under the Act.

• We will take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect any personal data from any destruction, damage or loss.

• We will not transfer your personal data outside the European Economic Area unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection.

The Data Protection Act gives you the right to access and check information held about you. Should you wish we can provide you with all the information that we hold about you on payment of £10 for each request, which is to meet our costs in providing this information to you.

We control and operate our site from the UK (regardless of where hosting servers are located). All matters relating to the site are governed by the laws of England and Wales, without reference to conflict or choice of law principles. You agree that jurisdiction and venue for any legal proceeding relating to the site shall be the courts of England and Wales. We do not warrant or imply that the Site or materials on it are appropriate for use outside of the EU. If you are located outside of the EU, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws.

If for any reason any part of this policy is found to void or unenforceable, it will be deemed severed from the remainder of the policy, which will continue in full force and effect.
