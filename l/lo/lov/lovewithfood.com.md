Except as may be otherwise specified herein, this policy also does not apply to information you may provide to us offline.

## Aggregate Information

On an aggregate, non-personally identifiable level we may also use this data to analyze site usage, customize the site's content, layout, and services, and for disclosure to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes and to demonstrate to them the value of our own site.
