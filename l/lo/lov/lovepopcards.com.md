Last Revised: May 24, 2018

Lovepop (“Lovepop”, “we”, “us” or “our”) spends a lot of time thinking about what is important to you. We know that includes making the most of birthdays and holidays, spectacular paper sculptures, bloom-filled trees, and sharing unexpected Magical Moments with the people you love. 

We also know your privacy is very important to you. It is to us, too. 

This Privacy Policy explains how and why we use, share and protect information that could be used to identify you (“Personal Information”) and the choices you have about Personal Information. This Privacy Policy applies to visitors to [www.lovepopcards.com](https://www.lovepopcards.com/) and [wedding.lovepop.com](https://wedding.lovepop.com/) (the “Websites”) and to our online customers (together, “Users” or “you”).

Note that reviews or posts on forums will be public so you should use care before posting information about yourself online.

When you visit our Websites, we may automatically collect certain information, namely:

  * your usage of the Websites, such as the pages you visit and the products you search for;
  

  * your transactions with us, for example, the type of product you purchased and the costs of each product;
  

  * technical information, for example, your IP address, time zone and location, and the type of operating system and web browser you use and related information; and 
  

  * data we or others collect about you from cookies and similar tracking technologies, which is discussed below in the section on “Use of Cookies.”



_Information from Other Sources_   
From time to time, we may acquire additional information about our Users from third parties, such as the Postal Service and third parties that assist us in the provision of products and services requested by you. This may include third-party analytics providers and advertising networks. 

OUR USE OF INFORMATION   
We use the Personal Information that we collect for various purposes.

We use it to generate your orders and fulfill the orders you place.

We use Personal Information to fulfill our legal obligations, like keeping records for compliance purposes.

We may also combine the information which you provide to us (such as your registration details) with information which we collect about you (such as information about your orders) and/or receive from other sources, and use this combined information for the purposes set out above.

PAYMENT INFORMATION 

Lovepop uses third party payment processors Shopify, Stripe, Amazon Pay and PayPal to process payments made for products and services via the Websites. All online payments will be conducted in accordance with Payment Card Industry (PCI) data security standards. Your billing information (which is only used by these payment processors for fraud protection) is encrypted before being communicated to them. Subject to the below exceptions, your credit card details are communicated directly from your browser to these payment processors - Lovepop never sees your full Permanent Account Number (PAN). 

_Shopify_   
Shopify, Inc. provides us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you. Some of your Personal Information is stored through Shopify’s data storage, databases and the general Shopify application. Shopify stores your data on a secure server behind a firewall.

If you use a credit card to make a purchase (with the exception of wedding and membership purchases, which are discussed below), then Shopify stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.

All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. 

PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers. 

For more insight, you may also want to read Shopify’s [Terms of Service](https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms) here or [Privacy Statement](https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy) here.

_Stripe_   
We use Stripe, Inc. to process payments for wedding or membership purchases. For Stripe payments, if on the payment page you have requested that your card details be remembered and the payment was successful, Lovepop stores the card type, a Masked PAN (only the first 6 and last 4 digits) and the card’s expiration date as well as an associated token. This information is stored by us so that you and we can identify your stored card and use it for further payments at Lovepop. This stored information can be deleted via the payment form on the Website should you wish to do so. We also store separately the last 4 digits and card type so that we can identify transactions made by a particular card. 

_Pay Pal, Amazon Pay and Apple Pay_   
If you choose to pay with PayPal, Amazon Pay or Apple Pay, we only store the tokens required to identify the transaction, issue refunds and identify transactions.
