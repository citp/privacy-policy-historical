## How do we use your personal information?

We take data protection law seriously, so below we have set out exactly how and why we use your information, and what our legal basis is to be able to use your information in each way.

### Advertising

We work with a network of advertising partners to display adverts on our website, as this allows us to continue operating our website and offering a free service to our visitors. We use targeted advertising to personalize your experience on our website and only show you adverts that are relevant you, based on your browsing habits. In order to do this, we and our advertising partners use cookies and tracking pixels to remember and form a profile of the websites you visit. This does not use your name or other personal details, but a unique ID that each website gives your browser.

We understand that not everyone wants to see targeted adverts, so we will advise you when you first visit our website the types of cookies we use and if you consent to their use. However, please bear in mind that if you don't allow us to use certain cookies it may prevent you from accessing parts of our website or result in a loss of functionality which degrades your experience of the website. You will still see adverts, but they will not necessarily be relevant to you.

For more information about how we use cookies for advertising, please see our [Cookies Policy](https://web.archive.org/cookies).

We share the information that you provide to us with our staff so that we can run our website and provide our services to you. We may share the information that you provide to us with other websites that we operate.

We will only store your personal information for as long as we need it for the purposes for which it was collected. Where we provide you with any service, we will retain any information you provide to us at least for as long as we continue to provide that service to you.

If we rely on your consent to use your personal data, such as in connection with marketing or advertising, we may keep your personal data until you withdraw your consent.

In all other circumstances, we will keep your information for a reasonable amount of time. This period of time will be dictated by the nature of the data and how it relates to offering you the best service we can.

## How do we protect your personal information?

We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this policy.

We try to ensure that all information you provide to us is transferred securely via the website (always check for the padlock symbol and "https" at the beginning of the URL). Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.

All information you provide to us is stored on third party secure servers hosted with the Google Cloud Platform, which is owned by Google LLC.

## What rights do you have in respect of your personal information?

### You have the right to access your personal data

You have the right to ask us to confirm whether or not we hold any of your personal information. If we do, you have the right to have a copy of your information and to be informed of the following:

  * Why we have been using your information
  * What categories of information we were using
  * Who we have shared the information with
  * How long we envisage holding your information



In order to maintain the security of your information, we will have to verify your identity before we provide you with a copy of the information we hold.

The first copy of your information that you request from us will be provided free of charge, if you require further copies within a short period of time we may charge an administrative fee to cover our costs.

### You have the right to correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data

Where you have requested a copy of the information we hold about you, you may notice that there are inaccuracies in the records, or that certain parts are incomplete. If this is the case, you can [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/f3fbae4t.php) so that we can correct our records.

In those situations, you have the right to have your personal data deleted. If you believe one of these situations applies to you, please get in touch using our website.

### You have the right to have a copy of your data transferred to you or a third party in a compatible format

Also known as data portability, you have the right to obtain a copy of your personal data for your own purposes. This right allows you to move, copy or transfer your personal data more easily from one IT system to another, in a safe and secure way.

If you would like us to transfer a copy of your data to you or another organization in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, please [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/f3fbae4t.php). There is no charge for you exercising this right.

### You have the right to object to us using your information for our legitimate interests

Sometimes, we use your personal information to pursue our own legitimate interests. We aim to always ensure that your rights and information are properly protected. If you believe that the way we are using your data is not justified due to its impact on you or your rights, you have the right to object. Unless we have a compelling reason to continue, we must stop using your personal data for these purposes.

In order to exercise your right to object to our use of your data for the purposes above, please [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/f3fbae4t.php).

### You have the right to restrict how we use your personal data

You have the right to ask us to stop using your personal data in any way other than simply keeping a copy of it. This right is available where:

  * You have informed us that the information we hold about you is inaccurate, and we have not yet been able to verify this
  * You have objected to us using your information for our own legitimate interests and we are in the process of considering your objection
  * We have used your information in an unlawful way, but you do not want us to delete your data
  * We no longer need to use the information, but you need it for a legal claim



If you believe any of these situations apply, please [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/f3fbae4t.php).

### You have rights related to automated decision-making and profiling

We and our advertising partners carry out automated decision-making to personalize the adverts that we show to you on our website. This involves "profiling" or creating a profile of you and your browsing habits based on the websites that you visit which participate in the advertising networks. This profile is not linked to your name or other personal details, but to a unique ID that each website gives your browser.

You have the right not to be subject to decisions which will have a legal effect upon you or otherwise significantly affect you based on automated decision making.

If you have any concerns or questions about this right, please [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/f3fbae4t.php).
