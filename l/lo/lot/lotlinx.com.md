                                         PRIVACY STATEMENT
LotLinx values its customers’ and visitors’ privacy and this statement sets forth a summary of how we
collect and use information.
We and our Affiliates collect the information you voluntarily provide to us in connection with using the
LotLinx Services, or through product inquiries, technical support or questions, and service sign-up. In
the future we may collect your information for events and promotions, job applications, and other
inquiries and transactions.
We may also obtain information about you from outside sources. For example, our Affiliates and
Resellers who deploy or sell the LotLinx Services. These entities may share with us certain
information you have previously provided to them. We also may obtain commercially-available
demographic information from third parties. If you engage with us, our Affiliates or other business
partners via digital media platforms also may share certain information with LotLinx to help improve
and continue to innovate its products and services. You may be able to adjust your privacy settings to
limit the sharing of your digital data.
We may collect information about your use of our Services or devices you use to connect to the
Services by automated means, including tracking technologies. These tracking technologies may
include "cookies," which are small lines of text/data that are written onto your computer by a website.
LotLinx and vendors acting on our behalf may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other similar
technologies to operate the Services. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if
you do that, we may not be able to track certain statistics that will allow us to improve or measure the
performance of the products and services we provide to you.
Our Services may include third-party advertising, promotions, co-branded features, links to other
websites, and other programs offered by or in collaboration with third-party businesses. In addition to
collecting information directly from you, these third-party businesses may use web beacons and
cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads, personalize or optimize advertising content, and track
users who click on the links made available through the Services. When you use our Services, these
third-party businesses may collect information about your online activities over time and across third-
party websites or online services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties,
and we encourage you to read their privacy policies, which may apply to these third-party programs.
Some third-party advertising companies may provide a mechanism to opt-out of their tracking or
advertising.
The information that you provide directly to us and that we obtain from others is what we need to serve
you, our affiliates and business customers. This information may include your contact details (such as
name, postal or email address, phone number, Twitter handle or other online aliases); contact
information of individuals with whom you would like to share content; social media identifiers;
demographic information; and other information you may choose to share with us by interacting with
our Site and Services or with our affiliates, business customers or other businesses that share
information with us.
The information we collect by automated means also helps us, our affiliates and our business customers
to provide and tailor various products and services. We may collect the following details by automated
means:


We and our vendors may automatically collect your usage activity, preferences, and browser details
(such as your IP address and browser type), as well the ID and type of the device you use to connect to
our Services, and other details about your use of our Services. This may also include the collection of
information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.
Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based or other
do-not-track ("DNT") mechanisms, LotLinx does not respond to web browser-based DNT signals.
However, certain of our websites participate in the AdChoices program. If the website that you are
visiting displays an AdChoices icon, you may click on the icon and follow instructions to adjust your
privacy preferences. If you opt-out using AdChoices, our sites that participate in the program will no
longer collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or
online services for behavioral advertising purposes.
Some of our Services may collect geo-location data to provide location-related functionality, such as
the location of your nearest Dealer. We may link location data to other information we have collected
about you. We use your information to serve you, our affiliates and business customers. The following
are general purposes for which we may use your information.
We may, for example, use your information to complete a transaction you have asked us to do, such as
sign you up to participate in our dealer Services.
If you request support or other information, we may use your information to respond to your request.
We may follow up with you to notify you periodically about important topics, like Services updates or
changes to our Privacy Statement.
We may use your email address to let you know about current offers, invite you to participate in those
offers and manage your participation in them. We also may use information about your use of our
Services to tailor our offers to your preferences or to offer you products and services that we believe
may be of interest to you. Among other privacy choices described in this Privacy Statement, you may
direct us to not send you email marketing communications by clicking on the unsubscribe link included
in the emails you receive from us.
We may be required by law or internal data retention policies to maintain information about you for a
certain period of time, or to notify you of a security breach. This section describes the types of
organizations with whom we may share your information.
LotLinx may authorize access to your information within our Company, by our employees and other
personnel, to fulfill our obligations to you and to operate the business. Our affiliates and vendors may
access and use your information for the purposes we describe in this Privacy Statement, including as
necessary to provide functionality, products, and services to us and you in connection with the Services.
We may allow our affiliates and vendors to have access to aggregate statistics - that are not linked by us
to any specific consumer - about consumer behavior, sales, traffic patterns, and related Services
information. We may share your information with our marketing partners when, for example, we
participate in a co-branded promotion with another company. We will not share your personal
information with third parties for their own marketing purposes.
If LotLinx should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, or if LotLinx should decide


to buy, sell, or reorganize some part or all of its business, LotLinx reserves the right to disclose your
information, including to prospective or actual purchasers in connection with one of these transactions.
As Required by Law and Other Extraordinary Disclosures. LotLinx may be required to disclose
your information if it:
          !       believes it is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (such as a
          court order, subpoena, search warrant, etc.) or other legal requirements of any
          governmental authority;
          !       would potentially lessen our liability in an actual or potential lawsuit or
          investigation; or
We make reasonable efforts to secure our systems. However, data transmissions over the Internet
cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure the security of any information you
transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.
By providing your email address to us or using the Services, you agree that we can communicate with
you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues. If we learn of a security
breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically. You may have a legal right to receive this notice in
writing. To receive a free written notice in the event of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent
from receiving electronic notice), or if you want to access, correct, update or delete the personal
information we maintain about you, or otherwise adjust your privacy preferences you have previously
provided to us, you should contact us at planadmin@lotlinx.com . You may also write us at LotLinx,
Inc., Attention: Privacy Inquiry 3675 Mt. Diablo Blvd., Suite 300, Lafayette, CA 94549. We reserve
the right to limit or deny access to personal information where providing such access is unreasonably
burdensome or expensive under the circumstances, or as we otherwise deem appropriate. In addition,
please note that we may not be able to edit or delete your personal information stored with our third-
party service providers, or we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not
delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion
request only after we have fulfilled such requirements).
Children. Neither our Site nor our Services are not directed at children or intended to be used by
children. Do not send any information about yourself to us if you are under the age of sixteen (16). In
addition, if we learn a person under the age of thirteen (13) has submitted information to us, we will
attempt to delete this information. If you have reason to believe that we may have accidentally received
information from a child under the age of thirteen (13), please contact us immediately at
planadmin@lotlinx.com.
California Residents. If you are a California resident, you may request that we provide to you:
          !       a list of the categories of personal information about you that LotLinx has
          disclosed to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes during the
          calendar year preceding your request;
          !       the names and addresses of such third parties; and
          !       if the nature of the third parties' business cannot reasonably be determined
          from their names, examples of the products or services marketed, if known to
          LotLinx, sufficient to give you a reasonable indication of the nature of the third
          parties' business.


To submit your request, please email planadmin@lotlinx.com.
