# Lokad, Privacy policy

Customer privacy is very important to us. Simply put: **our customers remain the sole owners of the data they provide.**

## Time-series data and collective forecasts

Each Lokad customer can store time-series data in their Lokad account. We consider that this data is the property of our customers. We may disclose this data to 3rd parties either for technical reasons (such as database backup) or as the result of legal decisions. **Lokad adheres to a policy of fair use of its customer time-series data**. The customer time-series data will not be sold or disclosed to any third party for any commercial purpose.

However, you should be aware that your time-series data will be used anonymously to improve the forecasts of other Lokad customers. This is one of Lokad's core technologies. We believe that this technology is fair for two strong reasons. First, the time-series data synergy process is a very indirect process that happens internally in Lokad. **The other Lokad customers do not have access to your time-series data.** Second, the process is symmetric: the time-series data of the other Lokad customers is used to improve your forecasts as well.

If you believe that your time-series data are too sensitive to be entrusted to Lokad's care, then we suggest that you [obfuscate your time-series data](https://web.archive.org/web/20061219183346id_/http%3A//www.lokad.com/docs/Documentation.aspx#obfuscation).

## Security

All access to the Lokad systems (website and web services) is password protected. We use a one-way hash technology to store your passwords. Intuitively, this means that no password is explicitly stored by the Lokad systems. It is the users' responsibility to safeguard and protect their login information.

## Nominative Information

Lokad will not sell, rent or share any user data in a personally identifiable form with any third party without your express permission. As a business service, Lokad does not target its offerings at, and does not knowingly collect any personal information from underage users.

## Accessing and revising your contact information

If you need to update or change your registration information, you can do so directly through your Lokad account (log in and go to the My Account page). If you choose to cancel your registration and drop Lokad services, please be aware that Lokad may retain residual information for a limited amount of time (typically in the backup copies of our databases).
