Furthermore, this Policy describes the type of information that may be collected by our use of cookies and other technologies across our Website.

This Policy applies to [www.cgi.com](http://www.cgi.com/) and any authorized sub-sites that expressly adopt, display or link back to this Policy.

**Collection and use of personal information**  
We may collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you request information about our services, submit questions to us, subscribe to our services and when you choose to submit your resume in relation to career opportunities posted on our Website.

The personal information provided by you may then be used to communicate with you in connection with your various inquiries, subscriptions or to consider you for employment purposes.

We may also collect information in connection with your visit to our Website through the use of cookies. Such information may be used to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track your movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our visitor base as a whole. The information gathered by these cookies is in the form of aggregated anonymous data; therefore, no personally identifiable information about you is collected by us through cookies. Additional details regarding the use of cookies and other technologies are provided below.

**Disclosure of personal information**  
We may disclose personal information collected through this Website with our affiliates for internal business purposes including considering you for employment.

We may also share information provided by you with service providers that we retain to perform services on our behalf. These service providers are contractually limited from using or disclosing the information except as is necessary to provide services to us or to comply with legal requirements. Furthermore, we may disclose information about you where we are required or permitted by law to do so.

**Links to non-CGI websites and third-party applications**  
This Website may contain links to third-party websites and third-party applications that are not affiliated with CGI. CGI does not in any way endorse or make any representations about such third-party websites and applications. As such, CGI is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such third-party websites and applications that are subject to their own privacy policies. If you choose to access such links, we encourage you to review all third-party site privacy policies before submitting any of your information.

**Our security measures to protect personal information**  
We maintain reasonable physical, technical and administrative safeguards to help protect against the unauthorized access, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information you voluntarily provide to us.

It should be noted that we cannot be held responsible for any personal information you share or post on public spaces, such as our blogs. Such public spaces may be consulted or viewed by anyone visiting our Website and, as such, falls outside the scope of this Policy.

**Access, review and correction**  
You may request information about the existence of your personal information held by CGI and request access to such information in order to access and review it, have it deleted, updated or corrected, subject to legal and contractual restrictions, or rights of refusal.

**Use of technology: cookies and logs**  
As previously mentioned, we use cookies and other technologies, namely logs, to collect information about our visitors and their use of our Website. 

Cookies are identifiers that are transferred to your computer's hard drive through your web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. You may choose to disable all or certain cookies on your computer by modifying your web browser. Most web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) or [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). Please note that if you choose to disable cookies, this may impact the performance of the Website during your visit.

We use certain cookies that are strictly necessary for us to offer you the basic functionalities of our Website, to deliver the services you have specifically asked for and to remember your cookie settings. For instance, we use such cookies to allow us to identify registered visitors and ensure that they can access secure pages, to provide you with your language of choice based on your browser history and to enable you to share content from our Website with social media websites.

It is important to us to maintain our Website to be relevant and up to date to provide visitors with an optimal user experience. To achieve this goal, we use cookies often referred to as “analytic cookies” to collect information to help us understand how our visitors use the Website and how we can improve the Website. It is important to note that these cookies don’t collect information that personally identifies you. The information that is collected is anonymous and allows us to identify the overall patterns of usage rather than any one person’s activity. For example, these cookies keep track of which pages are most popular and help determine why some pages are receiving error messages.

CGI may also use logs to collect information about visitors’ use of the Website. CGI may review server logs for security purposes, for example, to detect intrusions into our network. Server log data, which contains visitors' IP addresses, could in instances of criminal malfeasance be used to trace and identify individuals. In such instances, raw data logs would be shared with appropriate investigative bodies authorized to investigate such breaches of security. Like cookies, logs do not cross reference the information automatically collected with any type of personal information that is voluntarily offered by you on or through this Website. We do not use any behavioral advertising cookies on this Website.

**Changes**  
CGI reserves the right to make changes to this Policy from time to time without notice.
