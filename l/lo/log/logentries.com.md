# Privacy Policy | Logentries

Your privacy is important to Logentries. In the following privacy policy we depicts for you how we collect, store, and protect your information.

Should you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact us.

1.1 Logentries.com and the logentries Service are provided by JLizard Limited trading as logentries.com, an Irish registered private limited company, Registered Company Number 481775 which has its registered office at 111 Delwood Walk, Castleknock, Dublin 15, Ireland (“We”, “us”, “logentries”). Our principal place of business is NovaUCD, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland and we can be contacted at the contact points listed on the logentries.com site.

### 2\. Our Role as Data Processors

2.1 Sign-in Data: We may receive limited personal data about you when you subscribe to the logentries Service (e.g. name, organisation, email address, payment card details etc). We will use and retain this personal data in our role as a “data controller” as defined in the Irish Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 (“DPA”) solely for the purpose of providing you with the logentries Service as further described in our website and in our logentries Customer Agreement. In some cases we may use third party services for customer relationship management. 

2.2 Log Data: While using the logentries Service, the Customer remains solely and exclusively responsible for its own log data. To this end, the Customer warrants, represents and undertakes to JLizard Limited as follows:

(a) That the log data will not contain any personal data (within the meaning of the DPA); or

(b) Where the log data contains personal data, the Customer has obtained all necessary consents from all applicable data subjects to enable the Customer to use and transfer the data (including outside of the EEA) in connection with the logentries Service.

2.3 We reserve the right to conduct analysis on log data processed using our Service although we will endeavour to ensure that we do not process or disclose personal data while doing so.

3.1 The logentries Service is not designed to process personal data. However, if the Customer processes personal data using the logentries Service, the Customer shall comply with its obligations as a data controller and data processor under all applicable Data Protection laws. 

3.2 logentries hosts and stores data on Amazon Web Services’ renowned cloud platform and on other cloud platforms which will be described in our FAQs from time to time. Accordingly, the Customers’ logentries Account data is kept completely separate from the Customers’ other data which remains under its sole ownership and control. 

3.3 The level of security provided in Amazon’s cloud platform is described in more detail on http://aws.amazon.com/security/. Our FAQs also explain the levels of security offered by other cloud providers we may use from time to time.

3.4 If you are not satisfied with the levels of security offered by our cloud providers, you should restrict the nature and amount of personal data or confidential information which you include in your log data.

3.5 If encryption is available, logentries encrypts Customer data before it is transferred over the internet to our cloud. Data can not be encrypted using UDP to transfer data or for older versions of python if using the logentries agent. We also ensure the integrity of the logentries website data by using SSL authentication between the Customer and the cloud, meaning that the cloud must show valid a SSL certificate to each Customer to initiate the link. However, as we are reliant on the cloud platforms provided by our cloud providers, we do not provide any SLAs or warranties on data security. However we will make all reasonable efforts to avoid loss of data. Our approach for handling data storage is published in the FAQ section of our website.

5.1 We will contact you for marketing purposes in line with any consents you have provided to us at the point when you provided us with your data or subsequently.

6.1 We reserve the right to transfer information (including your Personal Data) to a third party in the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of our company provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of the Privacy Policy and provided that the third party only uses your Personal Data for the purposes that you provided it to us.
