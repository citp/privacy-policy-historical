	LogoMaker is owned and operated by Arteis, Inc. When you're visiting the LogoMaker site, we don't want you to worry that we will misuse the information you share with us about yourself.  It is important to us that all of our customers understand what information we gather about them, how we use it, and how we work to protect it.  By using the LogoMaker service and this website, you consent to the information practices described in this policy.  Keep in mind that your use of the LogoMaker service is also subject to, and controlled by, the LogoMaker Customer Agreement.
	<br><br>

	<span class="textSize4 grey">Information Collection</span>
	<ul>
	<li>Personally Identifiable Information is information that can be used to locate you, contact you, or determine your specific identity.  When other information is linked to Personally Identifiable Information, it also becomes Personally Identifiable Information.</li>
	<li>LogoMaker collects Personally Identifiable Information from you in several ways:</li>
	<br><br>
	<ol>
	<li>	When you register for the LogoMaker Service, we ask you for basic registration information, such as your name, company, address, email address, phone, fax, and other basic contact information ("Registration Information").</li>
	<li>	When you place an order or subscribe to a product through the LogoMaker service, we may collect the appropriate billing information, including your credit card number, expiration date, and billing address ("Billing  Information").  This information is associated with your Registration Information in a database and will be kept for future purchases.</li>
	<li>	We may ask you for voluntary personal information at other times, including but not limited to when you provide opinions, enter a contest or promotion, or report a problem with the LogoMaker service ("Optional Information").</li>
	<li>	When you submit a request for more information or assistance, LogoMaker will keep a record of the request and the manner in which it was processed ("Customer Service Information").</li>
	</ol>
	<br>

	<li>In addition to the collection of Personally Identifiable Information, we may also automatically receive and record information in our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, your computer's name, the type and version of your web browser, referrer addresses, and other generally-accepted log information.  We may also record page views (hit counts) and other general statistical and tracking information.  This information will not be not be associated with your Personally Identifiable Information.</li>

	<li> LogoMaker will use email to communicate with Client.
	By using the LogoMaker service you agree to receive status notifications, a monthly
	newsletter, and carefully selected special offers and promotions for our services,
	or for third-party services LogoMaker believes could be of value to Client.
	At no time will you receive more than two special offers a month and you are free to unsubscribe at anytime by using the unsubscribe link found on each promotional newsletter, or by emailing support@logomaker.com and requesting to be unsubscribed.
	LogoMaker may or may not use a third party to send email, however, your personally
	Identifiable information will never be disclosed or shared with another party without
	your explicit permission as required by law.</li>
	<li>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.  LogoMaker stores this Information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.  Your friend may contact us at support@logomaker.com to request that we remove this information from our database.</li>
	<li>	While using the LogoMaker reader to access or review a particular design project ("LogoMaker Reader"), the reader software will record the date and time that you reviewed the design works.  Such information will not be associated with Personally Identifiable Information ("Reader Information").</li>
	</ul>

	<span class="textSize4 grey">Limits on Information Collection</span>

	<ul>
	<li>	By default, the LogoMaker Reader will record the non-personally identifiable Reader Information described above.  If you do not want LogoMaker to have this type of information, you may change a setting in the options area of the LogoMaker Reader and prevent any information from being sent to LogoMaker.</li>
	<li>We must have your Personally Identifiable Information in order for us to adequately provide you with the LogoMaker service.</li>
	<li>Note that by limiting information collection, LogoMaker may not be able to provide you the same functionality or features as otherwise available (if such functionality or features rely on this information).</li>
	</ul>
	Cookies
	<ul>
	<li>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.  Each web site can send its own cookies to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) most browsers only permit a web site to access the cookies that the same web site has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.</li>
	<li>LogoMaker may set and access our own cookies on your computer.  Information stored by LogoMaker in cookies may be associated with your Personally Identifiable Information in order to identify you as a repeat visitor or customer of the website, to maintain session information for logged in users, and to track usage trends and patterns in order to better understand and improve areas of our website.</li>
	<li>	LogoMaker may allow other companies or individuals that are presenting content on our site to set and access their own cookies on your computer.  Other companies' use of cookies is subject to their own respective privacy policies.  We do not have access to any information stored by third party advertisers about you.</li>
	<li>  LogoMaker may allow a third party to use cookies to track your activity on our website.  Such information will not be associated with your Personally Identifiable Information.</li>
	<li>  LogoMaker may also allow a third party to use cookies to allow the use of the Live Chat feature on the LogoMaker website. Such information will not be associated with your Personally Identifiable Information.</li>
	</ul>
	<span class="textSize4 grey">Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information</span>
	<br>
	In general, we will not disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to unaffiliated third parties without your express consent.  If we seek your consent to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to a third party, we will do so unambiguously, explaining precisely what information we seek to disclose, the entity to whom we wish to disclose it, and the purpose for the disclosure.
	<br><br>
	There are, however, some limited circumstances in which we may need to disclose Personally Identifiable Information about a user, and we want you to know about them:

	<ul>
	<li>We may employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, providing customer service, sending mail, processing credit card payments, or other functions necessary to our business.  We may need to share your Personally Identifiable Information to these companies.  However, we will provide them with only that information necessary to perform their functions, and will not allow them to use that information for any other purpose.</li>
	<li>Responses to requests for information necessary to provide you with the products you purchase or subscribe to through the LogoMaker service may contain Personally Identifiable Information.  LogoMaker will provide the authors of such products the information you supply in response to those requests.  The information practices of those publishers are not covered by this privacy policy.  Your name, address, phone number, and email address, will not be shared with the Authors.</li>
	<li>We may reveal a user's identity (or whatever information we know about that individual) if we believe that user is harming or interfering with other LogoMaker users, anyone else, or violating (either intentionally or unintentionally) our Customer Agreement or infringing any of LogoMaker's legal rights.</li>
	<li>LogoMaker will reveal information, including Personally Identifiable Information, to the extent it reasonably believes it is required to do so by law.  If we receive legal process calling for the disclosure of any of your personally identifiable information we will, if permitted by law, attempt to notify you via the e-mail address you supplied during registration within a reasonable amount of time before we respond to the request.</li>
	<li>LogoMaker may transfer information it collects, including any Personally Identifiable Information, in connection with a sale of all or most of the assets of the company.  Should your Personally Identifiable Information be transfered as the result of such sale, you will be notified via email.</li>
	</ul>
	<span class="textSize4 grey">Use and Disclosure of Anonymous Information</span>
	<ul>
	<li>Anonymous Information is any information collected from you or by the LogoMaker service, other than Personally Identifiable Information, including aggregate information derived from Personally Identifiable Information.</li>
	<li>LogoMaker may use Anonymous Information to improve the LogoMaker website and service, to monitor traffic and general usage patterns, and for other general business purposes.</li>
	<li>LogoMaker may disclose Anonymous Information to third parties for a variety of business reasons, including to publishers to inform them as to what content is appealing to their readers, to advertisers to inform them of the usage habits or characteristics of the interested audience, and to potential investors so that they may better understand LogoMaker's user base, etc.</li>
	<li>Anonymous Information will not include any Personally Identifiable Information and LogoMaker will not disclose any Personally Identifiable Information except as expressly stated elsewhere in this policy.</li>
	</ul>
	<span class="textSize4 grey">Changing or Removing Information</span>
	<ul>
	<li>LogoMaker wants to ensure that you have appropriate control over your Personally Identifiable Information.  You can change your Registration or Customer Information, by clicking <a class="highlight-terms" href="#">here</a>.</li>


	<li>If at any time you would like to delete your Registration Billing Information you can send an e-mail request to support@logomaker.com.  After receiving your request, such information will be deleted assuming (i) you are current with all payment obligations; (ii) LogoMaker does not believe it is reasonably necessary to keep such information for any pending legal action; and (iii) we are under no other legal obligation to retain such information.  If such information is deleted, however, any unfulfilled subscriptions will be canceled without refund and you will have to re-register with LogoMaker in order to use the LogoMaker service.</li>
	<li>Since Anonymous Information is by its very nature non-personally identifying, we have no way to locate Anonymous Information obtained by your use of the service.  In addition, Anonymous Information is often aggregated.  Therefore, we cannot remove Anonymous Information obtained from you or as a result of your usage of the website or service.</li>
	</ul>
	Security
	<ul>
	<li>We employ reasonable and current security methods to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information.</li>
	<li>Your personal data will be stored within a database that is located behind a firewall for added security.  The server housing the database is physically protected at a secure, third party site.</li>
	<li>No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be secure.  As a result, while we try to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</li>
	<li> Any transmission to the LogoMaker website or service of Personally Identifiable Information and credit card information uses SSL encryption.</li>
	</ul>
	Other Web Sites
	<ul>
	<li>This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by LogoMaker. Please be aware that we, LogoMaker, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

	We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.

	This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.</li>
	</ul>


	<span class="textSize4 grey">Children</span>
	<ul>
	<li>The LogoMaker service is not directed to children (persons under the age of 13), and we do not knowingly collect, either online or offline, personally identifiable information from children.</li>
	</ul>
	<span class="textSize4 grey">Changes to this Privacy Policy</span>
	<ul>
	<li>From time to time, LogoMaker may change its privacy policy.  If we make any changes regarding disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to third parties, then we'll send you an e-mail (or notify you by pop-up screen) prior to the date the modified policy takes effect.  We will also post conspicuous notice of the new policy on our home page.  Any new policy will have prospective effect only, meaning it will not apply to information previously gathered without your express consent.</li>
	</ul>
