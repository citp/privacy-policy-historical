  * Recurly: <https://recurly.com/security> and <https://recurly.com/legal/privacy>.



## Third Parties Who May Collect Information

The following third parties may collect information through the Site, but, except as set forth above, such information shall not include Personal Data unless you post or publish such Personal Data in areas of the Site accessible to other users or the public: 

  * third parties that help facilitate the Site may, from time to time, collect information through the Site in the course of providing support;
  * we may share Site information with partners for marketing purposes;
  * third parties may collect other information that you voluntarily post or publish through the Site in any way; and/or
  * web-crawlers such as Google or Yahoo may collect information through the Site.



The Site may contain links or references to other websites, including third party advertisers and other unaffiliated websites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of those websites or of advertisers on the Site, and you should read the privacy policies of each website you visit. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through the Site. 

## Online Advertising and Tracking

Elastic engages with third-party advertising networks on the Site. Ad networks may include third-party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties, and we encourage you to read their privacy policies, which may apply to these third-party programs. Ad networks allow us to target our advertising to users through demographic, behavioral and contextual means. After you visit our websites, these ad networks may continue to track your online activities over time across third-party websites or online services by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, identifiers, web server logs, web beacons and other methods. 

Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based or other do-not-track ("DNT") mechanisms, we do not respond to web browser-based DNT signals at this time. 

## Online Security

Elastic uses secure server technology because we want your Personal Data to be safe. Elastic will use commercially reasonable measures to safeguard Personal Data stored in our servers and databases against loss, theft, and unauthorized disclosure or use. Please be aware that no security measures are perfect, and Elastic is under no obligation to use such security measures. Furthermore, we cannot control the actions of third parties with whom you choose to share information. We are therefore not responsible for circumvention of any security measures by third parties or of any unauthorized access or use of your Personal Data made by third parties. Any disclosures that you make of your own volition to the Site or anyone else are made at your own risk. 

If you ask us to delete your Personal Data from our records, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to do so while retaining any record necessary to comply with a governmental authority or applicable federal, state, or local law. Even after removal, however, copies of your Personal Data may remain viewable in cached or archived pages or if other users have copied or stored such information. If you would like to contact us about the Personal Data you have submitted, please contact us at: [legal@elastic.co](mailto:legal@elastic.co). 

## Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on the Site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Data that you submit while on the Site. 

We use session ID and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following the directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. 

We set a persistent cookie to store your preferences so that each time you visit the Site you do not have to set your search preferences more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Site. 

## Your California Privacy Rights

If you are a resident of the State of California and would like to opt-out from the disclosure of your personal information to any third-party for marketing purposes, please e-mail us at: [privacy@elastic.co](mailto:privacy@elastic.co); call us at: (650) 458-2620; or send us mail to: 

Elasticsearch, Inc.  
800 W. El Camino Real, Suite 350   
Mountain View, CA 94040

## Amending and/or Modifying Your Personal Data

At your request, we will: (i) inform you of what personal information we have on file for you; (ii) amend or modify the personal information that we have on file for you; and/or (iii) remove personal information that you have provided to us, or that we have collected. You may do so by contacting us via e-mail at [privacy@elastic.co](mailto:privacy@elastic.co); provided, however, that we ask individuals to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, amended or removed before processing such requests, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes). 

Please be advised that, after you delete your personal information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems. In addition, we will retain and use your personal information as necessary to comply with our legal and accounting and auditing obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
