We take your privacy seriously.

 **What information we collect**

  * To create an account we require your email address, username, business or real name, location, and password.
  * For Client accounts we collect basic billing information, but do not store credit card details.
  * Users may also enter additional information to their profile such as bio and website.
  * We collect overall information on our users through Google Analytics



 **What we do with it**

  * We will use your email address to update you on site events such as new contests, or receiving a private message from another user. We will never share your email with any third parties. 
  * We will never share your business or real name; we use this to generate a basic contract to transfer the ownership rights of the logo from designer to contest holder when the contest prize is paid.
  * Your location, profile information, and contest information is viewable publicly on the site.
  * We use information generated form Google Analytics to learn more about site visitors, and to improve the site based on these findings.
