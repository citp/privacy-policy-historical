LogoGround.com does not collect personally identifiable information from you during your visit unless you offer such information when contacting LogoGround, creating an account or making a purchase.

When you sign up as a designer or when you make a purchase, you provide details such as your name, surname, email address etc. This information is saved in our database. Some of this information is optional. We do not share your personal or contact information with anyone, unless with your permission or when required to do so by law.

LogoGround will use your contact information only for communicating with you regarding your LogoGround account, your logos or your purchases. 

When you purchase a logo, your name, surname and email address will not be made available to the designer, unless you choose to make this information available. Your username will be made available to the designer, therefor choosing your email address as your username will reveal your email address to the designer.

Logos that you purchased from LogoGround as well as your company name may be shown in our client list and portfolio of past work, in any medium, unless you request exclusion by completing the exclusion form.

Designers who participate on LogoGround are not employed by LogoGround and we cannot control their use of client information. When you provide information to a designer or any other member of the site, you do so without any guarantee of privacy unless such guarantee is offered by the member themselves.

When you register as a seller on LogoGround you are required to supply your real name and surname for the purpose of copyright transfer in the event of a sale. Your name and surname will be displayed publicly. We require a working email address so that your account details and sales notifications can be delivered to you. And lastly we require payment information, such as a PayPal email address, so that proceeds from sales may be paid over to you. Your contact information will not be displayed publicly unless with your explicit consent. When a sale takes place LogoGround may share the seller's email address with the buyer.

As a registered user you will have access to email preference settings which specify under which circumstances LogoGround may email you.
