We collect statistics on the use of our applications and web sites, including but not limited to: pages visited, features used, terms searched for, title selections, reviews, ratings, payment history, device type, unique device data, operating systems, and content accessed or rendered to screen. We use this information to find bugs, pay royalties to intellectual-property owners, identify areas needing improvement in our user interface, and otherwise improve our products and offerings.

We take your privacy very seriously and implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. We use a secure server. All supplied credit card information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and encrypted into our payment gateway provider’s database.

For your convenience, we securely store billing information for easy reuse on future transactions, but you can edit and delete billing information at any time. (Certain order transaction records may be maintained for a period of time to comply with legal and accounting regulations.)

#### Cookies

We use web browser “cookies” to record information when you visit our sites. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser (if you allow) that enable the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.

We use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart, understand and save your preferences for future visits, and compile aggregate data about site traffic and interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. If you turn off cookies in your browser, you may be unable to use certain features of our sites.

Logos Research Systems, Inc. can also gather information from IP addresses, a number assigned to all devices participating in a computer network that uses internet protocol communication.

#### Affiliated Sites

We operate dozens of web sites and share accounts and information between them. Information you provide on any one of our sites may be available and used at our other sites. A list of our primary sites is online at [http://www.logos.com/websites](https://www.logos.com/websites).

### How We Use Information We Collect

#### Information Use

We use the information we collect from you to personalize your experience, to improve our web site and product offerings, to keep our websites safe and secure, to recommend products to you, to improve customer service, to process transactions you initiate, and to administer contests, promotions, surveys, and other marketing campaigns.

At times Logos Research Systems may make certain personal information available to strategic partners. We only work with reputable partners who will respect your communication preferences.

All our email subscriptions include clear instructions for unsubscribing. You may choose to unsubscribe from emails sent for marketing purposes or to tell you about new products.

Even if you unsubscribe, we may send you occasional one-time emails about your account. Emails are sent after you make a purchase (as receipts, and with instructions on downloading, etc.), to provide important technical/support information about our products, etc.

#### Agency

In certain transactions (particularly purchases of electronic books from some publishers) we are acting as an agent for the publisher, who is the seller in the transaction. When we act as the agent of another party in a financial transaction, the transaction is between you and the seller, and we may provide your order details to the seller.

#### Third-Party Services

From time to time, we may partner with third-party companies to provide essential services for website users. These companies may use information (not including your name, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, or billing information) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide you with a more customized user experience. If you would like more information about this practice (and your choices about not having this information used by these companies), please see the links below.

#### Clear GIFs (Web Beacons / Web Bugs)

Our emails may include tiny graphics that contain unique identifiers that help us detect if an email has been opened. We use this to judge the effectiveness of email marketing and to help us reduce unwanted/unread email.

#### Business Transitions

In the event Logos Research Systems, Inc. is sold to, merged with, or acquired by another company, or sells all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information may be among the assets transferred. In this case, you will be notified in advance by email or a prominent notice on our web site.

By using our site, you consent to our online privacy policy. We reserve the right to change our privacy policy at any time; if we change our privacy policy, we will post the changes to this page.
