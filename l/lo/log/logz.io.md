We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully and use it to make informed decisions.

We may collect the following types of information from or about you:

  * ##  **Personal Information**




Personal Information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort to identify an individual. We gather the following types of Personal Information:

  *  **Registration details** : When ordering or registering to our Services, we may collect certain information that can be used to identify you (as the Customer’s point of contact or as a User) such as: name, email address, postal address, phone number, user IDs and other relevant details which are relevant to the Customer. We may also use our trusted third parties to enrich the information associated with you.
  *  **Customer’s payment information** : In order for you to enjoy all of the functions which we offer, we collect payment information from you, including your credit card number and bank account details. Please note that your billing information, to the extent provided by you, is forwarded directly to a third party billing or clearing company engaged by us and is not kept by us.
  *  **Voluntary information** : We also collect information which you provide us voluntarily. For example, when you respond to communications from us, ask our support, communicate with us via email or share additional information about yourself through your use of the Services.
  *  **Device information** : We also collect specific types of connection details and information with regard to your device, software or hardware that may identify you, such as: online identifiers, device’s unique identifiers (e.g. UDID, MAC address), IP address and geolocation.
  *  **Forum Information:** As part of the Services, Users may communicate with other Users through the Website and upload content to our forums (“ **Forum Information** ”). Such Forum Information may consist of, for example, Users’ comments and tips for utilizing the Services, feedbacks, etc. We and other Users will be exposed to your username and any additional information you upload to the forum, including Personal Information. We recommend that you secure your anonymity and information so that you do not allow others to identify you. By uploading Forum Information, you represent that you have all the necessary consents and permissions from each identifiable individual referenced in your content to use their Personal Information as part of our Services.


  * ##  **Non-personal Information**




Non-personal Information is non-identifiable information that, when taken alone, cannot be used to identify you. As such, we are not aware of the identity of the user from which the Non-personal Information was collected.

  *  **Analytics Data** : Our servers automatically record certain information regarding the use of our Services. Such data may include information such as the website that a User was visiting before accessing our Services and other statistics related to our Services. We also perform statistical analysis on all of the data and metadata which is collected through our Services.



We use this information to administer the Services and analyze this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality. Such data is also used for troubleshooting errors and bugs as well as for research and analytics purposes about your use of the Services.  
For the avoidance of doubt, if we combine Personal Information with Non-personal Information (e.g. analytics data), the combined information will be treated as Personal Information as long as it remains combined.

  *  **Anonymous information** : We may anonymize or de-identify the information collected by the Services or via other means so that the information cannot, on its own, personally identify you. Our use and disclosure of such aggregated or de-identified information are not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation and for any purpose.
  * ##  **End-User Data**




By using the Logz.io Platform, we manage and analyze Customer’s logs and other data that are transmitted through our Customers’ platforms. This data may include records of operations of Customer’s applications and systems and other information relating to Customer’s employees’/ end-users’ activities (“ **End-User Data** “). It may also include data, logs, text, audio, video or images that a Customer or any User uses in connection with Customer’s account and any computational results that a Customer or any User derives from the foregoing through their use of the Product.

Such End-User Data is provided by the Customer (or its Users) and processed by us on our cloud computing servers. The Company provides such services as a “data processor”, acting under the sole direction of its Customers and Users.

Please note that End-User Data is exclusively controlled by the Customer, meaning that the Customer (or any Users authorized by the Customer to use the Logz.io Platform on its behalf), maintain ownership of their related End-User Data and determine their own policies regarding the content that is provided within the End-User Data, the access permissions and the retention of the End-User Data.

Here are some examples of End-User Data that may be recorded and processed when you use the Logz.io Platform (keep in mind that they are only examples and there may be others):

  * Digital files created or transmitted through User’s platforms, such as text files;
  * Contact directories (such as names and email addresses);
  * Device identifiers – such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address and other types of unique device identifiers relating to Customer’s and its users’ devices.
  * Non-personal Information (as defined below), including usernames, directory names, server names, share names, file names, configurations, logs related to the Company (e.g. event logs), browsing events and technical information provided by the Customer’s and its Users’ devices, etc.



Please note that such End-User Data may include Personal Information. If you (as a Customer or a User) provide to us or to third-parties acting on our behalf any Personal Information relating to other individuals (e.g. employees, end-users, etc.) in connection with your use of the Logz.io Platform, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
