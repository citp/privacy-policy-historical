# Privacy Policy -

Last Updated September 3, 2013

Loggly, Inc. (“Loggly”, “we” or “us”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information received from users of loggly.com (the “Site”). This Privacy Policy only applies the websites, services and applications included within “Services” and does not apply to any third-party websites, services, or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services.  Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meaning as in our [Terms of Use](http://www.loggly.com/terms/).  Please note that the term “you” also includes the company which is our customer and for which you are accepting these terms.

**Information Collection and Use**  
Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account if applicable) and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.

_Account Information_. When you create an Account, we will collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as Account name, name, email address, postal address, username, and phone number (“Personally-Identifiable Information”).  We may also collect certain information that is not Personally-Identifiable Information because it cannot be used by itself to identify you, such as zip code or the number of servers you have.

_User Data_. In order to perform our Services, we may also collect from you data that you have sent to us (“User Data”) via electronic means to Internet addresses that we provide to you. Such User Data may include records of operations of your applications and systems and other information relating to your actions. Such User Data provided to Loggly may or may not contain Personally-Identifiable Information of the User’s clients or customers. Loggly will never share your User Data with other Users or with any other third party. However, Loggly reserves the right to analyze User Data in order to provide its Services to you and improve its Services.

If you choose to create an Account through one of our third-party partners, we may use your e-mail address so that your identity can be authenticated through the third-party party. When the authentication is complete, we will be able to link your Account with the third-party account and access certain Personally-Identifiable Information, such as your name and email address, and other Personally-Identifiable Information that your privacy settings on the third-party account permit us to access.

_Cookies_. We collect certain information through the use of “cookies,” which are small text files that are saved by your browser when you access our Services. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you have logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage may also place their own cookies on your browser. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not include use of cookies by such third parties.

_Use of Services_. Our servers automatically record certain information about how a User uses our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to fight spam, malware and identity theft. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used. __

_User Support_. If you are a User with an Account, Loggly may occasionally send you an e-mail to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what is going on with Loggly and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support request or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish your request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other Users.

Loggly takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of Personally-Identifying Information.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**  
_Service Providers_. We may engage third party service providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your Personally-Identifiable Information only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf and are expressly obligated not to disclose or use your Personally-Identifiable Information for any other purpose. These third parties have access to your Personally-Identifying Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. Some of these service providers may be located outside of your home country; by using Loggly’s services, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Loggly will not rent or sell Personally-Identifying Information to anyone.

_User-to-User Forum_. As part of the Services, Users may communicate with other Users in a User-to-User forum (“Forum Information”). “Forum Information” may consist of, for example, User comments regarding and tips for utilizing the Services.  Such Forum Information may be collected and analyzed by Loggly for the purpose of providing the Services and supporting you or other users.  Other Users will see your “User Name” when you participate in a User-to-User forum. Providing other Users with any information on a User-to-User forum is voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction you want to have with the other Users.  We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information so that you do not allow others to identify you.

_Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement_. Loggly cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Loggly or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.

_Business Transfers_. Information that we collect from our Users, including Personally-Identifiable Information, is considered to be a business asset. As a result, if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy or if we are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your Personally-Identifiable Information may be disclosed or transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction.

_Publicity_. We may use your Personally-Identifiable Information for the purpose of solely identifying you as a Loggly customer on Loggly websites, client lists, press releases and/or other marketing documents. We may also use your Personally-Identifiable information for the purposes of publishing a brief description highlighting your use of our Services.

_Your Request_. We will share your Personally-Identifiable Information with third-party sites or platforms, such as social networking sites, if you have expressly requested that we do so.

**Security**  
We take precautions to ensure the security of your Personally-Identifiable Information. However, we cannot guarantee that hackers or unauthorized personnel will not gain access to your Personally-Identifiable Information despite our efforts. You should note that in using our Services, your information will travel through third party infrastructures which are not under our control. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personally-Identifiable Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. While we do not require Users to send their User Data to us via encrypted transit, we encourage all Users to do so.

We cannot protect, nor does this Privacy Policy apply to, any information that you transmit to other users of the Site. You should never transmit personal or identifying information to other users.

**Phishing**  
Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to us. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your company’s credit card information, account ID, password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website at http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0003-phishing.

**Modification**  
If you, as a User, would like to update, correct or delete the Personally-Identifying Information in your registration profile, you may do so by contacting us at [info@loggly.com](mailto:info@loggly.com). If you request a deletion of such information, your Account may become deactivated. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We have the right to retain an archived copy of your Personally-Identifying Information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.

**Privacy Policy Changes**  
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Loggly may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Loggly’s sole discretion. Any information that we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. Loggly encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you of such changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we will indicate when such changes will become effective. Your continued use of the Site and/or Services after we have notified you of any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.

**International Transfer**  
Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide your Personally-Identifiable Information to us, we may transfer your Personally-Identifying Information to the United States and process it there.  Your consent to this Privacy Policy, as represented by your continued use of the Site and/or Services, followed by your submission of any Personally-Identifying Information represents your agreement to that transfer.

**Our Policy Toward Children**  
Our Site is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personally Identifying Information, we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.

**Questions**  
If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [info@loggly.com](mailto:info@loggly.com).
