To send you an e-zine, we obviously need your e-mail address. However, our privacy policy is very simple: we will not ever rent or sell your name, e-mail address or other information about you to anyone else. Ever.

If you decide you want to stop receiving our e-zine, you can always "opt-out." The unsubscribe instructions appear in every issue of the e-zine and on the Web site.

Here's a list of the information we collect and how we use it.

  * Like most sites on the Internet, all Logical Expressions, Inc. Web sites automatically tracks certain general information about your visit so we know how many people visit the site, which browsers they are using, what Web page they came from, and which pages they visited on our site. This information helps us monitor customer traffic and site usage to help us improve the content, design, and layout of the site. When you visit Logical Expressions, Inc., our Web server gathers this information by tracing your domain name (such as aol.com, for example) but not your e-mail address. Note that none of this information is used (or can be used) to identify you personally. 
  * We use PayPal to process payments. So when you want to buy an ebook, software or otherwise pay us for something by credit card, PayPal will need your name, e-mail address, address, telephone number, and credit card information which we then use to fulfill your order and to deliver information to you regarding your order. 
  * Although PayPal collects your credit card information for payment, the information is kept strictly private and confidential. If you have questions on PayPal, please visit the [PayPal site](http://www.paypal.com/). 
  * Some of our advertisers may use cookies to track the fact that you clicked their link on our site. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.
