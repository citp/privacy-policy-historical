# The Free Online Logo Design Privacy Policy

We truly care about protecting your privacy. When you use Logomaker, you agree to the collection and use of some personal information as described below. Any future changes to our policy will be noted on this page.

When you create your account, Logomaker collects your email address, a password, and the pages on our site that you visit. If you make a purchase, we also collect credit card data (temporarily) and a physical address. For your security, we do not store credit card data after your purchase is completed. You do not need to provide a credit card number to use the site.

Your password is stored in encrypted form. No one at Logomaker can access it for any reason. If you lose your password, you can request a new one be generated for you.

We will never sell, rent, share, or give your personal information to anyone without your express permission, unless required by law. You have our word on that. We do send email notifications or receipts when you create, save or purchase a new logo. We may also send a regular newsletter, but you can easily opt out by clicking the opt-out link at the bottom of the email.

You can request that we delete your account at any time. This will delete your entire account and any artwork you have created. 

Logomaker links to several other websites and products. Any data you provide to other sites is not covered by this privacy policy.

If you have questions about this policy, please contact us at [support@logomaker.com](mailto:support@logomaker.com).
