    <strong>How We May Collect Other Information</strong>

</p>

<p>

    We and our third-party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:

</p>

<ul>

    <li>

        <strong>Through your browser or your device</strong>: Certain information is collected by most browsers, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, device type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system version, Internet browser type and version and the type and version of a Property that you are using. We and our service providers may also collect a unique device identifier assigned by us or our service providers to the device from which you are accessing a Property and other transactional information for the device that we and our service providers may use to serve content to the device.

    </li>

    <li>

        <strong>Through your use of Mobile Apps</strong>:&nbsp; When you download and use a Mobile App, we and our service providers may track and collect Mobile App usage data, such as the date and time the Mobile App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the Mobile App based on your device number.

    </li>

    <li>

        <strong>Through server log files</strong>: An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your device from which you are accessing a Property by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Property, along with the time of the visit and the activity on the Property.&nbsp; We and our service providers use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating Property usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, administering the Properties and determining your approximate geographic location.

    </li>

    <li id="adchoices">

        <strong>Using cookies</strong>: We and our service providers may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, Adobe Flash technology (including Flash Local Stored Objects ("<strong>Flash LSOs</strong>")) and other similar technologies to, among other things, better serve you with more tailored information for our products and services, and for those of third parties, facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Properties, and collect and store information about your use of the Properties.&nbsp; For example, pixel tags and web beacons may be used in connection with a Property to, among other things, track the actions of such Property's users, measure the success of marketing campaigns and compile statistics about such Property's usage and response rates.

        <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">

            <li>

                If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure on most devices through which the Properties are accessed that allows you to decline the use of cookies.&nbsp; To learn more about cookies, please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>.&nbsp; If you choose to decline cookies, then some or all of the features, functionality and promotions available through the Properties may not be available to you.

            </li>

            <li>

                If your device stores Flash LSOs, and if you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your device through which you access the Properties, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained using the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">Website Storage Settings Panel</a>. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html" target="_blank">Global Storage Settings Panel</a> and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your device without you being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).&nbsp; Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the Properties or our content. We expect our service providers and technology suppliers to honor any decision by you to restrict or limit Flash LSOs, but we cannot guarantee that they will do so.

            </li>

            <li>

                The use of these technologies allows our vendors and third parties and their vendors to deliver advertisements about our products and services, and the products and services of others, when you use the Properties or other applications or visit websites or web properties across the Internet. &nbsp;These parties may place so-called "pixel tags", "web beacons", "clear GIFs" or similar technologies on the device through which you access the Properties, and other applications or websites across the Internet, and also place or recognize third-party cookies when you use the Properties, or other applications, websites or web properties. These vendors may use information about your visits to the Properties, and other applications, websites or web properties (excluding your name, address, and telephone number) to provide advertisements for us and others about goods and services that may be of interest to you.&nbsp; If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">www.networkadvertising.org</a> or the Digital Advertising Alliance at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">www.aboutads.info</a>.

            </li>

            <li>

                Our Properties do not respond to browser-based do-not-track signals.

            </li>

        </ul>

    </li>

    <li>

        <strong>Geographic location information</strong>: If you use any location-enabled products or services, you may be sending us location information.&nbsp; When you use a location-enabled service, we may collect and process information about your precise geographical location, such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device.&nbsp; We and our third party service providers and partners may use your device's physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services, content and advertisements. In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses of your device's location, but if you choose to deny such uses, we may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content.

    </li>

    <li>

        <strong>From you</strong>: We may collect demographic information, such as your zip code or gender, as well as other information, such as your preferred means of communication, when you voluntarily provide this information to us.&nbsp; Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Properties.

    </li>

    <li>

        <strong>Information about how you interact on the Properties</strong>:&nbsp; We may collect information about how you interact on the Properties.&nbsp; For example, some Properties may utilize analytic tools to help us better serve you through improved products, services, and revisions to the Properties. This collected information may let us know which services and features you are using the most within a Property, as well as device type and hardware features, country and language of download, etc.

    </li>

    <li>

        <strong>By aggregating information</strong>: We may aggregate Personal Information so that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Properties, for example, by using Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who like a particular artist.

    </li>

</ul>

<p>

    &nbsp;

</p>

<p>

    <strong>How We May Use and Disclose Other Information</strong>

</p>

<p>

    &nbsp;

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

    &nbsp;

</p>

<p>

    <strong>SECURITY</strong>

    <br>

    <br>

    We seek to use reasonable physical, technical and administrative measures to protect Personal Information under our control.&nbsp; Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data security system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
