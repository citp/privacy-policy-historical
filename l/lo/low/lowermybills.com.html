</p><p><strong>Cookies and IP  Addresses</strong> <br>
  To serve you faster  and with better quality, we use "cookies" technology. Cookies are  small bits of code, usually stored on a user's computer hard drive, which  enable a Website to "personalize" itself for each user. We generally  use cookies to reduce the time it takes for pages to load on your computer and  to assist with customer tracking. We use both session ID cookies and persistent  cookies.&nbsp; A session ID cookie expires  when you close your browser.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most cookies are  "session cookies," which automatically delete themselves from your  hard drive after each session. Like many Web sites, We may automatically track  information based upon your behavior on Our Web sites. We may combine  information that We obtain through the use of cookies with Personal  Information, other aggregate or anonymous data, including a unique ID We may  assign you. As described above, We use this information for research purposes  to better understand, protect and service Our customers. The information We track  may include such information as browser type, Internet service provider (ISP),  referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, IP address and number of  clicks to analyze trends, administer Our Web sites, track user's movement in  the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.&nbsp; A persistent cookie remains on your hard  drive for an extended period of time. We use persistent cookies to store  information about your last visit, and to recognize return visitors. We also  use these cookies to store the traffic source or marketing campaign that  explains how you reached our site. You can remove persistent cookies by  adjusting your browser settings. Customer tracking (or  "click-stream") data collected by us is used to optimize your experience  by learning whether or not you successfully used LowerMyBills.com.  Additionally, we may capture click-stream data on some of our partner's  websites, limited to the activity involved with the completion of offers listed  on our website. This information is used to monitor the performance of our  partners. We also may use cookies to deliver targeted advertising on our  website, websites owned by our sister companies, or websites of third parties.</p>  
<p>We also keep track of  Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP Address is a number that is used by  computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the  Internet. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to  analyze trends, to administer the site, to track user's movements around the  site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>

<p><strong>Clear Gifs</strong> <br>
  We employ a software  technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons) that help us better manage  content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are  tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are  used to track the online movement of Web users. Clear gifs are not tied to  users' personally identifiable information. We also use clear gifs in our  HTML-based emails to let us know which emails the recipients have opened. This  allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the  effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of  these emails, please see the <a href="javascript:openUnsubscribeForm();">Opt-out </a>section  within any email you receive from us or unsubscribe from our homepage by  clicking <a href="javascript:openUnsubscribeForm();">here.</a></p>
<p>Our third party  partners employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts  that help them better manage content on our site. We do not tie the information  gathered to our Customers' or Users' personally identifiable information.<br> </p>
