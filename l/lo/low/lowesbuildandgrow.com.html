                information. Because our Web site will continue to implement new technologies and
                improve the services and features we provide, this policy is subject to change without
                prior notice. For that reason, we encourage you to review the privacy policy periodically.
                Registered users will be notified by e-mail of any material changes in either the
                scope of the privacy seal, the language of the privacy notice, or our information

                The type of information we gather online is summarized into six general categories.
                The following explains why we collect this information and how we use it.

            </p>
            <p>
                We keep track of the pages visited by each user. Our Web server automatically collects
                some information about you when you request pages from our server, including your
                IP address. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers connected to the
                Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the Web pages you request)
                can be sent to you.

                        address in order to make the checkout process faster. Your address will also be
                        added to our customer information database to allow Lowe's to research and offer

                When you register, you will also have the opportunity to sign up for e-mail newsletters
                on certain subjects. These newsletters will be sent to you only if you choose to
                place your name on our mailing list. In order for us to deliver these newsletters,
                we may need to pass your name and e-mail address to our service providers who supply
                us this e-mail service. We also use a third party company to authenticate and validate
                the information you provide to us. Your registration information is merged with
                information provided by the third party for our marketing purposes. The information
                you provide while visiting Lowes.com is combined with marketing research from internal
                and external sources. The information will be used to determine shopping and informational

            </p>
            <p>
                We have legally binding agreements with these service providers that prohibit them
                from using your information for any purpose other than what Lowe's instructs
                them to do with it. Therefore, if you sign up for the e-mail newsletters, you do
                not need to worry about receiving unsolicited e-mails from other companies as a
                result of Lowe's releasing your information.

            </p>
            <p>
                We understand that many consumers are concerned about security on the Internet.
                The Web server here at Lowes.com is designed for Internet commerce, and employs
                industry standard methods of protecting the security of information sent over the
                site. This statement describes the technologies we use and provides additional information
                about how we handle your credit card information. We want you to be able to shop
                at the Lowe's site with confidence. Of course, if you would rather order products
                by telephone, you can call us toll free at 1-800-44-LOWES (5-6937).</p>
            <p>
                <span style="color: #006600; font-weight: bold;">Is the Information I Send You Secure
                    While It Is Being Sent?</span></p>
            <p>
                We strive to protect the security of the information you send to us while it is
                en route to our site. Every page of the Lowe's site on which information is
                exchanged between you and Lowe's employs Secure Sockets Layer technology. Secure
                Sockets Layer, or SSL, is a secure and encrypted method of communicating between
                your browser software and our Web server. SSL is the most common method of secure
                communication used on the Internet, and SSL technology is built into most major
                browsers. When you provide information or place an order with us, the information
                is sent to us via this secure, encrypted SSL connection. A quick method of identifying
                a secure Web page is to look at the address of the page. Secure pages will usually
                appear with an address that starts with "https://" rather than the standard
                "http://".</p>
            <p>
                We provide links to Web sites outside of Lowes.com as an added convenience to the
                user. Any link included does not imply or convey endorsement of the other company
                or organization, its site or its products or services. We are not responsible for
                the privacy, terms of use or other policies of any other Web site.

            <p>
                <span style="color: #006600; font-weight: bold;">Is the Information I Am Sending Really
                    Going to Lowe's?</span></p>
            <p>
                We have also obtained a Verisign™ digital security certificate for Lowes.com. Verisign™
                is an independent third party that authenticates the identity of others on the Internet.
                By registering with Verisign™, we provide you a method of independently authenticating
                that the information you are sending is going to Lowe's.</p>
            <p>
                <span style="color: #006600; font-weight: bold;">What Happens to My Information After
                    You Receive It? </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                SSL protects information en route to us and the Verisign™ certificate confirms that
                we are the recipient of this information. How the information is handled after it
                arrives is every bit as important to maintaining security. Once you are finished
                shopping and you have typed in your shipping information, e-mail address and credit
                card information, and you have clicked "Submit Order," your encrypted
                information is sent to our server. All data collected is stored on site at and may
                be accessed by Lowe's, Lowe's subsidiaries and contracted third party service
                providers.</p>

            <p>
                We are committed to providing a secure, friendly site where customers can shop without
                undue concern over security. When we receive your information, we use commercially
                reasonable efforts, including the measures described above, to protect the security
                of your information on our systems. However, no data transmission over the Internet
                or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. Therefore, we
                do not warrant or ensure the security of any information sent to us online. If you
                have any questions, comments or concerns, please contact us via e-mail at <a href="mailto:manager@lowes.com">
