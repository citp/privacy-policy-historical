Our goal is to provide you with a safe and enjoyable experience when using our service. You can browse the LowerMyBills.com website at anytime without revealing any personal information about yourself. When we do ask you for information, it is used only for the following important purposes: to process and fulfill your requests for products and services; to solicit your opinions and other feedback; to conduct research; to customize the advertising and content you see; and to provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. LowerMyBills.com may collect personal information at the following times, with your permission only:

• When you register to receive communications from LowerMyBills.com   
• When you seek information or enter applications for products and services offered through LowerMyBills.com  
• When you enter promotions or sweepstakes offered by LowerMyBills.com  
• When you provide such information to us through surveys, feedback, or other forms hosted on LowerMyBills.com's   pages or the pages of certain LowerMyBills.com partner.

In addition, we might receive information about you from other sources (such as service providers) for tracking purposes. LowerMyBills.com may add the information we receive about you to your existing account. Like other websites, we also automatically receive and record certain types of information every time you visit us. We use "Cookies" and the other information to enhance your experience and present you with personalized offers. Likewise, we sometimes use third-party advertising companies to serve and track advertisements appearing on our website. These companies may employ cookies and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. 

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**  
LowerMyBills.com does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies. We share customer information only with your permission or under the following circumstances:

•   **Processing Your Requests:** If you apply for a product or service offered through us, we will share your information    with certain partners strictly to process and fulfill your request. ·   
•   **Contracted Partners:** We sometimes disclose the information we collect to companies that perform marketing    services on our behalf. These partners only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions,    and may not share it with others or use it for any other purpose. These companies are subject to confidentiality    agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit using the information except to market the specified    LowerMyBills.com products or services.  
•   **Legal Protection:** We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, and will establish or exercise our legal    rights and defend against legal claims. We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate,    prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the    physical safety of any person, violations of LowerMyBills.com's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.  
•   **Business Transfer:** As with any other business, it is possible that LowerMyBills.com in the future could merge with    or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to    the information maintained by LowerMyBills.com, including customer account information, but would continue to be    bound by this Privacy Policy unless you consent otherwise. 

**Anti-Spam Policy & Pop Up Windows**   
On occasion, you may receive advertisements for LowerMyBills.com from third parties. For instance, when visiting a third party website, you may receive a "pop up" window advertising LowerMyBills.com. Please note that such advertisements are served by the third party website that you have visited and are not controlled by LowerMyBills.com. In addition, you may receive emails that advertise LowerMyBills.com's services from third party publishers. LowerMyBills.com has established firm ground rules for dealing with any third party email services to ensure that advertisements for LowerMyBills.com are not sent out through a "Spam" mailing -- ensuring that our offers are sent only to those individuals who have given their permission to the third party email service to receive communications. If any third party email publisher refuses to abide by LowerMyBills.com's anti-Spam policy, LowerMyBills.com will not use that publisher's services. If you want to stop receiving emails from a third party, you should follow the opt-out instructions included in the email so that you will not be included in any future mailings. An "unsubscribe" link should appear at the bottom of the email you received. However if for any reason it does not work, please bring that to our attention by emailing us at [CustomerCare@LowerMyBills.com](mailto:customercare@lowermybills.com). 

**Cookies**   
To serve you faster and with better quality, we use "cookies" technology. Cookies are small bits of code, usually stored on a user's computer hard drive, which enable a Web site to "personalize" itself for each user. We generally use cookies to reduce the time it takes for pages to load on your computer and to assist with customer tracking. Customer tracking (or "click-stream") data collected by us is used to optimize your experience by learning whether or not you successfully used LowerMyBills.com. Additionally, we may capture click-stream data on some of our partner's websites, limited to the activity involved with the completion of offers listed on our website. This information is used to monitor the performance of our partners. 

**Confidentiality and Security**   
The security of your personal information is very important at LowerMyBills.com and we take a number of steps to safeguard it. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard personal information about you. We limit access to personal information to those employees and agents who assist us in providing requested products and services to you. In addition, we use industry standard data encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data on the LowerMyBills.com website. We have partnered with VeriSign to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we collect from you.

Please note that LowerMyBills.com can only control its own mailing list and policies. Third party advertisers that maintain their own mailing lists may send communications that advertise our services, and you may need to contact these parties directly in order to stop receiving such communications.
