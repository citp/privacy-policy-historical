This online privacy statement specifies what information is collected online, as well as how it is used. 

**What Personal Information is Collected?**

In general, you can visit many of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. The information we learn from customers, however, helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at lowepro.com. 

**Information You Give Us:**

Lowepro and its third party service providers receive and store personal information about you when you subscribe to a service, register to receive brochures, or participate in contests, sweepstakes and/or promotions. This information may include your name, shipping/billing address, telephone number, email address and credit card information. You may choose not to provide such information. 

**How is Information Used?**

Catalog Mailing List: If you provide your name and address, we will add you to our mailing list and we may send you our Lowepro brochures as a result of visiting our web site. If you prefer not to receive any of these brochures from us, please click [here](http://www.lowepro.com/support/contact-us). 

Sharing with Other Companies: We may share information with carefully selected Third Party Service Providers, vendors, business partners and other organizations who provide support services to us (such as a printer, mailing house, web host, order fulfillment, shipping, customer service, data management and promotional services) or that help us market our products and services. We provide these companies with the information needed for them to perform their functions.
