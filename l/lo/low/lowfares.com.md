# Lowfares.com - Privacy Policy

Information Collection and Use

**Information Collection**  
Lowfares.com Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on www.Lowfares.com. Lowfares.com Inc. collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.

Lowfares.com Inc. is **not responsible** for information collected from third party sites that the user may visit from using lowfares.com.  Please see each respective site's privacy policy to learn more about that site's regulations. 

Information Use

**Profile**  
We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that detail their viewing preferences. No personally identifiably information, such as name, email or phone number, is recorded or stored _without_   the user's explicit consent. Consequently, collected information is tied to the user’s personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user’s visit to our Web site and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We do not share your profile with other third parties. Your profile is shared in aggregate and anonymous form only. 

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. Information on cookies can be found here: http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm. 

By setting a cookie on our site, users can save their previous searches, as well as the site's they have already researched for prices. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. See the “Profile” section.

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. 

**Third Party Advertising**  
The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by Lowfares.com’s server and other relevant advertising partners, such as Linkshare, BeFree and Commission Junction. Information about users’ visit to this site, such as number of times they have viewed an ad (but not user name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to users on this site. For more information about these sites, please visit:   
• Linkshare: http://www.linkshare.com  
• BeFree: http://www.befree.com  
• Commission Junction: http://www.cj.com

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Lowfares.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party advertisers. 

**Sponsor Web sites**  
The offers that appear on this Web site are provided by travel related companies and websites. When a user clicks on a link to one of these companies, they are taken off our site and redirected to a sponsor’s site. Due to the nature of Lowfares.com Inc. it is impossible to list all of our sponsors and related information use policies. Lowfares.com Inc. is not in control or responsible for any of these sites or businesses.

**Log Files**  
Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**  
Our third party advertising company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to users’ personally identifiable information.

In addition, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section. 

Communications from the Site

  
**Newsletter**  
From time to time we may offer newsletters. As we add more newsletters, the user will have the option of joining other newsletters they find relevant. Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.

**RSS Feeds  
**Lowfares.com has created a proprietary system to provide users with free RSS feeds from a variety of different airlines.  The content within these feeds is the sole property of the respective travel company.  Lowfares is not responsible for the validity or accuracy of any external travel site offer displayed in these feeds.

**Service Announcements**  
On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature. 

**Customer Service**  
We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email.  We are not responsible for customer service related to a booking that takes place external of Lowfares.com.

Sharing

  
**Legal Disclaimer**  
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

**Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)**  
We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This might include reports and statistics on web visitation trends, membership trends and various offer trends. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.

**Sponsor Web Sites**  
Although the travel offers featured on our site are from third-party advertisers, we do not share or transmit any personal information to these sites. This is done to further ensure your privacy. To track bookings, we may pass a unique identifier that is only used by Lowfares.com Inc. to match you with the sale. This information is not made available to any other party. You might be asked to register with a third-party web site or business as a result. 

**Business Transitions**  
In the event Lowfares.com Inc. goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via emailprior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users’ personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.

**Choice/Opt-out**  
Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information. 

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying modifying their profile in the member’s area section of our web site.

Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party.

**Links**  
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Lowfares.com Inc, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

**Surveys**  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be shared with the contest sponsors] to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users’ personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users’ personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

**Tell-A-Friend**  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend’s name and email address. Lowfares.com Inc. will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Lowfares.com Inc. stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. The friend may contact Lowfares.com Inc. at remove@Lowfares.com to request the removal of this information from our database.

**Security**  
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.

**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
