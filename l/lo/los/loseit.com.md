# Lose It! - Privacy Statement

This Privacy Statement informs users of the Lose It! website and the Lose It! Connect iPhone application about how FitNow, Inc., trading as Lose It! ("Lose It!" or "we") gathers and uses personal information submitted to Lose It! and aggregated information collected from the Lose It! website or via the Lose It! iPhone application. 

### Collection of personal information

If you use the Lose It! iPhone application, you may enter data into the application running locally on your iPhone, in order to set, track and manage your diet and exercise goals. This data, your "Personal Diet Data", includes your birthdate, your height and weight, your gender, and specific details of the foods and drinks that you consume and the exercise you do. If you do not subscribe to Lose It! Connect or create an account at the Lose It! website, your Personal Diet Data will remain on your iPhone and we will have no access to it. 

If you subscribe to Lose It! Connect, you will be asked to provide your email address and to select a password. Subscribing to Lose It! Connect will automatically create an account at the Lose It! website under your email address and password, and your Personal Diet Data will automatically be synched to your website account. If you create an account at the Lose It! website, you will be asked to provide an email address and password, and you may enter Personal Diet Data into the website. 

In addition to the above personal information, we collect standard information about Lose It! users such as IP addresses, browser type, operating system, pages visited on our site, referring and exit pages, and the dates and times of the visits. This site visitation data is used to administer the site and provide general statistics regarding the use of loseit.com. Site visitation data is never linked to your personal information, and we do not use it to identify you individually. 

### Sharing information with friends and in user forums

The Lose It! website and Lose It! Connect feature allow you to share your diet and exercise goals and information with friends that you select. If you enable the sharing of Personal Diet Data with your selected friends, Lose It! will provide your friends with a summary of your Personal Diet Data. Please bear in mind that Lose It! cannot control what your friends do with the Personal Diet Data you share with them, so you should only share with friends you trust. 

Furthermore, if you participate in a user forum on Lose It!, your comments and your Lose It! username will be displayed to all Lose It! users on the forum. Lose It! is not responsible for what any user or third party may do with information that you choose to share. 

We also provide a feature allowing you to invite a friend to join Lose It! If you provide a friend's email address to us for this reason, we will use that email address only for the purpose of sending an invitation to your friend. 

### Use of personal information

We will treat your Personal Diet Data as confidential, and we will not share your personal information or Personal Diet Data with third parties without your permission, except in the limited circumstances described below. 

We will use the personal information you give us to fulfill the services and products you request from us. This may include billing and shipping of products that you order, sending information that you have requested, or contacting you about products and services that you have purchased. In some circumstances we may use third party contractors to perform these services on our behalf. In such circumstances, we will only provide the contractor with the information needed to perform the services (for example, name and address if a contractor is delivering a product to you), and all contractors will be required to agree to confidentiality obligations with respect to your personal, non-public information. 

If you do not opt-out of communications from Lose It!, we may send you marketing notices including promotions of our products and services. You can opt-out of communications from Lose It! at any time (see control of personal information below). 

We may disclose your personal information when we reasonably believe that it is required by a law or legal process and to protect and defend the rights and interests of Lose It!, its affiliates, suppliers, or users. In the event Lose It! goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information and Personal Diet Data will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. 

We may use and disclose Personal Diet Data, in a form that does not identify any individual, to allow Lose It! and our advertisers to present targeted advertising to you. We may disclose to third parties, including advertisers and potential business partners, aggregated statistics that we develop from Personal Diet Data. For example, we may disclose the total number of pounds lost by all Lose It! users, the average weight loss of Lose It! users, or generalized information about diet and exercise habits based on aggregated statistics developed from Personal Diet Data. This statistical information will not identify any individual. 

### Control of personal information

You can confirm, change, or update personal information you have provided to us by contacting us directly at [info@loseit.com](mailto:info@loseit.com) with your request. 

If you want to opt-out of communications from Lose It!, you can do so by emailing your request to [privacy@loseit.com](mailto:privacy@loseit.com). If you change your mind, you can opt-in again, by emailing this same address. When you opt-out of promotional communications from us, you may still receive service messages (such as an order confirmation) and legally mandated notices. 

### Security of the information we collect

We use a range of technologies and procedures to protect your personal information. For example, we store personal information and Personal Diet Information in a secure, limited access facility, and we use industry-standard firewalls and security software design to protect the security and integrity of your Personal Diet Information.
