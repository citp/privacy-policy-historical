## Users in the European Union

If you’re a user in the European Union, please note that LolSnaps.com is the data controller of your information. Here’s additional information we would like you to know:

##### Basis For Using Your Information

Your country only allows us to use your personal information when certain conditions apply or are met. These conditions are called legal basis. At LolSnaps, we rely on one of the following basis:

  * **Contract.** We may use your information because you’ve entered into an agreement with us. For example, when you buy our merchandise and have accepted our [Terms](https://lolsnaps.com/terms), we may use some of your information to collect payment and to make sure you receive the right product, at the right time, to the right address.
  * **Legitimate Interest.** We may use your information because we – or a third party – has a legitimate interest. For example, we need to use your information to provide, maintain and improve our services. This includes protecting your account, uploading your posts and comments, providing customer support, and showing the best content you’ll like. Most of these services are free. To keep the lights on at LolSnaps HQ, we may use this information to show you relevant ads. We believe legitimate interest does not outweigh your right to privacy, so we only rely on legitimate interest when we think the way we are using your data does not significantly impact your privacy.
  * **Consent.** We may ask for your consent to use your information for specific purposes. If we do, we’ll make sure you can revoke your consent in our services or through your device permissions at any time. Even if we’re not relying on consent to use your information, we may ask you for permission to access data such as your location.
  * **Legal obligation.** We may use your personal information when we are required to comply with the law, such as when we respond to valid legal process or need to take action to protect our users or employees.



##### Your Right To Object

You have the right to object to our use of your information. For some data, we’ve provided you with the ability to delete your data if you don’t want us to store or process it anymore. For other data, you can stop our use of your information by disabling the feature altogether. You can do these things on our site or in our apps. If you find other types of information you don’t agree with us using, please [contact us](https://lolsnaps.com/contact).

##### International Transfers

We may collect your personal information from, transfer it to, and process it in the United States and other countries outside of where you live. When we share information of EU users outside the EU, we make sure an adequate transfer mechanism is in place. For internal transfers, we rely on the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield.

##### Your Right To Complain

If you’re based in the EU and have a complaint, you can file your complaint with the supervisory authority in your Member State. For example, if you’re based in the UK, you can file a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office.

##### Children

Our services are not intended for anyone under 13. We don’t direct our services to anyone under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13. We may limit how we collect, use and store some of the information of EU users between ages 13 and 16. If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information and your country requires consent from a parent, we may require your parent’s consent before we collect and use that information

##### Revisions and Changes to the Privacy Policy

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will let you know by notifying you one way or another. We may let you know by revising the date at the bottom of this privacy policy, which is available on our website and mobile applications.
