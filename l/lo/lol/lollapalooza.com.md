### 12\. CHILDREN’S ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT (“COPPA”)

In addition to our general guidelines stated in this Privacy Policy, C3 recognizes the need to provide additional privacy protections for children under the age of 13. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under the age of 13.

OUR SITE IS NOT DIRECTED AT CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13 AND DO NOT KNOWINGLY COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13. CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13 ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO USE SERVICES ON OUR SITE THAT REQUIRE SUBMISSION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AND SHOULD NOT SUBMIT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO US. A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF 13 MAY USE THESE SERVICES ONLY IF WE RECEIVE CONSENT FROM A PARENT OR GUARDIAN.

**_How do we notify and obtain permission from a parent or any child under the age of thirteen for the collection of information from their kids?_**

If C3 receives actual knowledge that the site is being used by a child under the age of 13 C3 will obtain Parental Consent before collecting, using, or disclosing the child’s personal information. We obtain parental or guardian consent to collect information from a child under the age of 13 through the following process:

A parent may email us at [info@lollapalooza.com](mailto:info@lollapalooza.com) to provide consent provided the email contains a digital signature, or other digital certificate that uses public key technology. Please put “Parental Consent for Child’s Personal Information” in the subject line of the email.

**_If parental or guardian permission is provided how do we disclose personal information collected from a child?_**

The collection and use of personal information collected from children will be disclosed and used in the same ways described above in sections 1-10 of this Policy.

**_Do we ever disclose your personal information that we collect from children to third parties?_**

Our intention is not to disclose your information other than to our own employees and third party contractors who are bound by agreement with us to maintain the confidentiality of such information and who need the information in order for us to use the information as stated in this policy.

Before allowing a child to use a service of on our Site that might result in the public disclosure of the child’s information to third parties on the internet, we require a high level of verification to confirm that the parent has given permission for the child’s participation in such services. We may require a parent to provide us with credit card information, speak to a trained telephone operator, or return by postal mail or fax a signed consent form. Parents have the option not to consent to the disclosure of their child’s contact information to third parties.

**_Do we require any other information other than what we need in order for a child to participate?_**

No, we only require the minimum necessary.

**_May parents review the personal information we collect on that parent’s child, require us to delete the information from our records and/or correct the information and, if so, how?_**

Yes. Parents may review such information by emailing a request to C3 at [info@lollapalooza.com](mailto:info@lollapalooza.com). The parent or guardian, after receiving such information from us, may have it deleted and/or refuse to allow further collection by sending us an email at [info@lollapalooza.com](mailto:info@lollapalooza.com).
