This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their ‘Personally identifiable information’ (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website. 

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, feel free to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20180612184337id_/http%3A//lolsided.com/contact.php).

**What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our app?**  
We do not keep a record of personally identifiable information. Our app is built in such a way that storing Facebook user information in a database would be completely unnecessary. If you have taken any of our quizzes in the past, then you can rest assured that we have not kept a record of any of your personally identifiable information. 

**Third-party disclosure.**  
We do **NOT** sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. If you agree to provide us with access to your name, gender, etc, that information remains with LolSided.com and it is never transferred to a third-party.  


**Temporary PII storage.**  
Any personally identifiable information that is saved on our server is saved in a temporary session file that is automatically expired and removed within an hour of your session expiring.  
To manually expire your session, you can click on the "Log Out" button in the top right-hand corner of our app.  
If you forget to click on the "Log Out" button, do not worry, as all session data is automatically expired and removed after a short period of time.  
If we cache your profile picture for performance reasons, that profile picture is saved and named in such a way that it is not linked to the rest of your personal information.  
If we do cache your profile picture, it is for the sole intention of speeding up the time that it takes us to provide you with a quiz result.  
If you do not share any of our results, cached profile pictures are automatically removed from our server within an hour after they have been downloaded.  
If you do share one of our results, your cached profile picture may be stored for a longer period of time. This image is stored in such a way that it is not linked to your name or the rest of your personally identifiable information.  


**How do we use your information?**  
We use your information to provide you with personalized Facebook results. Example: By giving us access to your basic Facebook public profile information, you give us the ability to generate personalized quiz results that include your name, profile picture and / or gender. 

**Facebook permissions.**  
Our app abides by the Platform Policy for Facebook developers. Our app does not make any unnecessary requests for Facebook permissions. We only request data and permissions that our app requires to generate results.  
In most cases, we only ask for your basic profile information: This includes your Facebook profile ID, name, profile picture and gender.  
On quizzes that involve a member of your friend list, we will ask for the friend list permission.  
We do **NOT** ask for access to your interests, likes, timeline posts, photo albums or messages. 

**How do we protect visitor information?**  
We do not use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards. Currently, we do not use an SSL certificate because we do not process payments and we do not collect user information.

Yes.
