# Privacy Policy | LoungeBuddy

Effective date: April 21, 2015

Welcome to LoungeBuddy (“LoungeBuddy,” “we,” “us” or “our”). LoungeBuddy provides a fast, easy way to find airport lounges, explore amenities, understand access requirements, and share your airport lounge experiences with photos, reviews, and ratings.

Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection with LoungeBuddy services (collectively, the “Service”), and your choices about the collection and use of your information.

By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post content, including photos, comments and other materials (“User Content”), to the Service and to share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.

Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“Users”).

### INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We collect the following types of information.

 **Information you provide us directly:**

  1. Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for a LoungeBuddy account.
  2. Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone number). This information allows us to help you or others be “found” on LoungeBuddy.
  3. Payment details (including payment card number, security code, expiration date, cardholder name and billing address) if you are purchasing access to a lounge via the Service. § User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.
  4. Communications between you and LoungeBuddy. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note: you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.



 **Finding your friends on LoungeBuddy:**

  1. Note about “Invite Friends” feature: If you choose to invite someone to the Service, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on your device and send a text or email from your personal account. You understand and agree that you are responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is coming directly from your personal account, LoungeBuddy does not have access to or control this communication.



 **Analytics information:**

  1. We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.
  2. We do not track or respond to browser “do not track” requests.



 **Cookies and similar technologies:**

  1. When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use LoungeBuddy and provide features to you.
  2. We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.



 **Log file information:**

  1. Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.
  2. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.



 **Device identifiers:**

  1. When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by LoungeBuddy.
  2. A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.



 **Metadata:**

  1. Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.
  2. We may add or may have Metadata added to User Content including a hashtag, geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If your image has a geotag your photo, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature).
