# Lou Malnati's Pizzeria - Privacy Policy

Personally identifiable information collected  
We collect information about our users in two different ways, implicitly and explicitly. We learn about our visitors implicitly through the use of log files from our web site and e-commerce shopping cart. Additionally, we collect personal information in order to fulfill users' requests for additional information on our product line, and in the course of taking orders in our shopping cart.

When you order from us, we ask you to provide your name, company name, billing address, telephone number, email address, as well as credit card information. In addition, we request the name, company name, billing address, telephone number, and email address of the person you wish to ship your order to.

The log files of our e-commerce shopping cart and web site reports on visitor information like user IP address, browser, most popular pages, referring page, as well as information about operating system, browser versions, screen resolutions, and color settings. This information helps us optimize our site for the best user experience. In addition, our website uses cookies to store information about your shopping cart.

How we use this information  
Lou Malnati’s realizes that information about our customers is an important part of our business. As such, we are not in the business of selling customer information.

Information gathered in our e-commerce shopping cart is used to prepare, authorize, ship, and track your order.   
The information logged by our web site and e-commerce shopping cart is for the purpose of refining the content on our site to provide an enhanced user experience.

With whom we share this information  
We employ other companies in the course of providing customers with services and products that can be ordered through our web site. Examples include delivering packages, fulfilling orders, sending postal mail and email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments. These companies or individuals have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

The Lou Malnati’s site may contain links to other sites. Please remember that the privacy practices these sites uphold may differ from ours.
