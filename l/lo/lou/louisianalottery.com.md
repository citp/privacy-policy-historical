We will use automatically collected information to compile reports about popular pages and to see how users in aggregate are accessing our site. This information will help us to continue to improve the usability of our site so that users have a better experience when visiting our website. For example, if you visit our website via a mobile phone, you are directed to the mobile version of our site for a more device-friendly experience.

When you participate in various features of our website or Facebook Page, including sending the Lottery an email, accepting/downloading the Louisiana Lottery's Facebook "Contest Promotions" Application or entering a promotion via that application, you are voluntarily providing personally identifiable information. Participation in these features is strictly voluntary. Should you choose not to provide your personal information in these instances, it may limit your ability to fully participate in various features of our website or the Lottery's Facebook Page.

 **How This Information is Used**

Personal information collected and maintained with Club Lotteaux membership is used to verify that the potential member is of the required age to participate. (See note about age requirement below.) Information about an individual's residence and game preferences is also used to customize Club Lotteaux pages with news and events most relevant to them. Email addresses will be used to communicate with members on an ad hoc basis and to fulfill their requests to participate in Club Lotteaux email lists. Changes to voluntarily collected information can be made by the user through the Change Profile feature of the site.

 _Filling out a Survey_  
Personally identifiable information may be collected and used for marketing and product development purposes. Since drawings are sometimes held from among survey participants, personal information may be used in order to contact prize winners.

Personal information in your Facebook profile is collected when you download or accept the Louisiana Lottery's Facebook "Contest Promotions" Application (such as date of birth, phone number and address). This information is used to verify participants meet age and residency requirements as well as to contact contest winners. The information collected may change from time to time to allow the Lottery to better serve or market its services to its Facebook fans. When first accessing the App, you will be presented with a Facebook permissions page that advises you what Facebook profile information will be collected from you. You can then decide whether or not to share your Facebook information by accepting or not accepting the App. If you decide not to grant permission, you will not be able to use the App or participate in Lottery Facebook promotions. As a registered Facebook user, you are also subject to Facebook's Privacy Policy. Please check your Facebook account privacy settings for further information.

After downloading/accepting the Louisiana Lottery's Facebook "Contest Promotions" Application, you are allowed to enter contests and promotions the Lottery sponsors from time to time on its Facebook Page. When entering these contests, additional information may be voluntarily collected from you in order to determine contest eligibility or judge the contest according to its specific rules.
