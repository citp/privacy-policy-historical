We take reasonable steps to protect our User’s information. Nevertheless, please note that no data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be totally secure. As a result, whilst we strive to protect our User’s information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information which they send to us, and the Users do so at their own risk.
