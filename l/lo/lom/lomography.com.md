###  Data of Cookies, Analytics and Tracking Pixels 

The collected data is transferred to the respective service provider in the European Union, Switzerland, or the United States, where it is stored and evaluated. The terms and conditions for carrying out data processing are subject to strict contractual obligations, in which the parties agree on data protection and information security requirements. Our service providers are only able to process data on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions. 

Your IP address will be collected for Google Analytics and Criteo Dynamic Retargeting in pseudonymous form, which is a non-precise information related to your geography and derived from the truncated IP address of your connection. It will be collected in order to serve you ads only for products and services available in your country, region or city. This makes only a rough geo-localisation possible. Your full IP addresses may only be used by Criteo for fraud detection purposes, sales attribution, and marketing reports with aggregated data. 

The Facebook Pixel collects your full IP address with each call-up of our site. However, any customer data you pass through the Facebook pixel is hashed locally on the browser before it goes to the Facebook servers for matching. This hashing process turns your data into short encrypted messages that cannot be tampered with. They use these hashes to match pixel events with people on Facebook. Then Facebook deletes all matched and unmatched hashes immediately after the matching process ends. They do not collect or store any personally identifiable information on their servers. The Facebook pixel uses secure https connection, so that any data transmitted from the browser will make it to their servers safely. 

Data processing is according to legal requirements of § 96 Abs 3 TKG 2003 and Art 6 para 1 lit a (consent) and/or lit f (legitimate interests) of the EU-GDPR. Our legitimate interests for the purposes of this regulation are improvement of our products, services and online presence.

We delete this data six months after our vacancies are filled in accordance with the Equal Treatment Act (GlBG). We cannot estimate the exact time period until a vacancy is filled, but we will consider this period over when a candidate bindingly accepts our offer for the position for which we are considering you. When that period is over, we will either delete your data or inform you that we will keep it in our database for future roles.

You will not receive unsolicited marketing emails from this third party partner, and we will not share your email address with anyone else without your prior consent. The emails lists we pass to Facebook will be hashed to turn your data into short encrypted messages that cannot be tampered with. Facebook does not collect nor store any email information on their servers.
