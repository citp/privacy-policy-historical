In  addition, you may also be asked to provide your country of residence so we can  comply with applicable laws and regulations. These kinds of personal  information are used for billing purposes, to fulfill your orders, to  communicate with you about your order and this site, and for internal or  third-party marketing and promotional purposes.

This information is used to analyze trends, administer  our web site, track users' movements through our web site and gather  demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports  based on these technologies on an individual or aggregated basis<br>
            2.1.1 Cookies: "Cookies" are a feature in your browser software. If  enabled, cookies store small amounts of data on your computer about actions you  take on the pages of our web site. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our  features you visit most often, and what content you viewed on past visits. When  you visit this web site again, cookies allow us to remember your settings and  may be used for authentication. We may use cookies to keep track of the number  of return visits, accumulate and aggregate statistical information generally  pertaining to our web site, and deliver specific content to you based on your  past viewing history.

            2.1.2 Third-Party Cookies: We allow third-party vendors and advertisers to set  their own cookies on and through our web site. We have no control over the  practices of those third parties and are not responsible for their technology  or tracking. We encourage you to review the policies of such persons or  entities on their web sites. We use AdWords Remarketing through Google, which  is a remarketing and behavioral targeting service provided by Google LLC that  connects the activity on our web site with the AdWords advertising network and  the DoubleClick cookie.

        <p>7.1 We  retain personal information regarding you or your use of the services for as  long as your account is subscribed to our services or for as long as needed to  provide you with our services and warranties. We also retain personal information  for as long as necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Privacy  Policy; for example, to comply with our legal obligations, to protect us in the  event of disputes, to enforce our agreements, and to protect our and others’  interests.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>  The  precise periods for which we keep your personal information vary depending on  the nature of the information and why we need it.

PRODUCTS ARE SOLD AND DELIVERED TO YOU "AS  IS" WITH NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED OTHERWISE IN  THIS SECTION, WE MAKE NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS AND WE DISCLAIM  ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND  NON-INFRINGEMENT, BINDING ARBITRATION, AND CLASS-ACTION WAIVER.<br>
            a. If you are a customer in the United States (including its possessions and  territories), you and we agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising  out of or relating in any way to the use of our site or sale of our products,  these Terms and Conditions of Use, and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be  determined by binding arbitration or in small claims court. Arbitration is more  informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead  of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is  subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same  damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to these  Terms of Service, the <em>U.S. Federal Arbitration Act </em>governs the  interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and we are each  waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This  arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the  termination of your account with us.<br>
            b. If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claim court action, you  must first send us, by certified mail, a written Notice of your claim  ("Notice"). The Notice to us must be addressed to: Lombardi  Publishing Corporation, 350 5th Avenue, 59th Floor, New York, NY 10118  ("Notice Address"). If we initiate arbitration, we will send a  written Notice to the e-mail address used for your membership account. A  Notice, whether sent by you or us, must (a) describe the nature and basis of  the claim or dispute, and (b) set forth the specific relief sought  ("Demand"). If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim  within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or we may commence an  arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court.<br>
            c. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the  Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA  Rules") of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), as modified by this  Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and Forms are  available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by  writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this  Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues  relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement. Unless  we and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the  county of your residence.<br>
            d. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR  OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY  PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we  agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's  claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a  representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be  unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null  and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in  favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary  to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.</p>
