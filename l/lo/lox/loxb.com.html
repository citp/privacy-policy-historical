	<h2>Privacy Policy </h2>
        <div>
          <p>loxb Online Privacy Policy</p>
          <p>Thank you for visiting loxb. Your privacy is important to us. To  better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our  online information practices and the choices you can make about the way  your information is collected and used at this website and in the  loxb service.</p>
          <p>The information we collect</p>
          <p>At loxb’ web site, you can order products, enter contests, vote  in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our  services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our  online forums or communities. The types of personally identifiable  information that may be collected include: name, address, e-mail  address, telephone number, credit card information, and information  about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and  services.</p>
          <p>You can also submit information about other people. For example, you  might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic  greeting card, to send a link or message to a friend about loxb  products or services, or the site, or other material, and, if you order  a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might  submit the recipient's name and address. The types of personally  identifiable information that may be collected about other people  include: recipient's name, address, e-mail address, telephone number….</p>
          <p>At certain parts of our site, only persons who provide us with the  requested personally identifiable information will be able to order  products, programs, and services or otherwise participate in the site's  activities and offerings.</p>
          <p>We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information  when you visit many of our web pages or when you utilize the loxb  service, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape,  Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g.,  Windows 'XP, Vista or Mac OS…) the domain name of your Internet service  provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink…), your activities while  visiting our web pages, and your activities while using the loxb  service (e.g., which of our web pages you viewed, or which games within  the loxb service you played, etc.). Functions within the loxb  desktop application will automatically transmit this data back to us on  a regular basis.</p>
          <p>How we use the information</p>
          <p>We may use the information you provide about yourself and any other  information we collect about you to fulfill your requests for our  products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about  our offerings (including, without limitation, customer service  inquiries), and to offer you other products, programs or services that  we believe may be of interest to you. We assume that any information  that you provide us in connection with loxb service, including any  account and sign-up information, is both accurate and truthful. loxb  cannot and will not be held responsible or liable for any  misrepresentation or inaccuracy contained in or resulting from  information that you provide.</p>
          <p>We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as  to notify you when you have won one of our contests or when we make  changes to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for  customer service assistance, for an online newsletter, or to contact  you about your account with us.</p>
          <p>We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to  send them your gifts, messages, or cards. From time to time, we also  may use this information to offer our products, programs, or services  to them.</p>
          <p>The information we collect in connection with the loxb service  and our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive  experience. We use this information to facilitate your participation  and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services.</p>
          <p>If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., a "letter to  our editors"), we may publish your screen name and other information  you have provided to us.</p>
          <p>We sometimes use information that we collect to improve the design  and content of our service and to enable us to personalize your  experience with us. We also may use this information in the aggregate  to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or  services.</p>
          <p>We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to  legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.  We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement  agency's request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate,  prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud,  situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any  person, violations or our terms of use, or as otherwise required by  law. In addition, we may transfer information about you if we are  acquired by or merged with another company.</p>
          <p>Agents and contractors of loxb who have access to personally  identifiable information are required to protect this information in a  manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, for example, not  using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the  services they are performing for loxb.</p>
          <p>Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against  unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that  personally identifiable information that we collect will never be  disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice.</p>
          <p>Provided you haven’t opted out of the “Email me about loxb’s  Partner or 3rd party special offers” option, either upon registration  or thereafter, loxb may disclose personally identifiable information  to companies whose practices are not covered by this privacy notice  (e.g., other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory  databases, and non-profit organizations) that may want to market  products or services to you. We may on occasion combine information we  receive online with outside records to enhance our ability to market to  you those products or services that may be of interest to you.</p>
          <p>Cookies and web beacons</p>
          <p>To enhance your experience with our websites and the loxb  service, many of our web pages use "cookies" and "web beacons." Cookies  are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your  preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address  or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to  provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one of  our sites. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally  identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data  stored in the cookie. We use cookies to understand site usage and to  improve the content and offerings on our sites. For example, we may use  cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages ( e.g., to  recognize you by name when you return to our site), save your password  in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on  our sites. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or  services.</p>
          <p>"Web beacons" or clear .gifs are small pieces of code placed on a  web page to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors  viewing a web page. For example, web beacons can be used to count the  users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a  visitor viewing that page. We may use web beacons on our sites from  time to time for this and other purposes.</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.gametap.com/privacy-policy.html#"></a></p>

          <p>loxb website may contain links to other sites whose information  practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other  sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is  submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.</p>
          <p>loxb website sometimes may offer content (e.g., contests,  sweepstakes, or promotions) that is sponsored by or cobranded with  identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third  parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors  voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. loxb has no  control over these third parties' use of this information. The loxb  site will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable  information if these third parties will obtain such information.</p>
          <p>loxb website may use a reputable third party to present or serve  the advertisements that you may see at its Web pages. These third party  ad servers may use cookies, web beacons, clear .gifs or similar  technologies to help present such advertisements, and to help measure  and research the advertisements' effectiveness. The use of these  technologies by these third party ad servers is subject to their own  privacy policies and is not covered by our privacy policy. For more  information on such third-party ad servers, please see the section  below, entitled "Third-Party Ad Servers".</p>

          <p>Special note for parents</p>
          <p>Visitors to loxb's website may participate in activities without  providing any personally identifiable information. However, if a user  wants to receive emails from loxb, or wants to access loxb's  broadband gaming network, we ask the user to provide us with personal  information, including name, screen name, e-mail address, gender,  and/or age information. If a visitor to loxb's website  self-identifies as under 13 years of age, we will either collect no  personally identifiable information from that individual, inform the  child that a parent's verifiable consent is required, or we will  collect the e-mail address of the user's parent in addition to the  user's e-mail address. We use the parent's e-mail address to seek the  parent's verifiable consent or notify the parent of his/her child's  online activities and enable the parent to unsubscribe his/her child  from a newsletter or other similar activity. For children joining the  loxb service, we will ask parents to create sub accounts and obtain  their prior consent prior to collecting personally identifiable  information from their children. If a user is under 13, we will not  condition his/her participation in an online activity on the disclosure  of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the  activity. We do not share children's personally identifiable  information with outside third parties not bound by this privacy notice  for their own marketing purposes.</p>
          <p>Please send a letter or postcard to our Privacy Manager at the  mailing address provided below if you would like to review any of the  personally identifiable information we have collected online from your  child, or if you would like to do any of the following:</p>

          <p>* request that we no longer collect or maintain such information.</p>
          <p>Please be sure to include your e-mail address and a telephone number  where we can reach you. To protect your child's privacy and security,  we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting  you access to the personal information that we collect and maintain  about your child.
