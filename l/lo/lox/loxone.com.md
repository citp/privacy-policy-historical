### 1\. DATA CONTROLLER

Loxone Electronics GmbH, Smart Home 1, 4154 Kollerschlag, Austria (office@loxone.com) is the office responsible for the collection, processing and use of your personal data.

If you wish to lodge a complaint concerning the collection, processing or use of your data by Loxone, whether relating to the regulations for data protection generally or to more specific cases, this can be done by email, fax or by post. Your personal data will then be deleted, provided that no legal obligation exists to keep them if you have made a valid cancellation claim, if the data are no longer necessary for achieving a target which constitutes the aim of the data storage itself, or if the storage of your data is otherwise legally inadmissible.

### 2\. COLLECTION, PROCESSING AND USE OF PERSONAL DATA

#### 2.1 Personal Data

Personal data are details concerning factual or personal conditions pertaining to an identified or identifiable physical person. This includes, for example, your name, your telephone number, your signature, as well as numerous inventory data which you share with us upon opening a customer account with us.

#### 2.2 Customer Account

In order to shop with us, you require a customer account. This customer account comprises personal data. These are stored in our data bank for later processing when logging in.

#### 2.3 Collection, processing and use of your personal data

Data protection is an important concern for us. Therefore, when collecting, processing and using your personal data, we strictly adhere to the legal provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation _[Bestimmungen der Datenschutz-Grundverordnung]_ ( GDPR _[DSGVO]_ ) and the Telecommunications Act _[Telekommunikationsgesetzes]_ (TKG).

We comply with the principle that data collection is for a specific purpose and collect, process and store your personal data only for the smooth completion of your purchase, potentially including later guarantees for our services department, technical administration as well as our own marketing goals. Your personal data are only forwarded to third parties or otherwise given over if this is necessary to the completion of the contract or the invoice or upon your prior consent. In the context of order processing, the service providers we use (e.g. suppliers) receive the necessary data. The forwarded data may only be used by our service providers in order to perform their task. Any other use of this information is not permissible and would not occur with any of the service providers appointed by us.

For your order, we require your correct name, address and payment details.  We require your email address in order to confirm the receipt of your order with you and in order to communicate with you. Moreover, we use this for your identification (customer log-in). We also take data protection within the company most seriously. Our colleagues and our appointed service providers (e.g. suppliers) are bound to secrecy and adherence to the terms of the data protection law.

#### 2.4 Use of your data for advertising purposes

Alongside the processing of your data in order to complete your purchase with Loxone, we also use them in order to communicate with you regarding your order, certain products or marketing campaigns and in order to recommend products or services to you, which could be of interest.

You can always object to the use of your personal data for advertising purposes, whether in general or pertaining to individual cases. This can be done by contacting us in any way mentioned under point 1 (e.g. email, letter).

2.5 Infomail/Newsletters

In order to send our infomail/newsletters we operate a so-called double opt-in process. This means we will only send you our infomail/newsletters by email if you have previously expressly confirmed that we should activate our infomail/newsletters service. We will then send you a notification email and ask you to confirm that you wish to receive our infomails/newsletters by clicking one of the links provided in this email. If you later no longer wish to receive infomails/newsletters from us, you can always cancel this subscription. This can be done by contacting us in any of the ways mentioned in point 1. Of course, you will also find an unsubscribe link in each infomail.
