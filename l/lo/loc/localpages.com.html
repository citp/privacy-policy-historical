					  <li><em><u>Usage Information.</u></em> Certain usage      related information regarding your use and interaction with your device,      including the Software &amp; Services and Other Software, such as when and      how you Use the Software &amp; Services and Other Software, how you use      your internet browser and internet search related applications, the web      pages you visit and the content you see, access and utilize on such web      pages; for example, offerings and advertisements that you view, use and      access, how you use them and your response to them, how frequently you use      them, your search queries and the time and date of your searches;</li>
					  <li><em><u>Social Networks.</u></em> Your      interactions on social networks through the Software &amp; Services;</li>
					  <li><em><u>Registration Related Information.</u></em> Information you      provide when you register for the Software &amp; Services (if applicable),      such as name, home or work addresses, email address, telephone and fax      numbers, birth date and gender; and</li>
					  <li><em><u>Support Related Information.</u></em> If you      communicate with us via our support section or via email, we may also      collect your email address, name and any information voluntarily submitted      by you in connection with such support (for example, your name, company      name, and particular support query or request). Such information will only      be used to provide you with support services and will not be connected      with any other information collected from you on or through the Software &amp;      Services, including, any individual User ID (as defined below) generated      or collected by us.</li>
					</ol>
				<p>
					When you Use the Software &amp; Services, we automatically generate an anonymous internal user ID (which does not personally identify you), which is assigned to your use of the Software &amp; Services (the "User ID") and may be combined with any of the above information.

					While it is not our intention to collect any personally identifiable information (“PII”) (except for registration and user support purposes as set forth in this Privacy Policy), the data collected may include PII. As part of our privacy measures, we implement certain rules designed to avoid the unintentional collection of PII such as email addresses, social security numbers, credit card numbers, login information, etc. Such rules are based on known field types, parameters, values and algorithms but they are not foolproof and hence the Software &amp; Services may sometimes, unintentionally, collect unwanted information. We regularly examine and update these rules.

				<h3>Children under 13</h3>			
				<!-- description-paragraph -->
				<div class="description-paragraph">
					<p>
						 The Software &amp; Services are not intended for users under the age of 13 and you hereby represent that you are at least 13 years old. We do not knowingly collect, use, share or disclose any personal information from children under the age of 13. We reserve the right to request proof of age at any stage, so that we can verify that minors under the age of 13 are not using the Software &amp; Services.

						 In the event that it comes to our knowledge that a person under the age of 13 is using the LocalPages Software, we will prohibit and block such a user from accessing the Software &amp; Services, and will make all efforts to promptly delete any PII with regard to such user, as applicable.

						 If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child has submitted his or her PII without your consent, please contact us as provided in this Privacy Policy and we will take the necessary steps to remove that information from our database..
					</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Access</h3>
			<!-- description-paragraph -->
			<div class="description-paragraph">
				<p>
					You may send us a request to access the PII that we collect through your use of the Software &amp; Services. In such case, we may require that you provide us with additional information to verify your identity.
				</p>
			</div><!-- description-paragraph -->
					<h3>Data Retention</h3>			
				<!-- description-paragraph -->
				<div class="description-paragraph">
					<p> 
						We retain the information we collect as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as necessary to fulfill our business and/or operational purposes or comply with a legal request.

					</p>
					<h4>Transfer of Data Outside Your Territory</h4>
					<p>
						The Software &amp; Services work over the Internet. We may store and process information in various locations throughout the globe.

					</p>
				</div>			
				<h3>Information Security</h3>
			<!-- description-paragraph -->
			<div class="description-paragraph">
				<p>
					We implement measures to secure your PII that we collect in order to minimize the risks of damage, loss of information, and unauthorized access or use of information. However, these measures are unable to provide absolute information security. Therefore, although we make efforts to secure your PII, we cannot guarantee and you cannot reasonably expect that the Software &amp; Services and its databases are immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unauthorized interceptions, access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse.	
				</p>
			</div><!-- description-paragraph -->
					<h3>Do Not Track</h3>			
				<!-- description-paragraph -->
				<div class="description-paragraph">
					<p> 
						Do Not Track is a privacy preference that can be configured in certain web browsers (the "DNT Feature"); the DNT Feature, when enabled on a web browser, signals the websites you visit that you do not want certain information about the websites visited collected. As the Internet industry is in the process of defining how to interpret signals sent by the DNT Feature, LocalPages does not currently respond or recognize DNT Feature signals.
