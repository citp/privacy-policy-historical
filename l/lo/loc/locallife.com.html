<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<ul>

<li>Optional preferences enable us to deliver content 
  that is relevant to you 
  

</li><li>Preferences or contact information will not be shared 
  without your consent 
  

</li><li>Your information is protected by state-of-the-art 
  security software 
  

</li><li>You have the ability to access, change and delete your stored information</li>

</ul>

<p>Your privacy is very important to us. Unisys is committed to protecting your online privacy while providing you with the most
useful and enjoyable Web experience possible. Recognizing the growing concern over privacy on the Internet, Unisys
adheres to a policy of full disclosure regarding the type of information
obtained, how it is obtained, who uses it, how it is used and how customers can
restrict the use of that data. The only information Unisys obtains about customers of, and visitors to, the
locallife.net site is information supplied by the user for a specific
purpose. As part of the Unisys Community Portal registration process, we ask for contact information and
personal preferences (collectively “profile information”) that will help us
customize the appearance of the web site to meet your needs. We may also occasionally ask for preferences
during your visits to the site or during your attendance at online community
events. While establishing your preferences is optional, a personal profile will help us serve you better.</p>


<p>If you are like most Web users, you’ve learned to be careful about providing
personal information such as your e-mail or postal addresses. No one enjoys
receiving unsolicited e-mail about subjects that are of no interest. <b><i>You can rest assured that we will not
share any personal information with another party without your explicit consent</i></b></p>


<h1>How we collect and use personal information</h1>

<p>The goal of locallife.com is to be your favorite destination
on the Internet by providing you with the information, services and product
offerings that are most relevant to you. Subscribing to the Unisys Community Portal Site provides you with access
to all of the site’s information and features. The only information required is
your name, e-mail address, credit card information, and mailing address. With your permission we may use your profile
information to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Send you information on the Community Portal 
  

</li><li>Send you notices about events, products, services or 
  special offers 
  

</li><li>Let merchants and other entities hosted on our site send you notices about events,
products, services or special offers</li>
</ol>

<p'>Occasionally, we will send you e-mail to notify you
 about important changes to the site, new Unisys services, and special
 offers from the Community. If you prefer not to receive this information, simply indicate this when you register
 for the Community or modify your profile information


 at anytime.        
          
          
                 
                 
          <p>


</p>            
         
             
    <p>


With your permission, we may

 occasionally make your information available to specific
 merchants and other entities hosted on the Community Portal that provide products
 and services that seem to be oriented to your
 preferences. As a condition of hosting merchants and other entities on our site, Unisys
 requires these entities to comply with this Privacy Policy. We will



 never make your profile information

 available to anyone outside of Unisys or our
 merchants and other entities hosted on the Community Portal.   
                       
            
               
                
           
           
                   
              
          
     </p>


<p>While we will carefully

 comply with your elections for the distribution
 of profile information, we may collect and distribute aggregate statistics about Community Portal subscribers,
 traffic patterns, and related site information. These

 statistics will not include information that would identify any 
individual.</p>
<h1>Access to your profile information</h1>
<p>You will always have access to your profile information through the Community 
Portal Welcome Center and you will be able to change any of the information, 
including your preferences and information distribution elections. Should you 
choose to discontinue your subscription to the Community Portal, your profile 
information will continue to be protected under the terms of this Privacy 
Policy.</p>
<h1>How we protect your personal information</h1>
<p>Unisys has security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, 
misuse and alteration of your user data under our control. Data you enter in the 
Community Portal Registration is encrypted with secure server software (SSL). 
Once the data reaches our site, it is protected by the same state-of-the-art 
security software we use to guard all of our company’s essential business data. 
Your profile information will be transferred to and stored on secured servers in 
the USA controlled by Unisys Corporation. Only authorized employees and 
contractors have access to the profile information you provide us and strict 
rules on Unisys employees and contractors who have access either to the 
databases that store user information or to the servers that host our services 
While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not 
occur, we make every effort to prevent such unfortunate occurrences. Any other 
particularly sensitive information, such as your credit card number collected 
for a commerce transaction, is encrypted prior to transmission.</p>
<h1>Use of IP Addresses</h1>
<p>Whenever you surf the Web, an Internet Protocol (IP) address is automatically 
assigned to your computer. Web servers (the computers that host web sites) 
automatically identify your computer by IP address.</p><p'>Unisys collects IP addresses for the purposes of system 
administration, to report aggregate or individual information to the Community 
Portal Merchants and other entities hosted on the Community Portal, and hosted 
advertisers, and to audit the use of the Unisys Community Portal Site. We don’t 
normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that 
your session will be logged, but you remain anonymous to us. We can and will use 
IP addresses to identify you when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance 
with our Terms of Use, or to protect our site visitors or others.
<p></p>

<p><b>How we use ‘cookies’</b></p>

<p>In addition to the personally identifiable information that Unisys collects, we may also collect information anonymously
using ‘cookies’. Presently ‘cookies’ play an important role in making the Internet work, but there is much confusion
among Internet users about what cookies are and how they are used. A cookie is a small text file containing a
unique identification number that is transferred from a web site to the hard
drive of your computer so that the web site may identify you and track your
activities on the web site. Although we believe that the use of cookies permits us to enhance your use of the Community
Portal, most browsers permit you to disable the cookies function if you
wish. The Community Portal may use ‘cookies’ to, among other things,</p>

<p>Store your user name and/or password so that you do
not have to provide them at the time of entry.</p>

<p>Help merchants track business in their stores and
process orders in individual shopping carts</p>

<p>Measure traffic patterns</p>

<p>Estimate audience size</p>

<p>Personalize content, banners and other promotions that you will see on the site</p>


<h1>Obtaining your consent</h1>

<p>By registering for the Community Portal, you give
Unisys your consent to process your profile information in accordance with the
terms of this policy, including transferring your profile information to our
servers in the United States where it will be stored in a database of Community
Portal members. Only the information you
have elected to provide during registration (at a minimum, your contact
information) or visits to our web site will be processed.</p>

<h1>Protection of Children</h1>

<p><b>a. Privacy</b></p>

<p>Unisys will not knowingly solicit or collect personally identifiable information from a minor child without appropriate
prior verifiable parental consent. You will be requested to, but shall not be required to, include information in your
registration profile regarding the number of children in your household, their
respective ages, and whether you consent to their use of the service. If you have agreed to allow your minor
children to be registered as users of the Community Portal Service, you agree
that you shall be solely responsible for: (a) the online conduct of such children; (b) monitoring the access to
and use of the Community Portal Service by such children; and (c) the
consequences of any use of the Community Portal Service by such children.</p>

<p>In the interest of protecting children, and in
compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998:</p>

<p>We will not collect personally identifiable online contact information from children under 13
without parental consent or notice which gives the parent the opportunity to
prevent use of the information or the child’s participation. Without parental consent, such online
contact information will at most be used to provide a direct, one-time response
to a child’s request and nothing more.</p>

<p>We will not collect personally identifiable offline contract information for children under 13
without parental consent </p>

<p>We will use legitimately gathered information from children under 13 years of age solely to provide them
with access to services and content on the Community Portal and will NOT
otherwise use or disclose such personally identifiable information without
parental consent.</p>

<p>We have created a mechanism by which parents or guardians can review their children’s personal information,
ask to have that information deleted, and refuse to allow any further
collection or use of their children’s personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>We will not require children under 13 to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to
participate in an activity as a condition of participation.</p>

<p>We will not entice children under 13 with the prospect of a special game, prize, or other activity to
divulge more information than is needed to participate in the activity.</p>

<p>We will not give children under 13 the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally
identifiable contact information.</p>

<p>b. Access</p>

<p'>Locallife.com links to sites outside of the
 Community Portal and also hosts third party sites (such as e-Stores)
 and interactive features (such as chat rooms), the content of which are
 not under direct control of Unisys.Specifically, Unisys does not control the content of the linked sites
 and, although Unisys has issued guidelines instructing hosted sites and
 chat room participants not to post offensive content, Unisys does not
 otherwise select or edit
 such content. Although children        
          
         
 <strong>

under 18</strong> will

 not be granted access to certain
 services, such as chat rooms, without parental consent, we advise parents and guardians to take
 advantage of 

additional
 measures to protect their

 children from exposure to inappropriate Internet content.

<b><a name="tips">

(2) Tips:</a>     </b>
</p>

  parents’ work address and phone number, school location, photographs, etc.,
