        If you create an account in order to access certain features and services, we may
        collect certain Personal Information such as your email address, a user name and
        password. If you email us directly via an e-mail hyperlink to provide us feedback
        or to ask us a question regarding the Website or our business, we will collect any
        information contained in such email, and we will treat any such information in accordance
        with this Privacy Policy. If you provide any such feedback to us, we may use such
        feedback for any purpose, provided we will not associate such feedback with your
        Personal Information.</p>
    <p>
        We will collect all information you submit via the Website, including any Personal
        Information. Please note that you are not obligated to provide any Personal Information
        to use the Website.</p>
    <p>
        If you decide to email search content to another person through the Website, we
        will collect that person's email address in order to send this email. We will also
        collect your name, email address, and any personal message you decide to include
        in the email. We will not send additional emails to this individual, unless you
        specifically request us to do so.</p>
    <p>
        We may request Personal Information for access to or use of certain services or
        features of the Website. As discussed in more detail below, our third party business
        partners may request Personal Information from you in order to provide you with
        information about goods or services, or to provide you with other information requested
        by you. You do not need to provide any requested Personal Information, but if you
        choose not to provide requested information, you may not be able to access or use
        those features or services.</p>
    <p>
        As you navigate our Website, certain information will also be collected passively
        by Local Guides or its service providers, including Internet Protocol addresses,
        search criteria, cookies and navigational data. This type of information is not
        Personal Information and will be used in the aggregate for the purposes of gathering
        data to improve our Website, and to improve the quality of your experience when

        Information.</p>
    <p>
        "<strong>Cookies</strong>" are small pieces of information that a web site sends
        to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a web site. Local Guides may
        use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent
        Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with
        a more personal and interactive experience on the Website. Persistent Cookies can
        be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to
        disable Cookies, some areas of the Website may not work properly.</p>
    <h2>
        Our Business Partners</h2>
    <p>
        Our third party business partners may collect information, including Personal Information,
        from various locations on the Website in order to provide you with information about
        their products and services, or to provide you with other requested information.
        Some third party business partners may request you to submit information by completing
        a form to receive more information about services or products offered by the business
        partners. The use of the information you provide to the third party business partner
        is subject to that business partner's privacy policy.</p>
    <p>
        We currently contract with third party business partners to help manage and optimize
        the Website and our Internet business. We use the services of a marketing company
        to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use the
        Website. To do this, we use web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing company
        on this Website. This information helps us learn information about the use of the
        Website, including what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our
        services and products are of most interest to our visitors, and what types of offers
        our visitors like to see. Although our marketing company logs the information coming
        from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used as
        described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve
        the Website, you can "opt-out" of this website analysis tool by clicking here: <a href="http://www.omniture.com/privacy/product#optout" target="_blank">http://www.omniture.com/privacy/product#optout</a>.</p>
    <h2>
        How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
        In general, Personal Information you submit to us is used to respond to requests
        that you make or to provide or improve our services. We will also use your Personal
        Information as directed by you.</p>
    <p>
        We may also use your email address to send you updates or news regarding our site,
        but you may choose not to receive email of this type upon sign-up. Despite your
        indicated email preferences, we may have to send you notices of any updates to our
        Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, or your account.</p>
    <p>
        Browser-type related information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and
        timestamp data help us diagnose problems with our server, administer, and otherwise
        provide the highest possible level of service to you. In addition, we use this information
        to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to
        measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers
        of such information as well as the number of users that have been exposed to, or
        clicked on, their advertising banners.</p>
    <p>
        We may use third-party business partners to serve ads when you visit our Website.
        We may transfer to third party business partners or allow the collection by third
        party business partners of certain types of non-Personal Information for the purpose
        of providing you with advertisements on this Website and other sites about goods
        and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information
        about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used
        by these companies, please click here: <a href="http://www.zedo.com/company/optout.htm" target="_blank">http://www.zedo.com/company/optout.htm</a>.</p>
    <h2>
        Disclosure of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
        Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or
        give away any of your Personal Information to third parties. We may disclose your
        Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary
        to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on
        the Website; or (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Local Guides or
        any third party. We also share Personal Information that you voluntarily submit
        to us with our applicable third party business partner for the purpose for which
        you submitted the Personal Information. For example, if you wish to receive information
        from a third party business partner, and you provide Personal Information so that
        the business partner may contact you, we will share that Personal Information with
        the business partner.</p>
    <p>
        Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures,
        or other companies under a common control (collectively, "related entities"), we
        may in the future. We may share some or all of your Personal Information with these
        related entities, in which case we will require our related entities to honor this
        Privacy Policy. If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that
        company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume
        the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this
        Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>
        We will notify you when information about you may be provided to third parties in
        ways other than explained above, and you will have the option to prevent such information
        sharing.</p>
    <h2>
        Links</h2>
    <p>
        Our Website may contain links to third party websites to which we have no affiliation.
        Local Guides does not share your personal information with those websites and is
        not responsible for their privacy practices. We suggest you read the privacy polices
        on these third party websites.</p>
    <h2>
        Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
        You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose Personal Information (e.g.,
        username, e-mail address) via emails, messages, postings, or in other areas of the
        Website, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in your
        communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may
        result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities
        are beyond the control of Local Guides. Please do not post any personal information
        on the Website or in other areas that you expect to keep private.</p>
    <h2>
        Regarding Children</h2>
    <p>
        We do not intentionally gather Personal Information about visitors who are under
        the age of 13 or any other age group. Should a child whom we know to be under 13
        send personal information to us, we will use that information only to respond directly
        to that child (or a parent or guardian) to inform him or her that we must have parental
        consent before receiving his or her personal information. Should a child whom we
        know to be under 13 post Personal Information to our Website, we will delete any
        Personal Information that has been posted and either ask the child for a parent's
        email address for purposes of providing notice and obtaining consent to future postings,
        or take reasonable steps to block that child from using the Website, whether through
        screen name blocking, a cookie, or some other means.</p>
    <h2>
        Security</h2>
    <p>
        We use industry standard measures to maintain the security of your Personal Information.
        These measures include, but are not limited to, the use of a corporate firewall,
        storage of our software and servers in a secure co-location facility, and the requirement
        of password-protection on Personal Information. Although we take industry standard
        measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot
        fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information</p>
    <p>
        You hereby acknowledge that Local Guides is not responsible for any intercepted
        information sent via the Internet, and you hereby release us from any and all claims
        arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorized
        manner.</p>
    <h2>
        Privacy Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy is maintained in conformance with applicable privacy laws and
        regulations, and is subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial
        changes in the way we collect, use, or disclose your Personal Information, we will
        post a notice on this page. If you object to any such changes, you must cease using
        our Website. Continued use of our Website following notice of any such changes shall
        indicate your acknowledgment of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms
        and conditions of such changes.</p>
