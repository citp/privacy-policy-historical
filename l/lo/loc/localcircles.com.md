### Respecting the Privacy of Your Circles.

The local circles at LocalCircles are closed social or community networks, where members are allowed to interact among themselves. For this reason, access to information that’s available in a Circle is strictly restricted to the members of that Circle. For example, we don't let public web search engines (such as Google) index member-submitted Content in any of the local circles. For these local circles, you should not share information about one member of your Circle or information about any interactions of that member to anyone outside that Circle without taking explicit permission from that member.

LocalCircles itself operates many community circles i.e. (National, City, Cause and Governance circles are considered public circles for larger public good) and hence the activity in these circles may be shared with other social media sites, print or TV media. In most, cases these community circles are used by our members to create broader awareness about particular issues or provide feedback to Government/Organizations. For these community circles, you are welcome to share information about a member of your Circle or information about any interactions outside the circle with social media, print or TV media. You are not allowed to gather information from LocalCircles manually through posts or comments or using automated web tools. Soliciting people’s contact details for business/promotional activities is not permissible. Violating these terms may result in revocation of your account privileges including a permanent ban from our website.

### Abiding by the Law.

If compliance to law requires us to share some or all of your data at LocalCircles with Government authorities, we may disclose your data.

### Our Limitations.

LocalCircles always strives to respect the privacy of its users. However, in a complex technology environment like ours, a defect or error in our software/hardware might disclose your data in ways inconsistent with our privacy policy. In these situations, we will try to rectify the situation to the best of our ability.

### User Access and Security.

LocalCircles uses https technology and a username and password to prevent unauthorized access to your content. However, Internet by design is susceptible to a variety of security threats.

### Change of Control.

If the ownership of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so they can continue to operate the service. But they will still have to honor the commitments we have made.

### Notice of Changes:

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make changes to this policy we will notify you by publication on this page.
