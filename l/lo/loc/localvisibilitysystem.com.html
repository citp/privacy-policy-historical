<h2>"Will You Spam Me?"</h2>

<p>No. We do not tolerate spam and will never sell, rent, lease or give away your information (name, address, email, etc.) to any third party. Nor will we send you unsolicited email. We want to keep you as a customer or visitor; it is in our interest to make sure you do not get spammed. </p>

<h2>"Is My Information Safe?"</h2>
<p>Yes. We are the only ones who will ever see it. In addition, we only ask for the information necessary to deliver you either any free information you requested or products you wish to buy from us. We will not disclose your personally identifiable information to any person or company except where you have given us permission to do so or if the law requires it.</p>
<p>Financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date) is used only to charge the customer for the service he/she is purchasing. This will never be given to any third party (other than the credit card authorization processor).</p>
<p>Please note that we use conversion and signup tracking. It does not give us any additional information about you, but simply gives us a better sense of how business owners like you find us.</p>

<h2>"How Do I Opt Out?"</h2>
<p>If you would no longer like to receive information from us and would like to leave our mailing list, just let us know, or click the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of an email you have received from us in the past.</p>

<h2>"How Can I Contact You?"</h2>
<p>If you have any questions about this privacy statement or this website in general, please send an email to Phil@LocalVisibilitySystem.com</p>
