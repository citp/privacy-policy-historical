   We value your Membership and your privacy is very important to us. Lockheed Federal Credit Union respects your
concerns about maintaining privacy of your personal information. We want to assure you that we maintain strict security
procedures to protect your information.
   We are committed to providing you with competitive products and services to meet your financial needs, which
necessitates that we share information about you to complete your transactions and to provide you with certain financial
opportunities. In order to do so, we share information with our affiliate, LFCU Financial Services, Inc. and have entered into
agreements with nonaffiliated third party financial service providers and other companies that provide either services to us or
additional financial products for you to consider. We may also disclose information about you under other circumstances as
permitted or required by law. These disclosures typically include information to follow your instructions as you authorize,
process transactions on your behalf, conduct our operations, or protect the security of our financial records.

   To help us serve your financial needs, provide member service, offer new products and services and fulfill legal and
regulatory requirements, we collect nonpublic personal information about you as follows:
   • Information you provide to us verbally or in writing on our Membership Application, loan applications, and other
     applications and forms, such as your name, address, Social Security Number, date of birth, assets, income and debt.

     share account histories and balances, payment history, brokerage account activity (if you have established a brokerage

Information We Disclose
Disclosure to Our Affiliate
   We may disclose nonpublic personal information regarding your name, address, telephone number, and credit union
accounts, transactions, and experiences with our affiliate, LFCU Financial Services, Inc. so that our affiliate may offer you
insurance and uninsured investment products that may be of interest to you. We are permitted under the Fair Credit
Reporting Act to share information with our affiliate about our transactions or experiences with you; however, we will not
share credit-related information such as credit history and other information shown on consumer credit reports and income
and asset information from applications.
Disclosure to Nonaffiliated Third Parties
   In addition to the nonpublic personal information we may disclose in order to provide you with, process and service the
products and services that you request, or to effect, administer, or enforce a transaction that you request or authorize, we
may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to the following types of nonaffiliated third parties:
   • Financial service providers, such as ATM networks, CU Service Centers, mortgage insurers, escrow and title
     companies, bill payment processors, credit reporting agencies and similar consumer reporting agencies like
     ChexSystems.
   • Non-financial companies, such as check printers, data processing companies, and companies that prepare and
     distribute our account statements and marketing information.
   • Others, such as technical service consultants and Internet services companies.


    We may also disclose nonpublic personal information about you to nonaffiliated third parties as permitted or required by
law.
Disclosure Under Marketing Arrangements
    We may also disclose information we collect (excluding your account numbers, PINs, Passwords, or other access codes,
and Social Security Number) as described in “Information We Collect About You” above, to nonaffiliated third party
companies that perform marketing and related services on our behalf, and to other financial service providers with whom we
have joint marketing agreements, for the purpose of marketing and targeted direct mail solicitations of financial products and
services that we believe may be of value and interest to you. In all instances, we only disclose the limited information
necessary to perform these services and do not share information we have collected about you, except as permitted by law.
    To protect your privacy, we work only with companies that agree to maintain strong confidentiality protections and limit the
use of information that we provide. All agreements with other companies, including joint marketing agreements, contain
required confidentiality clauses that prohibit these companies from selling the information we provide to them to other third
parties.
If You Terminate Your Relationship With Us
    If your credit union Membership is terminated we will not share information we have collected about you, except as
permitted or required by law.
Confidentiality and Security
    We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who have a specific business in
utilizing your data. Our employees are trained in the importance of maintaining confidentiality and customer privacy. We
maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations and leading industry practices
to safeguard your nonpublic personal information.
