<p>This Service and  Network are owned and operated by LockerDome, LLC (collectively,  "us", "we" or "the Company"). Our Privacy Policy  is designed to help you understand how we collect and use the personal  information you decide to share, and help you make informed decisions when  using the LockerDome Service located at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lockerdome.com">www.lockerdome.com</a> ("LockerDome" or  "Website"), or any subdomain (i.e. <a target="_blank" href="http://subdomain.lockerdome.com">subdomain.lockerdome.com</a>) of  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lockerdome.com">www.lockerdome.com</a>.</p>

<p>By  using or accessing LockerDome, or any subdomain (i.e. <a target="_blank" href="http://subdomain.lockerdome.com">subdomain.lockerdome.com</a>)  of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lockerdome.com">www.lockerdome.com</a>, you are accepting the practices described in this  Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>

<p>When you visit LockerDome, or any subdomain (i.e. <a target="_blank" href="http://subdomain.lockerdome.com">subdomain.lockerdome.com</a>) of  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lockerdome.com">www.lockerdome.com</a>, you provide us with two types of information: personal  information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us and Website  use information collected by us as you interact with our Website.</p>

<p>When  you register with LockerDome, or any subdomain (i.e. <a target="_blank" href="http://subdomain.lockerdome.com">subdomain.lockerdome.com</a>)  of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lockerdome.com">www.lockerdome.com</a>, you provide us with certain personal information, such  as your name, your email address, your country, your gender, and any other  personal or preference information that you provide to us.</p>

<p>When  you enter LockerDome, or any subdomain (i.e. <a target="_blank" href="http://subdomain.lockerdome.com">subdomain.lockerdome.com</a>) of  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lockerdome.com">www.lockerdome.com</a>, we collect your browser type and IP address. This  information is gathered for all LockerDome visitors. In addition, we store  certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a  piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user.  We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies  terminate once the user closes the browser. By default, we use a persistent  cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for  you to login when you come back to LockerDome, or any subdomain (i.e.  <a target="_blank" href="http://subdomain.lockerdome.com">subdomain.lockerdome.com</a>) of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lockerdome.com">www.lockerdome.com</a>. You can remove or block this  cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this  convenience feature.</p>

<p>When  you use LockerDome, or any subdomain (i.e. <a target="_blank" href="http://subdomain.lockerdome.com">subdomain.lockerdome.com</a>) of  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lockerdome.com">www.lockerdome.com</a>, you may form relationships, send messages, perform searches  and queries, set up events, and transmit information through various channels.  We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer  personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you  can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your friend list.  When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version  for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of  that information.</p>

<p>By  using LockerDome, or any subdomain (i.e. <a target="_blank" href="http://subdomain.lockerdome.com">subdomain.lockerdome.com</a>) of  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lockerdome.com">www.lockerdome.com</a>, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred  to and processed in the United States and elsewhere where the service is  available.</p>

<p><strong>POLICY ON COLLECTING INFORMATION FROM  CHILDREN</strong></p>

<p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under  the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register WITHOUT full parental  consent and administration of information within a Parent Account. No one under  age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information outside of a Parent  Account. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information  from anyone under the age of 13 outside of a Parent Account, we will delete  that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any  information from or anyone under the age of 13 outside of a Parent Account,  please contact us at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:support@lockerdome.com">support@lockerdome.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>USE OF INFORMATION OBTAINED BY LOCKERDOME</strong></p>

<p>When you register with LockerDome, or any subdomain (i.e.  <a target="_blank" href="http://subdomain.lockerdome.com">subdomain.lockerdome.com</a>) of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lockerdome.com">www.lockerdome.com</a>, you create your own profile  and privacy settings that is viewable by this Network, as well  as by the entire LockerDome community. We may occasionally use your name and  email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by  LockerDome that we think you may find valuable.</p>

<p>Profile  information is used by us primarily to be presented back to and edited by you  when you access the Service and to be presented to others permitted to view  that information by your privacy settings. In some cases where your privacy  settings permit it (e.g., posting to your Comments), other LockerDome users may  be able to supplement your profile. You can delete these comments if you wish.</p>

<p>We may  use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to  third parties. We do this for purposes of providing relevant and targeted  advertisements to our Members.</p>

<p><strong>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</strong></p>

<p>We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances  where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to offer the service,  2) legally required or, 3) permitted by you. For example:</p>

<ul type="disc">

  <li>We may provide information to       service providers to help us bring you the services we offer.       Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as       to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out       email updates about LockerDome, to remove repetitive information from our       user lists, to process payments for products or services, or to provide       search results or links (including sponsored links). In connection with       these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have       access to your personal information for use for a limited time in       connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third parties       for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable       contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information       to the LockerDome -specified purposes.</li>

  <li>We may be required to disclose       user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court       orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal       information until we have a good faith belief that an information request       by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards.       Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it       is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to       prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Service or       using the LockerDome name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may       include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or       government agencies.</li>

  <li>We let you choose to share       information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through       sponsored accounts or other on-site offers.</li>

  <li>We may provide services jointly       with other companies on <a target="_blank" href="http://lockerdome.com">lockerdome.com</a>. In doing so we may choose to share       Member information with these companies to better provide services that       are relevant to our Members.</li>

  <li>If the ownership of the Website,       Service, or individual business units owned by LockerDome, LLC were to       change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the       service can continue operations. In any such transfer of information, your       user information would remain subject to the promises made in any       pre-existing Privacy Policy.</li>

</ul>

We are not responsible  for the privacy practices of other Websites. We encourage our users to be aware  when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every Website  that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies  solely to information collected on the LockerDome Platform and any subdomain  (i.e. <a target="_blank" href="http://subdomain.lockerdome.com">subdomain.lockerdome.com</a>) of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lockerdome.com">www.lockerdome.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING</strong></p>

<p>Advertisements that appear on LockerDome, or any subdomain (i.e.  <a target="_blank" href="http://subdomain.lockerdome.com">subdomain.lockerdome.com</a>) of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lockerdome.com">www.lockerdome.com</a>, are sometimes delivered (or  "served") directly to users by third party advertisers. They  automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party  advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other  technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as  "1x1 gifs") to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to  personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to  recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to  measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content.  In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your  computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements  are clicked. We do not have access to or control of the cookies that may be  placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access  to your contact information stored on LockerDome, or any subdomain (i.e.  <a target="_blank" href="http://subdomain.lockerdome.com">subdomain.lockerdome.com</a>) of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lockerdome.com">www.lockerdome.com</a>, unless you choose to share it  with them.</p>

<p>This  privacy policy covers the use of cookies by us and does not cover the use of  cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.</p>

LockerDome users may modify or  remove their profile information at any time by logging into their account.  Information will be updated immediately. Individuals who wish to deactivate  their LockerDome account may do by sending an email to <a target="_blank" href="mailto:support@lockerdome.com">support@lockerdome.com</a>  and writing their request for deactivation in the email. Removed information  may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be  generally available to members of LockerDome, or the members at any subdomain  (i.e. <a target="_blank" href="http://subdomain.lockerdome.com">subdomain.lockerdome.com</a>) of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lockerdome.com">www.lockerdome.com</a>.</p>

Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of member  account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure,  and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any  time.
