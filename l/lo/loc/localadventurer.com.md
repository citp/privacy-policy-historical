# Disclosure » Local Adventurer » Travel Adventures in NYC + World Wide

### AFFILIATES

We want to keep this blog authentic and a reliable resource. It is our promise to be 100% transparent and disclose how we make our living off of Local Adventurer.

This is a for-profit blog and contains occasional affiliate links where we receive a small commission on sales of the products that are linked at no additional cost to you. These links are always disclosed, and this helps us to continue improving our content and keep this site running.

Our affiliate relationships do not affect our opinions and we only feature products that we already own or genuinely would recommend! Authenticity is very important to us, which is why we’ve turned down many brand deals and have sent back products that were not a good fit for us and our readers.  [Here is a comprehensive list of the brands](https://localadventurer.com/brand-partnerships/) that we are proud and fortunate to have as partners and sponsors.

Thank you for supporting Local Adventurer and the brands that make this possible
