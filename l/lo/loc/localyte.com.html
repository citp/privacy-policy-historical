<p>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Localyte products or services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of the Localyte service. Localyte uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to: Access your information when you "sign in"; keep track of preferences you specify while you are using Localyte's services; display the most appropriate advertising banners, based on your interests and activity on Localyte; estimate and report Localyte's total audience size and traffic; conduct research to improve Localyte's content and services.</p>
<h4>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h4>
<p>When you post a message, your Localyte ID or alias is visible to other users. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Localyte may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate the Localyte Terms of Use. Localyte may disclose personally identifiable information to parties in compliance with Localyte's Copyright Policy, as Localyte in Localyte's sole discretion believes necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity. In such events, Localyte may disclose name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email address and company name.  Localyte may share aggregated demographic information with business partners.</p>
<p>Localyte will not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with nonaffiliated parties except as specified in this Privacy Policy to provide products or services you have requested or when Localyte has your permission. It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Localyte's Terms of Use, as specified in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise required by law. Localyte will transfer information about you if Localyte is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Localyte will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Localyte web site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<p>As part of transacting on Localyte, you may obtain another Localyte user's email address, address and/or other information. Pursuant to Localyte's Terms of Use, you have a limited license to use this information.  This information should only be used for Localyte-related communications or for Localyte-facilitated transactions.  Localyte has not granted you a license to use the information for unsolicited commercial messages.  Without limiting the foregoing, without express consent from the user, you are not licensed to add any Localyte user to your email or physical mail list.</p>
<p>Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and Localyte's ability to keep the community free from bad actors, Localyte will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order, legal process, or substantially similar legal procedure, except when Localyte believes in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to protect Localyte's rights, prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss, or to report suspected illegal activity.</p>
<h4>Forums / Chat Rooms</h4>
<p>If you use a form or chat room on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by others could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Localyte is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>
<h4>Third Parties</h4>
<p>Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information Localyte collects from you. If you disclose your information to others, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Localyte does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. Localyte encourages you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.</p>
<h4>Editing and Deleting Account Information</h4>
<p>You can change your Localyte Account Information at any time. Localyte may send you certain communications relating to the Localyte service, such as service-related announcements and administrative messages that are considered part of your Localyte account. You can delete your Localyte account by emailing support@localyte.com.  Please note that your identification, billing and contact information may remain in Localyte's records for some period. </p>
<p>Localyte limits access to personal information about you to employees who Localyte believes reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. Your Localyte Account Information is password-protected. </p>
<p>If your personally identifiable information changes you may correct or update it by making the change on Your Localyte Page.  You may delete or deactivate your account by emailing Customer Support at support@localyte.com  or by postal mail at the contact information listed below.
