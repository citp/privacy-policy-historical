      <h1>LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
      <p>Last Updated: February 1,   2009</p>
      <p>PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY   POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME AND CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE UPON POSTING.   PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES AS IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY   TO BE AWARE OF CHANGES. LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM DOES NOT PROVIDE NOTICES OF CHANGES   IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN BY POSTING THE CHANGES AT THIS WEB SITE.</p>
      <p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE   WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION   TO LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED   ON ANY OF THE WEB SITES REFERRED TO IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>
      <p>The information collection,   use, and dissemination practices of LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM</p>
      <p>This policy applies   to LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM's collection, use, storage and disclosure of information   by LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries   and related companies (collectively, the "Websites"), (b)   on various third party websites, and (c) to LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM's other information   collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties.   LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM is not responsible for the information collection or privacy   practices of third web sites or applications.</p>
      <p><strong>1. Collection of   Information.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>1.1 Survey Information.</strong></p>
      <p>LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM collects   information from individuals by various methods, including, but not   limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM survey,   order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means   of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated   by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein,   "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites,   and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other   than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones   and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM   or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to   provide various information to LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM, which may include his or   her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers   (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary   range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number,   employment information, personal and online interests, and such other   information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey   Information"). LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM may also collect information concerning   an individual from another source and uses that information in combination   with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys   is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to   provide Survey Information to LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM or Third Party, but an individual   may receive incentives from LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM or a Third Party in exchange   for providing Survey Information to LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM.</p>
      <p><strong>1.2 Third Party   List Information.</strong></p>
      <p>LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM collects   information from individuals when an individual provides information   to a third party and LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM subsequently purchases, licenses, or   otherwise acquires the information from the third party (the "Seller").   Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's   name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including   cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range,   education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal   and online interests, and such other information as the individual may   have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information").   When acquiring Third Party List Information, LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM seeks assurances   from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party   List Information to LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM and that the Seller has a right to provide   offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information   is included on the Seller's list.</p>
      <p><strong>1.3 Other Information.</strong></p>
      <p>Other occasions when   LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM obtains information from individuals include (1) when an   individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive   offered by LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests   assistance through LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM's customer service department, and (3)   when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM service or   newsletter (together, "Other Information").</p>
      <p><strong>1.4 Cookies, Web   Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</strong></p>
      <p>LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM currently   uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related   information about an individual with information about the individual   in our database. Additionally, LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM may use other new and evolving   sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").</p>
      <p><strong>(a) Cookies.</strong></p>
      <p>A cookie is a small   amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer   that allows LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM to identify the individual with his or her corresponding   data that resides in LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM's database. You may read more about   cookies at <a href="http://cookiecentral.com" target="_blank">http://cookiecentral.com</a>. Individuals who use the Websites   need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality   of the Websites.</p>
      <p><strong>(b) Web Beacons.</strong></p>
      <p>A web beacon is programming   code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an   &lt;img src="x"&gt; programming function -- see <a href="http://truste.org" target="_blank">http://truste.org</a> for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's   unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database   and associate the individual with previously acquired information about   an individual in a database. This allows LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM to track certain   web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine   products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track   online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM   might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon   on the third party's website where fishing products are sold. When Joe,   an individual listed in LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM's database, visits the fishing website,   LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited   the fishing site, and LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM would then update Joe's profile with   the information that Joe is interested in fishing. LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM may thereafter   present offers of fishing related products and services to Joe. In addition   to using web beacons on web pages, LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM also uses web beacons   in email messages sent to individuals listed in LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM's database.</p>
      <p><strong>(c) New Technology.</strong></p>
      <p>The use of technology   on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving,   as is LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM's use of new and evolving technology. As a result,   LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for   any updates regarding its use of technology.</p>
      <p><strong>1.5 Outside Information.</strong></p>
      <p>LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM may receive   information about individuals from third parties or from other sources   of information outside of LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM including information located in   public databases ("Outside Information").</p>
      <p><strong>1.6 Individual Information.</strong></p>
      <p>As used herein, Individual   Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information,   Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information,   and any other information LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM gathers or receives about individuals.</p>
      <p><strong>1.7 No Information   Collected from Children.</strong></p>
      <p>LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM will never   knowingly collect any personal information about children under the   age of 13. If LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM obtains actual knowledge that it has collected   personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information   will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect   such information, LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM has no such information to use or to disclose   to third parties. LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM has designed this policy in order to comply   with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").</p>
      <p><strong>1.8 Credit Card   Information.</strong></p>
      <p>LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM may in certain   cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the   expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when   an individual places an order from LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM. When the Credit Card   Information is submitted to LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM, such information is encrypted   and is protected with SSL encryption software. LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM will use the   Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the   purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed   to third parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.</p>
      <p><strong>2.   Use of Individual Information.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2.1 Discretion to   Use Information.</strong></p>
      <p>THE COMPANY MAY USE   INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN COMPANY'S   SOLE DISCRETION.</p>
      <p>The following paragraphs   in Section 2 describe how LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM currently uses Individual Information,   but LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM may change or broaden its use at any time. As noted below,   LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM may update this policy from time to time. LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM may   use Individual Information to provide promotional offers to individuals   by means of email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing,   online banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible   uses.</p>
      <p><strong>2.2 Email.</strong></p>
      <p>LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM uses Individual   Information to provide promotional offers by email to individuals. LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM   may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. If email recipients   wish to end their email subscription from a particular list, they need   to follow the instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe   from the particular list. </p>
      <p><strong>2.2(a) Content of   Email Messages.</strong></p>
      <p>In certain commercial   email messages sent by LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM, an advertiser's name will appear   in the "From:" line but hitting the "Reply" button   will cause a reply email to be sent to LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM. The "Subject:"   line of LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM email messages will usually contain a line provided   from the advertiser to LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM.</p>
      <p><strong>2.2(b) Solicited   Email.</strong></p>
      <p>LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM only sends   email to individuals who have agreed to our Terms &amp; Conditions and Privacy Policy, and have supplied their contact information including email address on the Registration page; or  to individuals who have agreed on third party websites   to receive email from third parties such as LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM. LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM does   not send unsolicited email messages. As a result, statutes requiring   certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM's   email messages.</p>
      <p><strong>2.3 Targeted Advertising.</strong></p>
      <p>LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM uses Individual   Information to target advertising to an individual. When an individual   is using the Internet, LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM uses Technology Information (see also   Section 2.5 below) to associate an individual with that person's Individual   Information, and LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM attempts to show advertising for products   and services in which the person has expressed an interest in the Surveys,   indicated an interest by means of Technology Information, and otherwise.   LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM may, at its discretion, target advertising by using email,   direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and other means of communication   to provide promotional offers.</p>
      <p><strong>2.4 Direct Mail   and Telemarketing.</strong></p>
      <p>LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM uses Individual   Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to individuals using   direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and cell phones.</p>
      <p><strong>2.5 Use of Technology   Information.</strong></p>
      <p>LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM uses Technology   Information (1) to match a person's Survey Information and Third Party   List Information to other categories of Individual Information to make   and improve profiles of individuals, (2) to track a person's online   browsing habits on the Internet, (3) to determine which areas of LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM's   web sites are most frequently visited. This information helps LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM   to better understand the online habits of individuals so that LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM   can target advertising and promotions to them.</p>
      <p><strong>2.6 Profiles of   Individuals.</strong></p>
      <p>LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM uses Individual   Information to make a profile of an individual. A profile can be created   by combining Survey Information and Third Party List Information with   other sources of Individual Information such as information obtained   from public databases.</p>
      <p><strong>2.7 Storage of Individual   Information</strong>.</p>
      <p>LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM stores the   Individual Information in a database. Computers   housing these databases have security measures (such as a firewall) in place to protect against   the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM's   control. Not withstanding such measures, LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM cannot guarantee   that its security measures will prevent LOCALJOBWIZARD.COM computers from being   illegally accessed, and the Individual Information on them stolen or   altered.</p>

      <p><strong>3.1 Sale or Transfer   to Third Parties.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>4. Privacy Practices   of Third Parties.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4.1 Advertiser cookies   and web beacons.</strong></p>
