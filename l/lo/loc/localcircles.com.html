			<div>Credible local information in a community gets built when people provide accurate information in an accountable way. 
			Be it inviting new members to a community or sharing experiences about local businesses, you can improve the credibility of information available to the communities. 
			To encourage this value addition by all local community members, LocalCircles tracks your contributions.</div>

<h4>How do we track your contribution:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b></b> Rating a local business - 10 points</li>
  <li><b></b> Adding a local business - 20 points</li>

  <li><b></b> Creating an active Circle (20+ members) - 20 points</li>

  <li><b></b> Inviting a new member into your Circle (once they join) - 5 points</li>
