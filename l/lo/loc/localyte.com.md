Localyte may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate the Localyte Terms of Use. Localyte may disclose personally identifiable information to parties in compliance with Localyte's Copyright Policy, as Localyte in Localyte's sole discretion believes necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity.

Localyte will not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with nonaffiliated parties except as specified in this Privacy Policy to provide products or services you have requested or when Localyte has your permission. It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Localyte's Terms of Use, as specified in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise required by law. Localyte will transfer information about you if Localyte is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Localyte will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Localyte web site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

As part of transacting on Localyte, you may obtain another Localyte user's email address, address and/or other information. Pursuant to Localyte's Terms of Use, you have a limited license to use this information. This information should only be used for Localyte-related communications or for Localyte-facilitated transactions. Localyte has not granted you a license to use the information for unsolicited commercial messages. Without limiting the foregoing, without express consent from the user, you are not licensed to add any Localyte user to your email or physical mail list.

Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and Localyte's ability to keep the community free from bad actors, Localyte will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order, legal process, or substantially similar legal procedure, except when Localyte believes in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to protect Localyte's rights, prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss, or to report suspected illegal activity.

#### Forums / Chat Rooms

If you use a form or chat room on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by others could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Localyte is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.

#### Third Parties
