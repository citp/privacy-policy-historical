# Privacy Policy

Introduction

Char Software, Inc. d/b/a Localytics (“us," "we," or "Localytics") is committed to respecting the privacy rights of our customers (“Customers”) and their end users (“End Users”), as well as other users of the Localytics mobile analytics services (“Services”) and the Localytics websites, including http://www.localytics.com, http://wiki.localytics.com and http://analytics.localytics.com and any successor sites (collectively, “Websites"). We created this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to give you confidence as you use the Services and Websites, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Services and Websites, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Services Websites or any websites of the partners or Customers of Localytics, each of which may have data collection, storage, and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy. Your use of the Websites and certain aspects of the Services are governed by this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. 

Traffic Data Collected

When you visit the Websites, web servers collect information about your visit (known as “traffic data”), which is stored as anonymous, aggregate data. We use traffic data to learn more about visitors' use of the Websites and to improve the quality of the content and functionality of the Websites, as well as to target our offerings to the people most interested in them based on their use of the Websites.

In order to provide the Services to our Customers, Localytics collects certain information and data about End Users that is sent to our servers from one of the Localytics “Client Libraries” that may be integrated into our Customers' mobile application(s) (“End User Information”). Localytics provides analyses of anonymized, aggregate End User Information to its Customers and to other third parties (“Analyzed Data”). Localytics takes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Analyzed Data does not include any PII, as defined below.

Personally Identifiable Information

Personally identifiable information (“PII”) is information that can be used to identify an individual user, for example, a person's name, home address, email address or phone number. We receive and store any PII users enter on our Websites, send to us in an email or voluntarily provide to us in any other way.

PII Collected for Website Registration

In order for you to access certain areas of the Websites or use certain features of the Services, we may require you to provide us with certain PII, such as your name and e-mail address ("Personal Information"). You may also provide Localytics with certain optional information, including, without limitation, your phone number and company name, at your sole discretion (“Optional Information”). For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, all Optional Information that you provide us will be deemed Personal Information.

PII Collected via the Services

Use of the Services does not require that Localytics' customers provide to Localytics, and Localytics requests that its Customers do not provide to it, any PII relating to their End Users. End Users should be aware, however, that Localytics' Customers may request such information from End Users in order to use their mobile applications and such PII may be included in the End User Information provided to Localytics. End Users should therefore review the privacy policies of the mobile applications they use to assess the security of any PII they disclose. To the extent Localytics does receive any PII as part of the End User Information, Localytics shall make reasonable efforts, consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy, to maintain the confidentiality of such PII.

Cookies

"Cookies" are pieces of information that the Websites or Services may transfer to your computer or mobile device for record-keeping purposes. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. You may be able to set your web browser to refuse cookies. You may choose to disable cookies, however, by doing so, you may not have access to the entire set of features of the Websites or Services.

User Communications

When you send e-mail or other communications to Localytics, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.

Storage

We store all Traffic Data, End User Information and all Analyzed Data, and review postings indefinitely, even after "deletion," and may archive such information elsewhere.

Information Sharing

Localytics does not rent, sell or share PII, including your Personal Information, with any third parties except in the following limited circumstances:

  * We have your express consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any Personal Information.
  * To our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted business partners (“Partners”) for the purpose of processing Personal Information or Analyzed Data on our behalf, but only to provide the requested Services and subject to this Privacy Policy. Such Partners shall be bound to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your Personal Information to carry out their specific business obligations to Localytics and to provide your requested Services.
  * In the event of a merger, sale or acquisition by or of Localytics. In this event, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.



Confidentiality and Security

Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personal Information private and will not share it with third parties, unless we believe in good faith that disclosure of your Personal Information or any other information we collect about you is necessary to: (1) comply with a court order or other legal process; (2) protect the rights, property or safety of Localytics or another party; (3) enforce our Terms of Use; or (4) respond to claims that any posting or other content violates the rights of third parties.

Information Security and Data Integrity

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.

Although we make good faith efforts to store Personal Information in a secure operating environment that is not open to the public, you should understand that there is no such thing as complete security, and we do not guarantee that there will be no unintended disclosures of your Personal Information. If we become aware that your Personal Information has been disclosed in a manner not in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the nature and extent of the disclosure (to the extent we know that information) as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted by law.

Lost or Stolen Information

You must promptly notify us if your Personal Information is lost, stolen, or used without permission. In such an event, we will remove that Personal Information from your account and update our records accordingly.

Updates and Changes to Privacy Policy

Please note that we reserve the right, at any time, to add to, change, update, or modify this Privacy Policy. We will notify you of any changes by updating this page. If, in Localytics reasonable discretion, the changes are material we will post a notice on our website or send you an email. Information collected will be subject to the Privacy Policy in place at the time of collection.

Controlling Your Personal Information

As a registered user of the Websites, you can modify some of the Personal Information you have included in your profile by logging in and accessing your account. You cannot, however, change your username once you have registered. Upon your request, Localytics will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete your account and the Personal Information in your profile; however, it may be impossible to remove your account without some residual information being retained by Localytics. Registered users who wish to close their account should contact contact@localytics.com.
