		<li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our <a href="/help/terms.cfm" title="terms of use" target="_blank">terms of use</a>; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Global Personals, our customers, or others.
