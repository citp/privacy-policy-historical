Information on our services’ may contain links to third party websites, and any information you provide to those sites will be covered by any privacy policies they may have. Please be sure to read the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit. It is those sites' responsibility to protect any information you give them, so we can't be held liable for their wrongful use of your personally identifying information.

### 2\. Your Personal Data and How We Use It

2.1. In this Section 2 we set out: 

  * the general categories of data and types of personal data that we may process; 
  * the source of that personal data; 
  * the purposes for which we may process personal data; and 
  * the legal bases of the processing. 



2.2. We may process your registration data (" **registration data** "). Registration data may include your username and email address. The source of the registration data is you. Registration data is required in order for you to be able to use the service.

2.3. We may process your account data ( **account data** "). Account data may include your full name, email address, username, country and telephone number. The source of the account data is you. The account data may be processed for the purposes of providing our services, ensuring the security of our users and services, and communicating with you. Users may need to set their full name to their user profile before buying bitcoins online from some traders. Full name is only shown to bitcoin sellers with whom user has opened trades. Verifying the full name helps protecting users against fraudulent payments, increase user’s trustworthiness, and provides an alternative way to access user’s LocalBitcoins wallet in case the password is lost or the account is hacked. Phone number is used for notification purposes and is an alternative mechanism to identify users in case the password is lost or account gets hacked. The legal bases for this processing are consent; the performance of a contract between you and us and/or taking steps, at your request, to enter into such a contract; and our legitimate interests, namely the operation of our business model. 

2.4. We may process your identity documents (" **ID data** "). Verifying account with an ID is currently mandatory to all advertisers and users whose trading volume exceeds certain limit. ID may contain your full name, country, date of birth, social security number and gender. The purpose for ID data is to protect our users from fraud and helps us to prevent, detect and investigate fraud, money laundering, criminal activity or other misuse of our service. Moreover, by requiring all advertisers to ID verify will help us to provide a more trustworthy, safe and reliable trading experience for our customers. ID creates a strong assumption about the ownership of the account and thus ensures that we can return access to your account in case your account is hacked. Legal bases for this processing are consent and legitimate interests of ours and/or by third-parties, namely to prevent, detect and investigate fraud, criminal activity or other misuse of the services and to prevent security issues. 

2.5. We may process data about your use of our website and services (" **usage data** "). Usage data is primarily non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers, servers, and services like Google Analytics typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the time of each visit.

We gather event based tracking data with the help of Mixpanel, and this data may also contain your email address, IP address and country code. 2) Data that we collect mainly for technical, security and/or fraud prevention reasons or for tracking errors (" **technical data"** ). We gather data on website errors with the help of Sentry which may occasionally contain usage data. We also log certain events from your actions on our site.

Information stored on received transactions may include timestamp, bitcoin amount, deposit address (unique) and transaction ID and other publicly available data from the bitcoin blockchain. Withdrawal transactions may include data such as timestamp, bitcoin amount, sent address, transaction ID, and description. The source of the trade data is you and/or your trading partner. The legal bases for this processing are consent; the performance of a contract between you and us and/or taking steps, at your request, to enter into such a contract and our legitimate interests, namely the operation of our business model. 

2.8. We may process information contained in or relating to any communication that you send to us or what you generate through the use of our service (" **communication data** "). Communication data includes 1) all your messages, requests and other communication with our customer support which may happen during the dispute review process or via support tickets, emails, or by means of any other communication tool; and 2) all your communication and file attachments that you generate when conducting trades with other users (" **trade chat messages"** ) or other data that you generated mainly by communicating to other users.

2.13. All the aforementioned general categories of data may contain data that by itself does not identify you and is therefore not deemed as personal data. 

2.14. Please try to avoid supplying any unnecessary personal data to us. 

### 3\. Information You Choose to Display Publicly on Our Services

3.1. Some users may elect to publicly post personally identifying or sensitive information about themselves in their normal use of our services. This could occur through use of optional profile fields, in interactions on public boards, and using our forum at localbitcoins.com, or if a previously private interaction is made public. Information like that, which is voluntarily posted in publicly visible parts of our services, is considered to be public, even if it would otherwise be considered to be personally identifying or sensitive. As such, it is not subject to the protocols listed below, because we don't control it; you do. Additionally, voluntarily publicizing such information means that you lose any privacy rights you might normally have with regards to that information. It may also increase your chances of receiving unwanted communications, like spam. 

3.2. Please also remember that if you choose to provide personally identifiable information using certain public features of our services, individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in content that you create or information that you submit through our Services. 

### 4\. Providing Your Personal Data to Others

4.1. In this Section 4 we set out: 

  * External services (" **processors** ") that we use for processing personal data on behalf of us; 
  * Types of personal data that processors may process; 
  * The reason for using them. 



4.2. For processing ID data, we use netverify service by Jumio Corporation (" **Jumio** "), a company located in the United States. ID may contain your full name, country, date of birth, social security number and gender. 

4.3. For behaviour statistics, business intelligence and email campaigns we use the service by Mixpanel Inc (" **Mixpanel** "), a company located in the United States and for behaviour statistics and business intelligence also the service by Google LLC (" **Google Analytics** "), a company located in the United States. Data that we may provide to Mixpanel may include your email address, IP address and country code and that data is used by Mixpanel to generate information about your usage of our service. Data that we may provide to Google Analytics may include your IP address and that data is used by Google Analytics to generate information about your usage of our service. The reason for using them both is that their tracking methods differ considerably and we use them for those different purposes: Mixpanel is focused on event and behaviour tracking as well as for sending informational messages while Google Analytics is more focused on page views. 

4.4. For tracking server errors, we use the service by Functional Software Inc (" **Sentry** "), a company located in the United States. Error messages are rare but they may include your IP address. Sentry is used for monitoring and fixing errors and crashes. 

4.5. For processing notification data, we use the service by SendGrid Inc (" **SendGrid** "), a company located in the United States for delivering emails to users, and we may use the services by Nexmo Inc (located in the United States), Twilio Inc. (located in the United States) and TM4B Ltd. (located in the United Kingdom) for delivering SMS messages to users. 

4.6. LocalBitcoins.com forum is a third-party application embedded to our site. It is a service operated by Muut Inc (" **Muut** "), a company located in the United States. Personal data that users may on rare occasions generate by using forum is thus processed by Muut. 

4.7. In addition to the specific disclosures of personal data set out in this Section 4, we may also disclose your personal data 1) to our auditors, lawyers, accountants, consultants and other professional advisors insofar as it is reasonably necessary for the purposes of obtaining professional advice or managing legal disputes and risks; 2) where such disclosure is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests and/or the vital interests of a third-party. 

### 5\. International Transfers of Your Personal Data

5.1. We store your information primarily within the European Economic Area. However, some features and requirements of the service, involve transferring your information to third-party service providers outside the European Economic Area. We have described all those service providers above in the Section 4. Where such service providers are not established in a country ensuring an adequate level of protection within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, such as the United States, the transfers will be covered by the standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission or by another appropriate safeguard mechanism such as the Privacy Shield Framework.

6.5. In some cases it is not possible for us to specify in advance the periods for which your personal data will be retained. In such cases, we will determine the period of retention based on the period we need to access the data for the provision of services, receiving payment, resolving your customer support issue or other issues or for any other auditing or legal reasons. 

6.6. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 6, we may retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.
