7.1. In this Section 7, we have summarised the principal rights that you have under data protection law.

Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for further details of these rights. 

7.2. Your principal rights under the data protection law are: 

(a) the right to access; 

You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do, to access the personal data. Providing that the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data.

You have the right to the erasure of your personal data. We have described our policy for retaining and deleting personal data above in Section 6. 

(d) the right to object to processing; 

You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is not that the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or for the purposes of the legal obligations arising from the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws or due to legitimate interests of ours and/or those of third-parties.

(f) the right to complain to a supervisory authority; 

If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement. 

(g) the right to withdraw consent. 

To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal. 

7.3. Without prejudice to the aforementioned, if we have reasonable doubts concerning the identity of a user exercising his/her rights referred to in Section 7.2 or if we otherwise deem it necessary due to security reasons, we may request the provision of additional information and otherwise use all reasonable measures necessary to confirm the identity of the user. 

7.4. You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by contacting our customer support. Concerning "Right to erasure" users are also able to request the deletion of their account through our site.
