<b>About Information We Collect and How We Use It.</b>
<br><br>
We may collect some or all of the following types of information (collectively, "Information"):
<br><br>
(1) Personal Information. When you visit our site, we will ask you to provide some personal information about
yourself, including your name, address, telephone number(s), e-mail address(es) and other information specific to your
personal circumstances.
<br><br>
(2) Cookies and Tracking Information. When you visit our site, we send one or more cookies to your computer or other
device. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, improving search
results and ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people search. To improve our services, we also track
information about what web-site you were on before coming to our site, what web-site you visited when you left our
site, and whether you return to our site.
<br><br>
(3) Log Files. We also collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP
(internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider), the browser you used to visit our site, the time you
visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.
<br><br>
(4) Third Party Tracking. We also sometimes use third party advertisements to support our site. Some of those
advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send
those advertisers information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some
cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geo targeting purposes (showing information or
advertisements specific to the area where you live) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited.
<br><br>
(5) User communications. When you send email or other communications to us, we may retain those communications
in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. When you send and receive SMS
messages to or from one of our services that provides SMS functionality, we may collect and maintain information
associated with those messages, such as the phone number, the wireless carrier associated with the phone number, the
content of the message, and the date and time of the transaction. We may use your email address to communicate with
you about our services.
<br><br>
(6) Affiliated Services on Other Sites. We offer some of our services on or through other web sites. Personal
information that you provide to those sites may be sent to us in order to deliver the service. We process such
information under this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
(7) Third Party Applications. We may make available third party applications, such as gadgets or extensions, through
its services. The information collected by us when you enable a third party application is processed under this Privacy
Policy. Information collected by the third party application provider is governed by their privacy policies.
<br><br>
(8) Unique application number. Certain services we may offer can include a unique application number that is not
associated with your account or you. This number and information about your installation (e.g., operating system type,
version number) may be sent to us when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts
our servers (for example, to request automatic updates to the software).
<br><br>
(9) Other sites. This Privacy Policy applies to our services only. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as
search results, sites that include our applications, products or services, or links from within our various services. These
other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information
from you.
<br><br>
(10) Other Uses of Information. We may also use the information we collect to provide, maintain, protect, and improve
our services (including advertising services) and develop new services, and to protect our rights or property and that of
our users.
<br><br>
<b>Cookies</b>
<br><br>
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate
when a cookie is being sent. However, some site features and services may not function properly if your cookies are
disabled.
<br><br>
We may use the DoubleClick advertising cookie on AdSense partner sites and certain of our own services to help
advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. You can view and manage your ads preferences
associated with this cookie by accessing the Ads Preferences Manager. In addition, you may choose to opt out of
the DoubleClick cookie at any time by using DoubleClick's opt-out cookie, located at http://www.google.com/ads/

<br><br>
<b>Information sharing</b>
<br><br>
We are in the business of identifying the needs of prospective clients for other third parties,
and providing information to those third parties, including your email address, so that they may
offer goods or services to the prospective clients. By entering our web-site, you are consenting
to our sharing of the above-described information to third parties who will use that information
to offer you goods or services. These services include, but are not limited to, information and
opportunities regarding higher education.

<br><br>
Localjobpositions.com may disclose the information we collect from and about you as follows: (1) to the employment or educational organizations from whom you have requested information or the employment or educational organization we have matched based on your interests; (2) to our email and data hosting service providers, if the disclosure will enable them to perform a business, professional or technical support function for us; (3) as necessary if we believe that there has been a violation of the Localjobpositions.com Site Terms of Use or of our rights or the rights of any third party; (4) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law; (5) to our select partners and affiliates that we believe may have offers of interest to you; and (6) as described to you at the point of collection.
<br><br>
You also agree to receive email marketing from Localjobpositions. Any email you receive will be
from Localjobpositions and may be sent by our mailing partner. At times, you may
request that your information be submitted to another site. It is possible that the selected site will
not accept your information for various reasons, including that you are out of the area which the
site serves, or your request duplicates another you already made. Localjobpositions has no
control over this occurring. In addition, even though a site does not accept your information, both
we and that site may store your information and your information may subsequently be utilized to
send to you offers or follow-up e-mails from Localjobpositions, one of our partners or affiliates,
or by the site which did not originally accept your information. By entering and using our site, you
are consenting to such offers or follow-up e-mails being sent to you. In addition, we will share
your Information with others when we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation
or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law,
regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of
Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise
address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or
safety of Localjobpositions, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.
<br><br>
By registering on this Site, you agree that this act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of telemarketing laws,
 and notwithstanding that your telephone and/or cell number may be listed with the federal Do-Not-Call Registry you expressly opt-in to:
  (a) receive an offer or service from one or more of our partners or affiliates; (b) receive future information about products and services from us, our partners, affiliates and other third parties to whom we may provide your information; (c) permit us, our partners, affiliates and other third parties to contact you pursuant to the business relationship we have established using the information you provided to us for any purpose such as contacting you by e-mail address, phone and/or mobile phone number (including use of automated dialing equipment),
text (SMS) message or any means of communication for any purpose that, among other things, your wireless device may be capable of receiving (e.g. mms, video etc. ).
<br><br>
We also sometimes disclose the Personal Information we collect to companies that operate various services for us such
as marketing distribution, advertising, or certain product functionalities. These vendors only have access to Personal
Information needed to perform their functions, and may not share it with others or use it for any other purpose.  
We only share your email address with our mailing partner, All Inbox, LLC, for the purpose of sending you relevant third-party emails.

<br><br>
We may share aggregated information (i.e., information about you and other customers collectively, but not specifically
identifiable to you) and other non-personal, de-identified, or anonymous information we collect with third parties,
including affiliates to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our Site and on the websites of third parties. If you
would prefer that we do not utilize cookies with your website experience, or would prefer to restrict the use of cookies
with network advertising associates, please see the "Choices" section above.
<br><br>
We may be required to share your Personal Information with law enforcement or government agencies in response to
subpoenas, court orders, federal/state audits or similar circumstances. We believe it is necessary to share information in
order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential
threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.
<br><br>
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future, our company could merge with or be acquired by another
company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us,
including your Personal Information, customer and business account information, but would continue to be bound by
this policy unless you consent otherwise.
<br><br>
<b>Accessing and updating personal information</b>
<br><br>
When you use our services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your Personal Information and
either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be
retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information
requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process
requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy
of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes),
<br><br>
or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we
perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we
maintain certain services, after you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are
deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.
<br><br>
Federal and state regulations may require that we maintain certain information (including your personal information)
submitted through our website for various time periods. In order to comply with these regulations, we cannot delete
your information from our database if to do so is not permitted by an applicable law or regulation.
<br><br>
<b>Children</b>
<br><br>
This website is not intended for persons under 18 years of age. These products and services are not developed
or directed at children. We do not knowingly collect or retain information in connection with this site from
children under the age of 18. We do not ask a child under age 18 for personal information. If you are under the
age of 18, please leave this site immediately.
<br><br>
<b>California Privacy Rights</b><br><br>

information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for such third parties' direct marketing
purposes. To make such a request, please write to us at 297 Kingsbury Grade STE 100 , Stateline NV 89449-
