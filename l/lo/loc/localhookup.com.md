 ** _Use of Cookies_**

A cookie is a piece of text data stored on the user's hard drive containing information stored by a particular website. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects cookies they will not be able to fully use our website. Cookies are tiny pieces of saved textual infomation on your computer that your Internet Browser passes back to our site, they are not and can not be executable programs. We do not and will not use cookies to collect private information from any user! Why, because it is impossible for a simple piece of textual data, a cookie, to do your computer any harm whatsoever. It is impossible for a cookie to collect your personal data, impossible for a cookie to scan your computer, impossible for a cookie to spy on you, and impossible for a cookie to know of any other sites you have been to and what you did on those sites. It's just a simple piece ot text data like 'this is simple piece of text data' saved as a text file on your computer. It is a complete myth that a site's use of cookies are in any way harmful to your computer. It is also impossible for our website to use the cookies saved on your computer from another website other than our own. Why, because a website never 'reads' the cookies on your computer in the first place, that is impossible. In fact web sites can't read anything on your computer at all, that is impossible. Your own Internet Browser is what passes cookies it (the browser) saved for a particular web-site back to that exact site when you browse any page on that exact site. Your Internet Browser never passes back cookies saved on your computer to any site that was not the exact same site that your Internet Browser saved the cookie for in the first place.

If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner, and we will then use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

 ** _Security_**

singlelovelife.com takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
