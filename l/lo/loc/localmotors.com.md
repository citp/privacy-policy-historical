features such as posting comments, evaluating submissions, participating in the  
forums, submitting designs and participating in competitions. Local Motors and our

contact and social information related to you, such as your email address, gender,

addresses (collectively, “Personal Information”). For example, when you register, we  
ask for information such as your name, email address, and other  
personally-identifying information. In addition, Local Motors and our third party  
service providers may gather or automatically receive and record other  
non-personally-identifying information (“Non-Personal Information”) on server logs

Local Motors and our third party service providers may combine information about  
you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other  
companies.

satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental  
request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential  
violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or  
technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or

situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations  
of Local Motors’ Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.  
(vii) We may transmit Personal Information if Local Motors is acquired by or merged

be able to control how your Personal Information is treated, transferred, or used.  
Please note that our third party service providers are owned and operated by others,

require that your Local Motors cookies be enabled. When you use Local Motors  
services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends  
whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as

cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information  
from you. Local Motors lets other companies that show advertisements on some of  
our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies’ use of  
their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or  
other companies do not have access to Local Motors’ cookies. Local Motors may

##### 4\. LOCAL MOTORS CARES ABOUT CONFIDENTIALITY, SECURITY, AND DATA  
INTEGRITY.

Because Local Motors is committed to preserving the confidentiality, integrity and  
security of your Personal Information, we have implemented commercially  
reasonable technical safeguards to help us accomplish the same. We cannot,  
however, ensure or warrant the confidentiality, integrity or security of any Personal  
Information, or that Local Motor’s safeguards will prevent the loss or alteration of  
your Personal Information, that you transmit to Local Motors, and you do so at your  
own risk. We use commercially reasonable efforts to limit access to Personal  
Information about you to our employees, contractors, and agents who we believe  
reasonably need to come into contact with Personal Information to provide products  
or services to you or in order to do their jobs. Local Motors processes Personal  
Information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with  
this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We take  
reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Information we process is accurate,  
complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their  
Personal Information whenever necessary. In no event will Local Motors be  
responsible or liable for the deletion, correction, destruction, damage, loss or failure  
to store any Personal Information. Please note that our third party service providers  
are owned and operated by others, and they may have different safeguards in place  
to preserve the confidentiality, integrity and security of Personal Information, that are  
not subject to our control.

##### 5\. YOU CAN EDIT AND DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION AT ANY TIME.

We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you,  
including those described above. Information associated with your account will be  
kept until your account is deleted, unless we no longer need the data to provide  
products and services.  
You can review and edit your Local Motors account information at any time by

Personal Information as provided for herein, but you may opt out and deactivate and  
delete your Local Motors account at any time by canceling your account on the  
account profile page. When you use Local Motors’ services, we make good faith  
efforts to provide you with access to your Personal Information and either to correct  
this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise  
required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual  
users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed,  
corrected or removed before processing such requests.

disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your  
continued use of the Website, which is governed by U.S. law and this Privacy Policy
