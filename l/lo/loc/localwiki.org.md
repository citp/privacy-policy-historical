Even if an article is "deleted," a website administrator or volunteer may still see what was removed from public view. Aside from the rare times when LocalWiki is required to delete editing-history in response to a court order or legal process, there is no guarantee that permanent deletion will occur.

**1.2 Individual Contributions.** If you contribute or edit content on through the Services (“Contributions”), your Contributions will be visible to the public and may show up in search results of third-party search engines.  If you have registered an account with LocalWiki, your Contributions will be associated with your username.  If you have not registered with LocalWiki, your Contributions will be associated with your IP Address.
