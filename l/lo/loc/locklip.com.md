**Special Note About Children**

Locklip.com is not intended for children, especially kids under 13. Children may use Locklip.com only with the direct supervision of their parent.

We do not seek to collect personal information about children under 13 years of age through Locklip.com. If we discover such information, we will delete it. Thus, we typically retain no information about children. However, if a parent requests a review of information we may have on their child and in the unlikely event we still retain such information and haven’t deleted it, then we will honor that request. In order to request a review or deletion of personal information that Locklip.com may have collected about your child, please email or write: <http://locklip.com/contact-us/>

When you communicate with Locklip.com, we make every effort to ensure your privacy and safety. As an added precaution, however, we still encourage parents to monitor their child’s use of the Internet, and to help us protect their privacy by reminding them never to exchange personal information with this or any other web site without the assistance or express written permission of a parent or other responsible adult.
