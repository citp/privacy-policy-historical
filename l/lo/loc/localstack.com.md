However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any firewalls or secure server software we may employ. LOCALSTACK continues to evaluate and implement enhancements in security technology and practices, however we can only take steps to help reduce the risks of unauthorized access. LOCALSTACK has taken the following steps in this regard:

## Secure Socket Layer (SSL)

LOCALSTACK.COM uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption when transmitting certain kinds of information, such as registration information or payment information. An icon resembling a padlock is displayed on the bottom of most browsers window during SSL transactions that involve credit cards and other forms of payment. Any time LOCALSTACK.COM asks you for a credit card number on LOCALSTACK.COM for payment or for verification purposes, it will be SSL encrypted. The information you provide will be stored securely on our servers. Once you choose to store or enter your credit card number on LOCALSTACK.COM, it will not be displayed back to you in its entirety when you retrieve or edit it in the future. Instead of the entire number, you will only see asterisks and either the first four digits or the last four digits of your number.

## Secure Storage

LOCALSTACK.COM maintains reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you.

## Vendors and Partners

LOCALSTACK.COM works with vendors and partners to protect the security and privacy of user information.
