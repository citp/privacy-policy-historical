  5. **Unsubscribing**
    1. Where we are processing your personal data based on consent or pursuant to our legitimate interests (and feel your interests should override ours), you have the right to withdraw such consent or object to our use of legitimate interests as a ground for processing your personal data at any time or notify us. To do so, simply: (i) opt out or unsubscribe (using our preference centre or the unsubscribe link to emails); (ii) notify your LoopUp point of contact; or (iii) contact us at [privacy@loopup.com](mailto:privacy@loopup.com).

  7. **Keeping your personal data up to date**
    1. It is important that the personal data that we hold on you is kept accurate and up to date. Therefore, please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.
  8. **Sharing your personal data**
    1. We will only share personal data with others when we are legally permitted to do so. When we share personal data with others, we put contractual arrangements and security mechanisms in place to protect the personal data and to comply with our data protection, confidentiality and security standards.
    2. We are part of a global network of firms and we use third parties located in other countries to help us run our business. As a result, personal data may be transferred outside the countries where we and our clients are located. This includes to countries outside the European Economic Union (“EEA”) and to countries that do not have laws that provide specific protection for personal data. We have taken steps to ensure all personal data is provided with adequate protection and that all transfers of personal data outside the EEA are done lawfully. Where we transfer personal data outside of the EEA to a country not determined by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data, the transfers will be under an agreement which covers the requirements for the transfer of personal data outside the EEA, such as the European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses.
    3. Specifically, personal data held by us may be transferred to:

• **Other members within the LoopUp Group.** We may share personal data with other LoopUp entities where necessary for administrative purposes and to provide our services (and customer support) to our customers. This transfer may include transfers to our international data centres for disaster recovery and business continuity purposes. Furthermore, job applicant personal data may be transferred within the group.

• **Third party organisations that provide applications/functionality, data processing or IT services to us.** We use third parties to support us in providing our services and to help provide, run and manage our internal IT systems. For example, providers of information technology, cloud based software as a service providers, website hosting and management, data analysis, data back-up, security and storage services. The servers powering and facilitating that cloud infrastructure are located in secure data centres around the world, and personal data may be stored in any one of them.

• **Third party organisations that otherwise assist us in providing goods, services or information.** For example credit agencies, our share registrars, recruiters or such other ancillary service provider or service providers to which we may resell certain services (such as operator assisted event calls).

• **Auditors and other professional advisers.** Such as our accountants, lawyer, brokers and such other professional service providers.

• **Law enforcement or other government and regulatory agencies.** Occasionally, we may receive requests from third parties with authority to obtain disclosure of personal data, such as to check that we are complying with applicable law and regulation, to investigate an alleged crime, to establish, exercise or defend legal rights. We will only fulfil requests for personal data where we are permitted to do so in accordance with applicable law or regulation.

• **Investors.** Should we enter into negotiations with third parties for the sale or purchaser of all or part of our business, in limited circumstances such personal data may be accessible by such third party.

  9. **Third party links**
    1. This website may contain links to third party websites, plug-ins and applications.

    2. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. 
    3. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. 

## Part 4 – Deleting your personal data

  12. **Data Retention**
    1. We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means and the applicable legal requirements. 
    2. Our default retention periods for customer records are: (i) call detail records shall be retained for approximately 12 months from the date of the call; (ii) call recordings shall be available for 60 days then deleted around 90 days thereafter (subject to purge rules and timings); and (iii) basic information about our customers for six years after ceasing being customers (for tax and regulatory reasons). 
  13. **Deletion**
    1. All personal data shall be deleted or erased in a secure and confidential manner. 

## Part 5 – Know your rights

  14. **Your rights**
    1. Individuals have certain rights over their personal data and data controllers are responsible for fulfilling these rights. Where we decide how and why personal data is processed, we are a data controller and include further information about the rights that individuals have and how to exercise them below. 
  15. **Access to personal data**
    1. You have a right to access your personal data (“data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. 
    2. To make a request, you need to put the request in writing addressing it to our Legal department at the address provided above. If you agree, we will try to deal with your request informally, for example by providing you with the specific information you need over the telephone. 
    3. If we do hold information about you, you can ask us to correct any mistakes by, once again, contacting the Legal department. 
  16. **Amendment of personal data**
    1. To update personal data submitted to us, you may email us at [privacy@loopup.com](mailto:privacy@loopup.com) or, where appropriate, contact us via the relevant website registration page or by amending the personal details held on relevant applications with which you registered. 
    2. When practically possible, once we are informed that any personal data processed by us is no longer accurate, we will make corrections (where appropriate) based on your updated information. 
  17. **Withdrawal of consent**
    1. Where we process personal data based on consent, individuals have a right to withdraw consent at any time. We do not generally process personal data based on consent (as we can usually rely on another legal basis). To withdraw consent to our processing of your personal data please email us at [privacy@loopup.com](mailto:privacy@loopup.com) or, to stop receiving an email from our marketing list, please click on the unsubscribe link in the relevant email received from us. 
  18. **Object to processing**
    1. You may object to our processing of your personal data where we are relying upon a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some case, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms. 
  19. **Transfer requests**
    1. You may request the transfer of your personal data to you or a third party. We will provide you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Please note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. 
  20. **Request erasure**
    1. You may request the erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us to continuing to process it. 
  21. **Request restriction on processing**
    1. You may request the restriction of processing of your personal data by us. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (i) if you want us to establish the personal data’s accuracy; (ii) where our use of the personal data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (iii) where you need us to hold the personal data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to our use of your personal data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate interest grounds to use it. 
  22. **Complaints**
    1. We hope that you won’t ever need to, but if you do want to complain about our use of personal data, please send an email with the details of your complaint to [privacy@loopup.com](mailto:privacy@loopup.com). We will look into and respond to any complaints we receive. 
    2. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the local data protection regulator. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the appropriate regulator. In the UK that is the Information Commissioner’s Office. For further information on your rights and how to complain to your local data protection regulator, please contact us or refer to the local data protection regulator’s website. 
    3. This privacy policy was drafted with clarity in mind. It does not provide exhaustive detail of all aspects of our collection and use of personal information.
