Legal basis for the processing of Information to initiate or perform a contract to which you are a party, e.g. regarding a Streamer or business partner cooperating with us, is Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR.

Information will also be processed to assert our legitimate interests and that of third parties under Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Legitimate interests lie in the functionality of our and third parties’ IT systems including our Site appearance and the interchange with your device (, e.g. laptop, mobile phone) as well as carrying out our commercial activities including business communication and direct marketing.

Every time our Site is accessed and every time a file on our Site is retrieved, our IT systems collect automated Information from the retrieving medium and store these in a log file on our server. The data stored in log files is evaluated exclusively for statistical purposes.

We do not otherwise initiate the disclosure of Information. However, if a User intends to disclose Information e.g. as part of a Tip Message, we will follow such User directive and provide the information intended for disclosure in connection with our Service.

You may withdraw your consent to process your Personal Information at any time by terminating your account via “ _Account > Settings_” or providing a notice to [privacy@loots.com](mailto:privacy@loots.com).
