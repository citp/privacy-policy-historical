      <div class="main"> 
			<p>Loopster, Inc. ("Loopster," "we," "our" or "us") is committed to respecting the privacy and security of your personal information. The following U.S. online privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") describes the information we collect and how we use it. By using this website, you
			consent to our Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>We may periodically update this Privacy Policy to reflect material changes in how we collect, use, share or store your personal information. We encourage you to refer to this Privacy Policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current Privacy Policy. You consent to any changes we make to this Privacy Policy if you continue to use the Loopster service after receiving a notice of the change or upon our posting of the new Privacy Policy on this website.</p>
     <h2>COLLECTING INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>Like many websites, we gather information about how visitors use our website. In general, you can visit many of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We may track your visit for trends and statistics, but you will remain anonymous unless you tell us who you are. Once you choose to give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. For more information, see the "Navigation" section of this Privacy Policy below.</p>
            <p>We request information from you (which may include your name, address, telephone number, email address, gender and, when necessary, credit card information) when you:</p>
<ul class="privacy">	
	<li>Register or set up an account</li>
	<li>Purchase a subscription</li>
	<li>Request to receive communications</li>
	<li>Participate in a promotion or other website feature</li>
	<li>Participate in online discussions</li>
	<li>Modify your account or profile</li>
	
</ul>
<p>In order to better understand your preferences and better serve you, we may combine
information you give us online with other information from Loopster sources, transactions
and communications. This may include data from Loopster direct mail, events, or online
marketing. We may also combine that information with data that is publicly available and data
that we receive from other reputable sources. This data may include postal address updates and
demographic data. All data combined and stored with online data is protected by this Privacy
Policy.</p>
<p>To provide you with certain social features, we may collect information about you, your
contacts, or friends from third party websites that provide access to this information, such as
Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter, or email services. We respect and follow the privacy
policies of those third party services with regard to the data we collect from them.</p>
<p>To comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we will never knowingly or
intentionally collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If we obtain
actual knowledge that we have collected personal information about a child under the age of
13, we will immediately delete that information. Because we do not knowingly or intentionally
collect personal information about children under the age of 13, to the best of our knowledge and
belief, we have no such information to use or to disclose to a third party.</p>
<p>The information we collect in this survey provides Loopster with information regarding the personal preferences, interests, profile and demographics of our user community.  We use this information to, among other things, improve our service, communicate with you regarding promotions, special offers, and both ours and third party offerings that may be of interest to you.  if you are not interested in participating, please feel free to skip the survey.  Additional information regarding our collection and use of information, and the process to “opt-out” can be located in our privacy policy located on our website.</p>
<p>To make a payment to Loopster, we require you to provide your billing details, such as a name, address, email address and financial information corresponding method of payment (e.g. a credit card number and expiration date or a bank account number). If you provide a billing address, we will regard that as the location of the account holder.</p>
<h2>USING INFORMATION</h2>
<p>We may use the information we collect to:</p>
<ul class="privacy">	
	<li>Customize and/or personalize your communications and user experience</li>
	<li>Better respond to your customer service inquiries</li>
	<li>Communicate with you about your purchase, account information, or customer service needs</li>
	<li>Communicate with you about our products/services, events, and for other promotional purposes</li>
	<li>Display targeted advertising, announcements, sponsorships or other messages</li>
	<li>Improve our business</li>
	<li>Administer competitions, contests, promotions, surveys or other website features</li>
	
</ul>
<p>We will not use your personal information to advertise or communicate promotional offers,
directly or indirectly, using direct mail marketing or telemarketing, unless you give us
permission to do so.</p>
<p>We may extend any of our rights under this Privacy Policy to third parties performing services
on our behalf.</p>
<p>We use your billing details to process subscription and service charges to your account. We also occasionally send you communications of a transactional nature, e.g. billing-related matters.</p>
<h2>SHARING INFORMATION</h2>
<p>We may enable other users of our site and third parties to view or receive information from your
profile, subject to your permission to share this information. These third-parties may include
social networking providers such as Facebook, Linked-In, Twitter, MySpace and YouTube,
as well as individual subscribers to these third-party services. With your permission, we may
publish or distribute selected information about you, such as your recommendations, interests
and other data or content of possible interest to other users of our site and third parties.</p>
<p>For the purpose of operating our business, we may transfer information between Loopster and
our preferred service providers who use that information only to conduct Loopster business.
For example, they may handle our credit card processing, shipping, data management, email
distribution, market research, information analysis, and promotions management. We provide
our preferred service providers with the information they need to perform their services and work
with them to respect and protect your information.</p>
<p>From time to time we might establish a business relationship with carefully selected persons
or companies whom we believe trustworthy. In such cases we might share and cross-reference
information, including personally identifiable information about you that will enable such
persons or entities to contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you.
If you prefer that we do not share any information with these companies, please email Loopster
at <a href="mailto:support@loopster.com">support@loopster.com</a> to update your privacy settings.</p>
<p>We may provide your information to our wholly-owned companies and affiliates, which may be
outside the United States. We may also sell or transfer your personal information to third parties
in connection with any merger, acquisition, reorganization, change in capital structure or sale of
all or substantially all of the assets of Loopster.</p>
<p>We may provide information to other companies for purposes such as reporting and marketing.
We may sell or transfer non-individualized information to third parties, including summary or
aggregated anonymous information about all or sub-groups of users of our site.</p>
<p>On rare occasions, we may disclose specific information upon governmental request, in response
to a court order, when required by law, to enforce our website policies, or to protect our or
others' rights, property, or safety. We may also share information with companies assisting in
fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies
for marketing or commercial purposes.</p>
<p>Mostly commonly, we share your information with our service providers who help us to provide our services to you. We contractually bind these service providers to keep your information confidential and to use it only for the purpose of providing their services to us. For example, we use payment processors who help us to process credit card transactions. By using our services, you authorize Loopster to sub-contract in this manner on your behalf. </p>
<p>If your details (as the account holder) are different to the billing contact listed for your account, we may disclose your identity and account details to the billing contact upon their request (we also will usually attempt to notify you of such requests). By using our services and agreeing to this privacy policy, you consent to this disclosure.</p>
<h2>PROTECTING YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
<p>We use a variety of security measures, including sophisticated encryption and authentication
tools to maintain the safety of your personal information. Your personal information is contained
behind secure networks and is only accessible to a limited number of persons who have special
access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. When you
place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All credit
card information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then
encrypted into our databases to be accessed only as stated above. We will use the information for
purposes of processing and completing only those transactions you approve, and the information
will be disclosed to third parties only as necessary to complete a specific transaction. Regardless
of these efforts, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Our site may contain hypertext links to the websites of one or more third parties. We are not
responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other websites.</p>
<p>Advertising agencies, advertising networks, and other companies who may place advertisements
on our site may use their own cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, web bugs and other technology
to collect information about you. We do not control these companies' use of such technology
and we have no responsibility for the use of such technology by these companies to gather
information about you.</p>
<h2>NAVIGATION</h2>
<p>Like other interactive websites, we collect information about your use of our site and our
services using cookies, log files, and techniques used to track who is reading a web page or e-
mail, when, and from what computer, such as web bugs, web beacons or pixel tags.</p>
<p>A cookie is a small removable data file that is stored by your web browser on your computer.</p>
<p>Cookies allow you to order a subscription to our products and services on our website and allow
us to enhance and personalize your online browsing and shopping experience.</p>
<p>For example, we use cookies to:</p>
<ul class="privacy">	
	<li>Recognize you when you return to our website</li>
	<li>Analyze visitor behavior</li>
	<li>Store session data</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent or you can
choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (i.e. Internet Explorer) settings.
Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to
modify your cookie settings.</p>
<p>Pixel tags, also known as web beacons or web bugs, are tiny graphic images (referred to here
as "GI") that are unobtrusively placed on a website or in an e-mail. When the HTML code for
the GI points to a site to retrieve the image, it simultaneously passes information to our servers,
such as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time and duration the GI was
viewed, the type of browser that retrieved the image, and previously set cookie values.</p>
<p>We use GI to help us analyze your online behavior. We may use GI to collect information
about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in
connection with our sites and services. We also collect certain standard information that your
browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language,
access times and referring web site addresses. We also use GI to allow us to send you email in a
format you can read and to let us know when you have opened an email message from us.</p>
<p>We also work with other companies who use tracking technologies to serve ads on our behalf
across the Internet. These companies may collect non-personally identifiable information about
your visits to our website and your interaction with our communications, including advertising.
If you would like to opt-out of allowing third party companies to collect non-personally
identifiable information about you during your visits to our site, please email Loopster at <a href="mailto:support@loopster.com" target="_blank">support@loopster.com</a> to update your privacy settings.</p>
<h2>HOW TO REVIEW, MODIFY OR DELETE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
<p>We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If you prefer not to receive
information from us or would like to update or change your personal information or preferences,
follow the instructions below to review, modify or delete your personal information.</p>
<p>To modify the information you have provided during registration, please login and update your
personal settings.</p>
<p>To unsubscribe from an email, please follow the instructions in any email you receive.</p>
<p>If you request your registration information be deleted or if you unsubscribe from
communications, we may maintain information about sales transactions or service inquiries for future service and record keeping purposes.</p>

           <p class="learn-more-sec-p">
          Whether you are realtor, product marketer, event planner, small business owner or other professional, Loopster can help you communicate with your customers in various ways, including:
          </p>
           <p class="learn-more-thr-p">
          <strong>Customer reference videos</strong> – Customer testimonials, success stories, case study, client interviews or customer presentations.
          </p>
          <p class="learn-more-thr-p">
          <strong>Advertising, marketing and promotion</strong> – Product demonstrations and commercials, product reviews, visual product stories, viral video, email video, infomercials and content marketing.
          </p>
          <p class="learn-more-thr-p">
          <strong>Corporate videos</strong> – Corporate overviews, executive presentations, staff presentations and corporate facilities tours.
          </p>
          <p class="learn-more-thr-p">
          <strong>Training and support videos</strong> – Training videos, just-in-time learning and FAQ videos.
          </p>
          <p class="learn-more-thr-p">
          <strong>Internal and external communications</strong> – Employee orientation, community relations videos, PR support materials and event communications.
          </p>

          <p class="learn-more-thr-p"> <strong>Benefits of using video content:</strong></p>

           <p class="learn-more-thr-p"><strong>Increased SEO value</strong> – All major search engines now give a lot of value to video content. If your website or business has a video and an article about the same keyword, chances are that your video will rank high every time.</p>

           <p class="learn-more-thr-p"><strong>Easier distribution</strong> – There are numerous video distribution sites that allow users to upload their videos to several websites at once.&nbsp;These websites usually offer optimized videos for their mobile platforms as well, automatically expanding the reach of your brand.</p>

           <p class="learn-more-thr-p"><strong>Social media marketing</strong> – Since popular social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter allow users to share interesting links, having your own video on the major social media sites rapidly increases your chances of exposure. People are also more likely to share an interesting video they come across rather than an article.</p>

          <p class="learn-more-thr-p"><strong>Increased engagement on website</strong> - People are more likely to be intrigued by the service and might stay around to find out more if they are presented with an entertaining video explaining the purpose of the website or the service.</p>

          <p class="learn-more-thr-p"><strong>Personalized experience for your customers </strong>– Creating customer reference videos, corporate videos, facilities tours and product demonstrations give you an edge in client satisfaction and helps increase client retention.</p>
