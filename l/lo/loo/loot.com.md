Loot has a firm commitment to privacy. The following sets out our information gathering and dissemination practices.

 **Information gathered and tracked**  
When you register with Loot we ask for the following details:
* Your e-mail address  

* Your password  

* Your title  

* Your name  

* Your postcode  

* Your home/work telephone number  

* Your street/flat number  

* Your country  

* Your date of birth  

* Your occupation  

This information is entered into Loot's customer database.

In order to help us provide the best website and service possible, Loot also gathers the following information: browser type (e.g. Navigator, Internet Explorer) and internet domain. We use cookies to save your online ID so you don't have to fill in your details every time you visit Loot. 

Loot and some of our commercial partners use third-party ad sales partners. These ad sales partners never know the name, e-mail address, phone number or home address of any users of Loot. All users who recieve an ad targeted by any ad sales company remain completely anonymous.

 **What do we do with this information?**  
We do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information or any details of activities of users to any third party. Information is only shared with advertisers and partners on an aggregate basis.

Loot sometimes run third-party sponsored competitions and promotions. Entry to such competitions may depend on users supplying their name and e-mail address. Where this is the case, users will always be given the option of declining to receive further corrrespondence from the third-party.

The only mass mailing application Loot currently uses is the SearchAlert e-mail me facility. This is by default disabled and must be enabled by the user. We may also contact you if we have an important announcement to make.

If you participate in Loot Auctions and you are one of the top three bidders, Loot will pass your name, e-mail and/or telephone number to the advertiser so that they can contact you.

Loot compiles demographic data from your postcode, title, date of birth and occupation so we can determine if we need to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This information is shared with advertisers and partners on an aggregate basis.

 **Security**  
Loot has an extensive firewalling procedure to ensure our customer database is protected and cannot be accessed by unauthorised persons. Loot employs an external security company periodically to assess our security and ensure the maximum amount of protection for our customers' data.

We forbid other individuals or organisations from taking e-mail addresses from this site for bulk e-mail. We will take appropriate action if this is detected. This site contains links to other sites – Loot is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

Credit card transactions are protected by a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) system. This is the industry standard, and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information including credit card number, name and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet. It's safer than using your credit card over the telephone. Loot does not keep a record of your credit card number so there is no possibility of anyone having access to it, either internally or externally. It is sent directly and securely to your bank the moment you complete your purchase. The only record Loot keeps is the authorisation number received from the bank, which contains neither your card number nor the expiry date. Your credit card is safe with Loot! 

**Loot Forums**  
Loot makes use of chat rooms and forums. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

It is Loot's policy to take reasonable measures to respect the privacy of Loot Forums participants. Loot will take reasonable measures to not disclose the contents of your communications unless required to do so by law or in the good faith and belief that such action is reasonably necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Loot; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Loot or Loot Forums or enforce or further the application or intent of the terms; or (c) act to protect the personal safety of Loot Forums participants or the public. 

**Delete/deactivate procedure**  
If you wish to remove yourself from our customer database, all you need to do is contact Loot, telephone 0207-328 4444 or write to Copy Advice, Loot Ltd, Loot House, 24-32 Kilburn High Road, London, NW6 5TF. Provide us with sufficient information to confirm your identity, and say you want your account removed from our customer database. **Change/modify procedure**
