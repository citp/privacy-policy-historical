# Privacy Policy | Looker

**Effective September 12, 2013**

Respect for the privacy of your personal information is extremely important to Looker Data Sciences, Inc. (“Looker”). We are committed to securing any personal information that we collect, maintain, or use on this website or mobile application (“Site”) as described in this Privacy Policy and in compliance with applicable laws. This Privacy Policy is intended to help you understand what information is gathered by this Site, how Looker uses that information, and what safeguards are in place to protect that information.

##### PII Collected by This Site

On this Site, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information (“PII”) to Looker. PII means information that can identify or locate you, like your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and other similar information. If you provide PII to Looker, we may enhance or merge it with information that we obtain from third parties about you. When you use this Site and provide your PII to Looker, you consent to Looker’s use of such information as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Looker may use your PII in the following ways:**

  * To respond to your requests for information, products, or services;
  * To administer your account if you have registered on the Site;
  * To inform you about our products and services;
  * For legal compliance, such as to enforce our legal rights, to comply in good faith with applicable laws, and to protect Site users;
  * To consider you for employment if you apply for a job via this Site; and
  * For other general business purposes, such as website management, marketing, advertising, and research and development.



##### Non-PII Collected by This Site

This Site may also collect information that does not identify you personally (“Non-PII”). Such Non-PII includes non-personally identifiable information that you choose to provide or post on this Site. Non-PII collected by this Site may also include information gathered through cookies and pixel tags as described below.

Cookies are small bits of information that this Site places on your computer. Pixel tags, also called web beacons or single-pixel gifs, allow this Site to collect web log information. A pixel tag is a graphic on a web page or in an email message that tracks pages viewed or messages opened. Looker and our service providers may use cookies and pixel tags to identify your IP address, browser type, domain name, and specific web pages through which you click. Looker uses such Non-PII to administer and update our Site and for other everyday business purposes. We reserve the right to maintain, update, disclose, or otherwise use Non-PII without limitation.

Most web browsers allow you to erase cookies on your computer, block cookies from your computer, or notify you when a cookie is stored on your computer. Please refer to your browser’s instructions on these functions. If you choose to disable cookies, please note that you may not be able to take advantage of all of the Site’s features.

##### Information Sharing

Except as provided below, Looker will not share PII with third parties unless you have consented to the disclosure.

In certain circumstances, Looker may share your PII with service providers that need your information to provide operational or other support services to Looker, such as email marketing, data management, database hosting, credit card processing, or shipping services. To ensure the confidentiality and security of your PII, such service providers must agree to safeguard your information. These service providers are also restricted by contract from using your PII in any way other than to provide services for Looker.

Looker also may provide information to government entities and others when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by law. We may also access or disclose your information in order to protect the legal rights of Looker, its employees, and/or its agents; to protect the safety and security of users and members; and to help prevent fraud.

Looker may also provide PII and Non-PII to a third party in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of this Site. In such event, Looker will require any such buyer to agree to treat PII in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

##### Our Advertisements

Looker’s third-party service providers serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. Some of these ads may be personalized for you based on what we know about you. We do not share any information that identifies you personally with the third-party service providers that serve ads on behalf of Looker. Please visit the Network Advertising Initiative Opt-Out page <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp> if you do not wish to receive personalized ads from Looker on third-party websites.
