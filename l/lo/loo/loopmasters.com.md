# Privacy Policy – Customer Feedback for Loopmasters

We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this policy sets out how we will treat personal information we collect from you through the website, or through such Loopmasters and Loopcloud plugins and services as we might make available to you from time to time.

1\. What information do we collect?

  
We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal data:

 2\. Information about website visits

 § We may collect information about your computer and your visits to this website such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit and number of page views. We may use this information in the administration of this website, to improve the website´s usability, and for marketing purposes.

§ We use cookies on this website. A cookie is a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The text file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.

§ We may send a cookie which may be stored on by your browser on your computer´s hard drive. We may use the information we obtain from the cookie in the administration of this website, to improve the website´s usability and for marketing purposes. We may also use that information to recognise your computer when you visit our website, and to personalise our website for you.  For more information regarding our use of cookies please refer to section 5 below.

 § Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. (For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookie by clicking “Tools”, “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector.) This may, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.

3\. Using your personal data

Personal data submitted on this website or through our services will be used for the purposes specified in this privacy policy or in relevant parts of the website.

In addition to the uses identified elsewhere in this privacy policy, we may use your personal information to:

§ process your orders, register and administer your user account, and enable you to login and use the website and our services;

§ if you purchase a third party’s product through our website or service, we may disclose your name and/or email address to that third party if such disclosure is required in order to allow you to obtain and use a licence key for that product from that third party;

§ improve your browsing experience by personalising the website;

§ send information (other than marketing communications) to you which we think may be of interest to you by post or by email or similar technology;

§ send to you marketing communications relating to our business which we think may be of interest to you by post or, where you have specifically agreed to this, by email or similar technology (you can inform us at any time if you no longer require marketing communications to be sent by emailing us at support@loopmasters.com); and

§ to generally run and improve the website and our services.

We will not without your express consent provide your personal information to any third parties for the purpose of direct marketing.

4\. Antispam Policy

Newsletter Subscriber

A registered user is added to our Newsletter Subscribers database when he/she leaves the “Yes. I want to subscribe to the Loopmasters newsletter” option ON, on our registration page. After completing our registration process which involves clicking an activation link sent to his/her email account the user becomes a Newsletter Subscriber. Our email communication with our Newsletter Subscribers is based solely on their permission.

What Is Spam?

 Spam is unsolicited email also known as Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE). It involves emails sent to users who:

§ Have no association with the sender

§ Have registered an account but not opted in to receive commercial emails

§ Have previously opted in but then opted out of receiving commercial emails

It is also email communications without a valid reply-to address.

Email Communications

Loopmasters do not send spam - ever. The goal of our existing email communications is to inform our Newsletter Subscribers of the new audioware releases which are published on a weekly basis. Our Newsletters include the links to our new products, information about promotions and latest news from our industry.

We cooperate with other businesses that target similar audiences as ours - they send our newsletters to their opted-in subscriber base. We are very careful about the antispam practices of these businesses and never cooperate with companies that are outside the scope of our audience or our industry or which have an unclear Antispam Policy. On rare occasions we also send selected partners’ eflyers to our subscriber base.

We do not sell or distribute (for financial gain or for free) or otherwise disclose any partner or customer e-mail addresses to any third parties except when legally required.

Every newsletter contains an Unsubscribe link at the top of the message.

Necessary Communication

There are situations which by their own nature require us to send you emails. These include:

§ Sending a message to your emailbox with the link to activate your account at Loopmasters

§ Sending you invoices for each completed transaction on our website.

§ Sending you emails concerning technical, legal and support matters.

Please make sure you do not flag Loopmasters as ‘Spam’ or ‘Unsolicited’ in your email application. When you register and do not find an activation email in your inbox, check your spam folder.

When you get in contact with us (for example by email or via a form on the website) we will keep records of what is communicated.  This is to ensure we have a record of our discussion for future reference and so we can improve the website.
