		This information is entered into Loot's customer database.<br><br>

		In order to help us provide the best website and service possible,
		Loot also gathers the following information: browser type (e.g. Navigator,
		Internet Explorer) and internet domain.  We use cookies to save your online
		ID so you don't have to fill in your details every time you visit Loot.

		Our ad sales partner, DoubleClick, does not know the name, email address, 
		phone number, or home address of any users of Loot. All users who receive 
		an ad targeted by <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/publishers/admanage/">DoubleClick's Dart</a> technology 
		remain completely anonymous. The information DoubleClick has is useful only across the 
		<a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/">DoubleClick</a> Network, and only in the context of ad selection.

		The only mass mailing application Loot currently uses is the SearchAlert e-mail me
		facility. This is by default disabled and must be enabled by the user. We may
		also contact you if we have an important announcement to make.<br><br> 

		If you participate in Loot Auctions and you are one of the top three bidders,
		Loot will pass your name, e-mail and/or telephone number to the advertiser so
		that they can contact you.<br><br> 

		Loot compiles demographic data from your postcode, title, date of birth
		and occupation so we can determine if we need to tailor our visitor's
		experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be
		interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.

		meaning whatsoever outside of the DoubleClick Network. DoubleClick uses this number to monitor 
		ad exposure to ensure a user does not see the same ad over and over again.

	<menu>
		Loot has an extensive firewalling procedure to ensure our customer
		database is protected and cannot be accessed by unauthorised persons. 
		Loot employs an external security company periodically to assess our
		security and ensure the maximum amount of protection for our customers' data.<br><br>  

		We forbid other individuals or organisations from taking e-mail addresses from this
		site for bulk e-mail. We will take appropriate action if this is detected.
		This site contains links to other sites – Loot is not responsible for the privacy
		practices or the content of such websites.<br><br> 

		Credit card transactions are protected by a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) system.
		This is the industry standard, and among the best software available today for
		secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information including
		credit card number, name and address, so that it cannot be read as the information
		travels over the Internet. It's safer than using your credit card over the telephone.  
		Loot does not keep a record of your credit card number so there is no possibility of anyone
		having access to it, either internally or externally. It is sent directly and securely to
		your bank the moment you complete your purchase. The only record Loot keeps is the authorisation
		number received from the bank, which contains neither your card number nor the expiry date.
		Your credit card is safe with Loot!
