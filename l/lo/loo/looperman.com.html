		in place of your pages that should, in time help notify search engines that the information is no longer available. Your account
		information may still be kept in the form or backups or server logs until such a time that those backups or server logs become obsolete
		or replaced.

		<h3>Transferring your information internationally</h3>
		<p>The platform is hosted outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) and so personal

		disclose to us secure we can’t guarantee its security and so you do so at your own risk. 
		By using the platform you accept the risks of providing information online and wont hold us
		responsible in the event of any breach of security.</p>

		<p>As some of our third party service providers are located outside of the EEA and in
		locations that may not have such strict standards we have tried to ensured that those 
		organisations have sufficient methods in place
		such as being participants in the Privacy Shield Framework.</p>

		<p>More information on Privacy Shield Framework can be found at
		<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">https://www.privacyshield.gov</a></p>

		platform and we kindly ask that anyone below that age refrains from
		attempting to create an account or passing any personal information
		to us. We don’t knowingly process any personal information of
		anyone bellow the age of 13 and should it be bought to our attention
		that this is or has been done we will remove or anonymise this
		information as swiftly as possible.
