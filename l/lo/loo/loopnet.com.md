**LoopNet's Privacy Statement**

LoopNet provides a variety of online services for commercial real estate professionals. LoopNet values your privacy, feedback and candor very highly. Any user information we collect is considered private and we do not share it without the user's permission. We use this personal information at LoopNet to provide the best quality service possible. The following policy statement summarizes LoopNet's protection and use of any personal information provided by visitors to the LoopNet site.

**Information Collected by LoopNet:**

LoopNet collects user information from several areas of the LoopNet site including the 'Become a Member' area; service features; the adding and editing of property listings; technical support email forms; and any surveys or contests that LoopNet may sponsor. LoopNet may track the IP address of a user's computer or place a "cookie" in the browser files of a user's computer. This is required by LoopNet services to provide automated features.

**Use of Information Collected:**

Collected information helps LoopNet better understand its users needs in order to improve its product and service offerings. Email addresses are used to communicate with members through LoopNews, a weekly email news summary and for site administration purposes. Personal information may be used to contact users for the purpose of research, product development, marketing, or customer service. Users may be deleted from email lists at their request. IP address and cookie log data is analyzed to better understand traffic flows and user preferences.

**Shared information:**

Unless explicitly stated, LoopNet uses all collected information for internal purposes only. In a rare occasion, but not without the users knowledge, information may be shared with a third party provider to offer an enhanced service to users or for the purpose of providing more targeting advertising. LoopNet does not sell, rent or lease user information to any third party. From time to time, LoopNet may obtain information (such as electronic mail addresses) from third party providers. It is our goal to only contact individuals who we believe may have a legitimate business interest in LoopNet based on their membership or participation in other organizations or web sites, and who have indicated a willingness to be contacted for this purpose. While LoopNet endeavors to work with other sites and companies with a similar respect for user privacy, LoopNet cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other sites.

**Security of personal information:**

LoopNet's clients and their personal information are considered to be LoopNet's greatest asset and thus their privacy is treated with the utmost regard and respect. LoopNet takes every reasonable precaution to secure personal information within both its computers and its physical premises.

**Opting-out, editing, updating or deleting personal information:**
