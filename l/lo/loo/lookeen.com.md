# Privacy - Lookeen

**(1)** Axonic aims to respect and protect your privacy. We have generally designed our websites so that you can visit the website without being personally identifiable and without any personal information about you being disclosed. If you decide to disclose personal information to us, we undertake to treat it with great care.

 **(2)** The term ‘personal data’ refers to items of information which can give indications as to the identity or private matters of an individual. It includes the person’s correct name, address, telephone number and e-mail address. Based on the above definition, it does not include information which does not give indications as to the identity or private matters of an individual, such as the number of visitors to a website.

 **(3)** The information provided by the owner of the Website is normally freely accessible. No personal registration is required. Personal information is gathered where necessary in order to perform relevant services. This is the case, for example, if you subscribe online to the newsletter, or if you request information material or obtain test software. We only use your personal data to enable us to provide you with the services you request.

 **(4)** Axonic will treat your personal data in strict confidence, and as a matter of principle will not disclose it to third parties (except for partners of Axonic).

 **(5)** When you disclose your personal data to us, you thereby give your consent for us to store and use it within the constraints of the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz). The personal information you provide is accessible only to Axonic and to its partners where appropriate. You can cancel your subscription to our e-mail newsletter, or withdraw your consent for us to store and use your personal data, at any time.

You are advised that you may obtain some services of the provider, for example a newsletter, without providing personal information. In this case only an email address is needed. Furthermore, you can give an anonymous email address, from a free email service, so that your email address appears as a pseudonym instead of as a first and last name.

Pursuant to Sections 34 and its following articles, and Article 6b of the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, BDSG), the user can always view the personal data saved under their name or pseudonym free of charge. For this, the user only needs to make a written request to the provider.

In order to determine the extent to which the website is of interest and can be improved, general, non-personally identifiable, and statistical data on the use of the services offered are collected and kept. In order to achieve this, surveys are conducted and data and information from server log files are summarized on a holistic basis and used for statistics and analysis.

 **(6)** Axonic reserves the right to change this Data Protection Statement at any time within the constraints of the applicable law.
