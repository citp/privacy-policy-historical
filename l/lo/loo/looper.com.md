# Privacy Policy - Looper

**Privacy**

****Looper.com provides this Privacy Policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information received from users of Looper's website, located at  the domain Looper.com (the "Looper Website"). Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to the Looper Website.

**Information Collection and Use**

It is not necessary to provide Looper with your personally identifiable information to use the Looper Website, and Looper does not collect personally identifiable information in connection with the operation of the Looper Website.  If you contact Looper by email through the Looper Website, Looper may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to Looper in your message, to respond to you.  Looper treats this information as it would treat any other unsolicited business correspondence, and has no obligation to keep this information confidential, nor to take any security measures to protect this information.

When you visit the Looper Website, Looper's servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider, the IP address will be different every time you log on. Looper uses Log Data to monitor use of the Looper Website and the services we offer via the Looper Website and for the Looper Website's technical administration.

**Cookies**

Like many websites, Looper also uses "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Looper Website and the services offered via the Web Site. A cookie is a small data file that Looper's servers transfer to your computer's hard disk. Looper does not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. However, IP addresses are collected by the use of cookies.

Looper mainly uses "session cookies", which enable certain features of the Looper Website and services offered via the Looper Website, to better understand how you interact with the Web Site and services we offer via the Looper Website, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Looper Website, and to improve the Looper Website and services offered via the Looper Website. Session cookies should be deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Looper Website.

Looper also uses a persistent cookie that stays on your computer after you leave the Looper Website, for the sole purpose of ensuring that you receive a variety of Looper content (also called "frequency-capping").

Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

Looper cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties, to enforce and comply with the law. Looper may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as Looper, in its sole discretion, believes necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Looper or a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.

If any or all of the assets of Looper are acquired by, or merged with another entity, Looper will share with this entity some or all of the information collected through the Looper Website.

**Security**

Because Looper does not collect any personally identifiable information from the Looper Website, Looper does not take any specific security measures to protect the information we do collect.

**Links to Other Sites**

The Looper Website may contain links to other web sites ("Linked Sites") operated by Looper or third parties. Linked Sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. This Privacy Policy addresses only the use and disclosure of information that Looper collects through the Looper Website. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. Looper does not exercise control over third party Linked Sites. Your use of any Linked Site operated by Looper is subject to the terms and conditions provided by Looper for such Linked Site.  Looper encourages you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.

**Our Policy Towards Children**

The Looper Website is not directed to children under 18. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided Looper with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact Looper at info@Looper.com.  If Looper becomes aware that a child under 13 has provided Looper with personally identifiable information, Looper will remove such information from our files.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

Looper reserves the right to change this policy at any time without prior notice. Any changes to this policy will be posted here.  You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at info@Looper.com.
