##  [ Privacy Policy](http://www.loot.co.za/content/privacy)

This is the privacy policy for Loot Online (Pty) Ltd.  We invite you to contact us if you have questions about this policy. Our postal address is:

Loot Online (Pty) Ltd  
P O Box 30836  
Tokai, 7966

Or contact us by fax on (021) 701-8218, or by e-mail at [privacy@loot.co.za](mailto:privacy@loot.co.za).

### Summary

The following sections provide the specifics of our privacy policy, according to the guidelines set out by the W3C. In a nutshell though, while we do keep information about you on our system (such as your name, address, and email address), we will never disclose this information to third parties unless we are either compelled to by law, or required to in order to complete business transactions that you have initiated. For example, if we are delivering an order, we may need to pass on your contact details to our courier.

The only information relating to your profile that we treat as open to the public is your pseudonym, and the city/town name component of your billing address. When you first register on Loot.co.za your pseudonym is set to be your first name, followed by the first letter of your surname, although you can change it by editing your personal profile. This information is displayed next to the review text for any product reviews that you write, and also in reports to the person or entity that referred you to Loot.co.za for the purpose of tracking referrals. If you create public wishlists that your friends can use as gift registries, then people who are able to find your wishlist will also be able to see the wishlist contents and your name, and will be able to add items from your wishlist to their trolley. If you have set a delivery address for a wishlist, then they will also be able to see that address. All wishlists can be marked as being private, and by default wishlists do not have an associated delivery address.

From time to time, Loot.co.za may contact you regarding promotions and new product releases. You can opt out of receiving such communications by editing your personal profile.

Any wishlist that you create at Loot.co.za will be visible to other Loot.co.za clients who know your email address, unless you have requested that it be hidden. You can change the privacy of your wishlists by editing their settings on the wishlists page.

We use cookies for session tracking and for keeping track of the contents of your trolley. For more information, please read our in depth information about cookies, and consult your browser documentation.

### Dispute Resolution and Privacy Seals
