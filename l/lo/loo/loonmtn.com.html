</p><p>Booth Creek is a general audience web site that complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.&nbsp; Booth Creek does not collect individually identifiable information about children online, except in specific instances, in which case parental consent is required. This is to ensure that the parent or guardian consents to the collection and use of personally identifying information from that child. The parental consent is given for the specific purpose stated in the consent form, it is not a blanket consent. 

</p><p>Under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, no web site operator is permitted to require a child under the age of 13 to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as a condition of participation. Booth Creek abides by this requirement. The type of information Booth Creek collects from children includes name, address, telephone number, email address, and hobbies. This information is collected when ski passes are purchased online or may be collected for contests in order to notify winners. The personal information collected from children under the age of 13 is not shared or forwarded by Booth Creek to business partners, advertisers or other third parties. Booth Creek will not contact users who are under age 13 about special offers or for marketing purposes.
