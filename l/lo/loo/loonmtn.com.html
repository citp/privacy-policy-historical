<p><strong>Legal Disclaimer </strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web sites. </p>

<p><strong>Log Files</strong></p>
<p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. <br><br>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information. <br><br>We use a third-party tracking service called Google Analytics that uses a small JavaScript string on each web page to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate state of what information is captured, e.g., usage and volume statistics to assist in analyzing our Web site traffic trends and patterns. </p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>Boyne Resorts does not utilize cookies at this time. <br><br><strong>Clear Gifs </strong>(Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</p>
<p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs). Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. <br><br>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these e-mails, please see "Choice and Opt-out." <br><br><strong>Links to Other Sites </strong></p>
<p>Various links across Boyne Resorts' Web sites do contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Boyne Resorts. Please be aware that we, Boyne Resorts, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. <br><br>We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. <br><br>This privacy statement applies only to information collected by Boyne Resorts' Web sites. <br><br><br><strong>Access to Personally Identifiable Information </strong><br><br>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by making the change on our profile update page at www.Boyne.com/Profile or by contacting us by postal mail at the contact information listed below. <br><br><strong>Security </strong></p>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or shopping pages, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, <a>follow this link</a>. <br><br>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. <br><br>If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send e-mail us at <a href="mailto:info@boyneresorts.com">info@boyneresorts.com</a>. <br><br><strong>Business Transitions</strong> </p>
<p>In the event Boyne Resorts goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via e-mail or notice on our corporate Web site BoyneResorts.com of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information. <br><br><strong>Changes in this Privacy Statement </strong></p>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. <br><br>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by e-mail, or by means of a notice on our home page at BoyneResorts.com. <br><br><strong>Contact Us </strong><br>If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at: <br></p>
