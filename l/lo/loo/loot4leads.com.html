                <font style="font-size: 9pt"><b>DISCLAIMER</b><br>
                <br>
                </font><font size="1">Loot4Leads.com.com is not in the business 
                of providing consulting or legal services and we recommend that 
                you speak to a consultant or an attorney before relying on this 
                privacy policy for your own use. While we do not think a privacy 
                policy is a legal document, we feel it is a good idea to have a 
                third-party such as a consultant or an attorney review your 
                policy before you begin to implement it on your site. The 
                privacy policy above should not be construed as the rendering of 
                any business or legal advice.</font></font></p></td>
