**Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act  
** The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974, as amended, provides students access to information about themselves, permits students to challenge such information about themselves, and limits the release of such information about students without the student’s explicit written consent.

**Access to student records  
** A student’s record, with certain exceptions including directory information (see below), will not be released without prior written consent of the student. A student has the right to review and question the content of her/his educational record within a reasonable time (45 days) after making a written request for such a review. If there are any questions as to the accuracy or appropriateness of the record that cannot be resolved informally, an opportunity for a hearing on the matter will be provided.

  * To school officials who have a legitimate educational interest in the records 
  * To certain officials of the U.S. Department of Education, the comptroller general, and state and local educational authorities, in connection with certain state or federally supported education programs 
  * In connection with a student’s request for or receipt of financial aid, as necessary to determine the eligibility, amount or conditions of the financial aid, or to enforce the terms and conditions of the aid
