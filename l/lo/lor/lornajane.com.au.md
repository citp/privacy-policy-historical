We respect your rights to privacy under the _Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)_ ( **Act** ) and we comply with all of the Act’s requirementsin respect of the collection, management and disclosure of your personal information.

 **  
What is your personal information?**

When used in this privacy policy, the term “personal information” has the meaning given to it in the Act.  In general terms, it is any information that can be used to personally identify you.  This may include your name, address, telephone number, email address and profession or occupation.  If the information we collect personally identifies you, or you are reasonably identifiable from it, the information will be considered personal information.

 **  
What personal information do we collect and hold?**

In general, you can browse our website and other Lorna Jane owned digital properties without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.  However, there are a few places where we give you an opportunity to provide us with your personal information, such as completing an online survey.  In other instances we may be required to collect your personal information, such as when you purchase a product from us using a credit card.
