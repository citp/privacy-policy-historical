**WHAT IS PERSONAL DATA?**

“Personal data” means any information or pieces of information that could identify you either directly (e.g. your name) or indirectly (e.g. through pseudonymised data, such as a unique ID number). This means that personal data includes things like email/home addresses, usernames, profile pictures, personal preferences and shopping habits, user generated content, financial information, and health information. It could also include unique numerical identifiers like your computer’s IP address or your mobile device’s MAC address, as well as cookies. 

This Privacy Policy covers all personal data about you that is collected and used by L'Oréal. 

**WHAT PERSONAL DATA DO WE COLLECT FROM YOU AND HOW DO WE USE IT?**

You, the consumer, are our priority. You drive what we do. We love hearing from you, learning about you, and creating and delivering products that you enjoy. We know that many of you love interacting with us and because of this, there are many ways that you might share your personal data with us, and ways that we might collect it. 

**How do we collect or receive your personal data?**

We might collect or receive personal data from you via our websites, forms, apps, devices, L’Oréal products or brand pages on social media or otherwise. Sometimes you give this to us directly (e.g. when you create an account, when you contact us, when you purchase from our websites or stores), sometimes we collect it (e.g. using cookies to understand how you use our websites) or sometimes we receive your personal data from other third parties, including other L’Oréal Group entities. 

In the table below, we explain:

  1.  _In what context is your personal data collected?_ This column explains what activity or scenario you are involved in when we use or collect your personal data. For example, whether you are making a purchase, signing up to a newsletter, or browsing a website.


  2.  _What personal data may we hold about you?_ This column explains what types of personal data we may collect when you take part in a particular activity.


  3.  _How and why we use it?_ This column explains what we do with your personal data, and the purposes for collecting and using it.


  4.  _What is our legal basis for using your personal data?_ Whenever we use your personal data, we will have a legal basis to do this. For example, you have asked us to provide a service, you have given us your consent, or we have a legitimate interest in using your personal data. 



The legal basis for the processing of your personal data can be:

  *  **Your consent** – This applies where you provide your personal data and specifically consent to us using it to provide you with a specific service, for example, so that:
    1.  _you can receive marketing communications from us_. If you later ask us to stop sending you marketing communications, we need to keep some of your personal data on a suppression list so that we can make sure we do not contact you again. This is a legal obligation; and 
    2. _we can store certain cookies on your device_. We may place targeted advertising cookies (these allow us to tailor services we offer, specifically to you), analytical cookies (these measure your interaction with our site so we can make improvements) on your device. 


  * **The performance of a contract** – This applies where you provide us with your personal data in order for us to provide you with a service (e.g. you ask us to create a customer account for you or you wish to purchase a product and we can manage the associated logistics). 


  * **Our legitimate interests** –This applies where you provide us with your personal data and we use it to: **  **
    1.  _improve our products and services_. By providing us with your personal data, we are able to better understand your needs and expectations when it comes to the products and services we offer. This understanding means we can improve our products and services so they match your needs. This might involve performing analytics on how you use our products, services, and websites/apps/devices, or trying out new functions which we think you might like based on what we know about you.
    2.  _better engage with you_. Where you provide us with your personal data, we may use it to encourage you to be more actively engaged with our products and brands and increase your overall brand engagement and awareness. One way we do this is by tailoring the marketing communications we send you so that you receive the information most relevant to you.
    3.  _prevent fraud_. Where you provide us with your personal data, it means we can action any payment you make when you purchase any of our products and/or services, and importantly, check that your payment is free from fraud.
    4.  _secure our tools_ : We may use your personal data to keep our tools (websites/apps/devices) safe and secure. This involves making sure our tools are working properly, and that your personal data is kept secure. 


  * **To comply with a legal obligation** – This is where you provide us with your personal data which we need to keep for our legal reasons (e.g. when you make a purchase we need to keep your transaction information to comply with our tax and financial reporting obligations).


  *  **To protect the vital interests of an individual** – This is where we use your personal data to protect you (or someone else) where there is evidence of danger to your (or someone else’s) health and/or safety. 



The table below sets out which legal basis we rely on when processing your personal data for each context.

When we collect personal data, we will indicate which types of personal data are mandatory via asterisks. Some of the personal data we request from you are either necessary for us to:

  * Perform our contract with you (e.g. to deliver the goods you have purchased on our websites/apps);
  * Provide you with a service you have asked for (e.g. to provide you with a newsletter);
  * Comply with legal requirements (e.g. invoicing).

These may include, for example, data comparison or association, or detecting outlier (unusual) data patterns. This fraud detection process may be completely automated or may involve some human intervention where the final decision is taken by a person.

This means that we may collect personal data about you in the different scenarios mentioned in the table above, and use this data to analyse, evaluate, or predict your personal preferences, interests, behaviour and/or location.

Based on our analysis, we then send or display communications and/or content specifically tailored to your interests and needs.

    * By the partner acting also as a data controller and its privacy policy will govern the processing of your personal data for its purposes. 
  * Where you have agreed to receive marketing and commercial communications from a L’Oréal partner through a dedicated opt-in (for instance, through an app branded by L’Oréal and made available to its partners). Your personal data will be processed by the partner acting as a data controller under its own terms and conditions, and in accordance with its privacy policy.
  * We may publish content created by third parties. Where we do this, the third party may place a cookie on your device if you read this content. Please read the third parties’ Cookie Policy for details on what information they may gather from the cookie, and how it is used.



 _Where we Store your Personal data_

The personal data that we collect from you may be transferred to, accessed in, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our service providers. 

Where L’Oréal transfers personal data outside of the EEA, this will be done in a secure and lawful way. As some countries may not have laws governing the use and transfer of personal data, we will take steps to make sure that third parties adhere to the commitments set out in this Privacy Policy. These steps may include reviewing third parties’ privacy and security standards, and/or entering into appropriate contracts (on the basis of the template adopted by the EU Commission and available via its [homepage](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/index_en.htm)).

For further information, please contact us as per the “Contact” section below. 

_How Long Do We Keep Your Personal data_

We will keep your personal data for as long as we need it to provide you with your requested service(s) or to meet our commercial or legal obligations. 

To determine the retention period of your personal data, we consider several criteria to make sure that we do not keep your personal data for long than is necessary or appropriate. These criteria include:

  * The purpose for which we hold your personal data;
  * Our legal and regulatory obligations in relation to that personal data, for example any financial reporting obligations;
  * Whether our relationship with you is ongoing, for example, you have an active account with one or more of our brands, you continue to receive marketing communications, or you regularly browse or purchase off our websites/apps);
  * Whether you are no longer actively participating or engaging with our brands, for example, you do not open our emails, visit our websites, or share user generated content;
  * Any specific requests from you in relation to the deletion of your personal data; and
  * Our legitimate business interests in relation to managing our own rights, for example the defence of any claims.



When we no longer need to retain your personal data, it will be deleted or be anonymised so that you can no longer be identified from it. 

_Is my Personal data Secure?_

We are committed to keeping your personal data secure, and taking all reasonable precautions to do so. We contractually require that trusted third parties who handle your personal data for us do the same. 

We always do our best to protect your personal data and once we have received your personal data, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. As no transmission of information via the internet is completely secure, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data transmitted to our site although. Any transmission is therefore at your own risk. 

_Links to Third Party Sites and Social Login_

Our websites/apps may, from time to time, contain links to the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and/or affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you share any personal data with these websites.

We may offer you the opportunity to use your social media login when interacting with our websites/apps. If you do so, please be aware that you will be sharing your profile information with us. The personal data that is shared will depend on your social media platform settings. Please visit the relevant social media platform and review its privacy policy to understand how your personal data is shared and used in this context.

 _Social Media and User Generated Content_

Some of our websites and apps allow users to submit their own content. Please remember that any content submitted to our social media platforms can be viewed by the public, and you should be cautious about providing certain personal data e.g. financial information or address details. We are not responsible for any actions taken by other individuals if you post personal data on one of our social media platforms and we recommend that you do not share such information.
