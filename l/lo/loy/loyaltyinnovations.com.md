**COOKIES**

**WHAT ARE COOKIES?**

Cookies are small pieces of information created by a website that is stored in your computer either temporarily for that session only (session cookie) or permanently

on the hard drive (persistent cookie). Cookies provide a way for the website to recognize you and keep track of your preferences. The use of cookies is an industry standard and, as such, you will find that most major websites use them.

Session cookies, also called a transient cookie, is stored in temporary memory and does not collect information from your computer. This type of cookie is tied to your web browser and is typically utilized for website administration, such as keeping your website login (or session) active for a period of time. They will expire if you reach a default time-out limit, if you clear your browser cache, or when you completely close down your web browser.

Persistent cookies are not deleted when you close your browser but are stored on your computer’s hard drive. These types of cookies can be used to track your browsing across different sites in order to show you targeted advertisements when you visit. Other uses of persistent cookies may be stored when that site requires information, such as your preferences, for the next time you visit that site.

Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your web browser to refuse cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, please note that some parts of a website, including this Site, may not function properly if you refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, the website will not be able to keep you logged in.

**OUR USE OF COOKIES**

Travel and Transport utilizes session cookies in order to keep your website login active for a period of time and to track your preferences selected for that session. Additionally, we utilize a persistent cookie in order to track that you have accepted our use of cookies so that we do not prompt you again the next time you visit our Site. Travel and Transport does NOT utilize any cookies to track information about your computer or browsing activity from other websites.

**COLLECTION OF INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13**

Travel and Transport will never knowingly request personal data from anyone under the age of 13 without first requesting consent from a parent or legal guardian. Once parental consent is granted, the child’s personal data is treated much like anyone else’s personal data. Parents or legal guardians can change or revoke the consent choices previously made, and review, edit or request the

deletion of their minor children’s personal data by contacting us as set forth below.

**YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO YOUR PERSONAL DATA**

You may choose what personal data (if any) you wish to provide to us. However, if you choose not to provide certain details, your experience with some or all of our services or products may be affected.

Some data privacy or protection laws may require us to obtain a separate express consent for the processing of your personal data. Your consent may also be implied in some circumstances, as permitted by applicable law, such as when communications are required to fulfill your requests.

To the extent required by applicable law, you have the right to access your personal data and confirm the processing of your personal data. Also, where applicable, you have the right to rectify inaccuracies or errors, erase, restrict the processing, object to processing, withdraw consent to the processing of your personal data (or opt-out where applicable), and where applicable, the right to data portability of your personal data. Travel and Transport will handle those requests in the time specified by applicable law.

Please note that oftentimes Travel and Transport collects personal data under the direction of its customers, including the company you are employed by or are otherwise traveling or attending a meeting on behalf of. Your use of our products and services may be subject to such company’s policies, if any. If such company is administering your use of our products or services, please direct your privacy inquiries to the administrator of such company.
