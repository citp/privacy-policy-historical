Collection of your Personal Information

Loyaltepays collects personal identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, address or telephone number as well as well as the IP address of your computer, browser type and the time and date you access the Loyaltepays webiste. This information is used for the sole purpose of maintaining the integrity of the Loyaltepays referral program and to provide behavioural statistics regarding your use of the tools and resourcs provided by Loyaltepays and our affiliated information publishers. 

Loyaltepays encourages you to review the privacy statements of any website that you link to from our web portal. Loyaltepays is not responsible for the privacy statements or content on other Web sites. 

Use of your Personal Information

Loyaltepays collects and uses your personal information to operate and deliver the services you have requested. Loyaltepays also uses your personal identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from affiliated publishers. We may also contact you to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

**Loyaltepays does not sell, rent or lease its  registered users lists to third parties**. Loyaltepays may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personal identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, Loyaltepays may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Loyaltepays, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

Loyaltepays keeps track of the pages our registered users visit within the Loyaltepays web portal, in order to determine which one of our services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content to portal users whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

Loyaltepays will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on behalf of the Loyaltepays site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Loyaltepays; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of other users of Loyaltepays, or the public.

Use of Cookies

The Loyaltepays Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages on Loyaltepays, a cookie helps Loyaltepays to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, and so on. 

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of our services.

Security of your Personal Information

Loyaltepays secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

Changes to this Statement

Loyaltepays will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. Loyaltepays encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
