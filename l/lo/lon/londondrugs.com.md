## Safeguarding your Personal Information

At London Drugs, we will not collect, use, or disclose your personal information without your consent - except as required or permitted by law. We do not and will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone for any reason.

Personal information you provide to us will only be used by us as part of our ongoing efforts to provide you with superior service and selection.

We know that we earn your business and your trust with each transaction. That is why we will take every step necessary to protect your privacy by safeguarding any personal information we collect, provide to third-party service providers and/or store during the course of doing business together.

Our mandate for protecting your privacy is to ensure that our privacy standards meet or exceed the guiding principles established in federal and provincial privacy legislation.

London Drugs is responsible for personal information it holds or which is under its control, including the personal information it entrusts to service providers. We have designated a person to act as our Privacy Officer, whose duties will include monitoring London Drugs compliance with relevant legislation, replying to our valued customers’ questions, as well as responding to requests by individuals for access to and correction for any personal information London Drugs has collected on them.
