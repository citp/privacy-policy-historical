# Lonex Privacy policy

**LONEX PRIVACY POLICY**

**PRIVACY OF YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS**   
We use encrypted SSL connection to process your credit card information and DO NOT store any of your payment details in our system. The payments are carried out in the background by the PayPal payment processing gateway and go through the HSBC bank's terminal. Working with the two leaders in online payment operations, we guarantee fast and secure processing of your payment. Not only do we NOT make a record of your credit card details in our system, but also - for maximum online security - we do NOT share this information with any third party. 

**PRIVACY OF YOUR ACCOUNT**   
We consider your registration data and the content of all your messages private and confidential. The header of the messages that you send will contain your name (e-mail address) and Internet Protocol (IP) address. We will not intentionally monitor or disclose any of your e-mail content or registration data unless we are required to do so: 

  * to enforce these Terms and Conditions, 

  * by law, 

  * to defend ourselves in any legal action, 

  * to protect our property. 




Since your password is essential for protecting your privacy, we encourage you to NOT share it with anyone and change it frequently. Additionally, you agree to respect the privacy and confidentiality of others. 

**PRIVACY OF YOUR REGISTRATION DATA**   
Lonex collects certain information during the registration process. The personally identifiable information that Lonex collects includes first and last name. Lonex also collects non-personally identifiable information, such as country, age, gender, etc. You may update your Registration Information at any time from your Web Hosting Control Panel - > My Account - > Change Login Credentials section. 

We may disclose aggregate registration statistics in connection with our marketing activities.

**WHY WE NEED THIS INFORMATION**   
Your registration information is needed in order for us to operate the site, to provide support for your account, for statistical purposes, etc. Lonex will NOT send you any unsolicited information, including e-mails, except as mentioned hereby.

New customers will receive a Lonex welcome e-mail containing information about the features provided by the Service, as well as WHCP (Web Hosting Control Panel) and FTP login details. Lonex may also send system notifications upon need, related to any upgrade, maintenance or other service issues concerning your hosting account.
