                PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITES OR SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND TO ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY.<br>
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE EXIT THIS PAGE AND DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITES OR SERVICES.</p>
                <p><strong>Our Commitment to Privacy</strong> </p>
                <p>We understand and respect the privacy concerns of our users. Therefore, we have made it a critical focus to protect the confidentiality and security of the personal information you provide us. <br>
This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices of lonelycheatingwives.com and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our” ) and governs the use of the website, or other Company products and services (collectively, the “Services”)by users of the Services (“you” or “your” ).We have created this Privacy Policy to inform you about what information we collect, how we use and share your information, and our privacy practices.
</p>
                <p><strong>The Information We Collect</strong> </p>
                <p>In order for our services to work and work economically, we need to obtain certain information from our users. We may collect two types of information: Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII).<br>
                PII is information that identifies a specific user of the Services and is provided by the user. When you engage in certain activities on the Services, such as when you register to use the Services, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself that we will collect and store. Depending on what activity you are engaged in, some of the information that we request will be identified as mandatory or as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular activity, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity.<br> 
We may also collect demographic data for certain Services, which helps tailor the Services to display content that we think would provide the greatest benefit to the user.  You do not have to engage in the activities in which we ask you to provide such information. But if you choose to do so, we may ask you to provide information, such as your first and last name, gender, email address or date of birth.<br> 
Our applications do not enable GPS location automatically, however, if you access the Services via a mobile device, then the PII may also include user location information if your device provides GPS/location services and you turn those features on to benefit from our applications functionalities. This information may reveal your actual location, including GPS data.
Non-PII is information that identifies your computer and its navigational patterns through the Services (but not a specific user). We may automatically collect Non-PII information when you visit the Services, through the use of a variety of tools including cookies (small text files that are stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes and which contain information about that user’s computer), or other available data analysis or collection technologies.
</p>
                <p><strong>How We Use and Share Information</strong></p>
                <p>We use the information we collect to (a) provide, maintain, and protect the Services; (b) notify you of promotions, special events, new services and special offers, for example, through e-mails; (c) tailor our product offerings, customer service and overall experience; (d) improve the content, operation, appearance and utility of the Services; (e) conduct surveys, research and evaluations; (f) troubleshoot and resolve disputes; (g) gather demographic data and (h) accomplish other administrative tasks.<br>

Such business partners include companies who provide business services to us or on our behalf, such as to market products or services to you, monitor Services activity, serve Services content, help to maintain our customer database, administer e-mails, surveys or other contests, and fulfill orders [if applicable].<br>
We also reserve the right to disclose your information in good faith as required by law, in response to legal process including law enforcement requests, and with any person or entity that may acquire all or any part of our business or assets, in connection with any change in control of us, and where needed to prevent fraud and to protect the safety, property, or legal rights of users of the Services or our affiliates.</p>
