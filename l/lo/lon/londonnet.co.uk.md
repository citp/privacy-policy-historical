As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files.

**Cookies and Web Beacons**  
We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums.

We also use third party advertisements on LondonNet.co.uk to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geo-targeting purposes (showing London real estate ads to someone in London, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on this site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our sites and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad](http://www.google.co.uk/privacy_ads.html) and content network privacy policy.

If, like LondonNet, you use Windows PCs we recommend a regular 'clean-up' of your cookies and 'temporary internet files'. Aside from the privacy issues discussed above, cleaning or clearing up these files will often help to speed up your PC. We use a neat, free package called [CCLeaner](http://www.piriform.com/CCLEANER) every week or two on our machines. Yes, it means we have to re-enter a few passwords, etc but we like our PCs to hum along with a spring in their step.
