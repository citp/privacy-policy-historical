#### **14\. WEBSITE SECURITY**

The security of your personal details is our utmost concern - that is why we have taken a number of measures to ensure your details are protected.

We use the most up to date security system and our site is regularly scanned for vulnerabilities by a third party to ensure it remains secure.

We don't keep your details online, our website uses a SSL encrypted secure internet connection to protect your personal and payment details. 

This means all the details you supply and any responses are encrypted before they are sent over the internet.

If you are still not confident shopping via the internet, please call on the phone number provided under “IDENTITY AND CONTACT DETAILS OF THE CONTROLLER“.

#### **15\. UPDATE OF THE PRIVACY POLICY**

We may update this privacy policy from time to time, for example when we adapt our website or legal requirements change.
