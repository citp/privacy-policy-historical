# London Fog Privacy Policy: London Fog Official Online Store | Coats, Jackets and Accessories

LondonFog.com respects the privacy of our customers and the users of our website and has instituted the policies and practices described below to ensure that your personal information is handled appropriately. Our online privacy policy describes the types of personal information we may collect from you when you visit our website and when we share it with third parties. The information on this website and our privacy policy are subject to change from time to time. Any material changes to our privacy policy and practices will be reflected on this page so that you can be aware of what information we collect and how we are using and/or disclosing it. By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of this information by London Fog.com.

### What information does LondonFog.com collect?

LondonFog.com collects data that you provide on LondonFog.com, email registration, sweepstakes, contests, or online membership; or through phone, mail and fax interactions or paper registrations that you submit.

LondonFog.com may collect and store two types of information: "personal information" and "automatic information."

Personal information tells us who you are such as your name, gender, billing address, shipping address, email address, telephone number, date of birth or age, any personal preferences you choose to provide, transaction details such as style, size, price, discount, date, your credit card number and expiration date used for transactions, and an assigned password to protect your privacy.

Automatic information is information that we collect automatically whenever you interact with this website such as your IP address, the type of computer you use, and the web browser you use. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet. Each time you visit this site, our web server may automatically recognize and collect this information. Automatic information also includes "cookies" and "web beacons". A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Among other things, cookies provide a means for us to keep track of your online patterns and preferences. By understanding which areas of the site you visit, cookies allow us to present information, products and services that are of personal interest. A cookie will not allow us to learn any personal information (such as your real name and address) that you have not otherwise disclosed. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can change your browser so that it will not automatically accept cookies. However, if you do so, it is possible that some portions of the site may not function as intended. "Web beacons", also known as clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs, are small image files that we may place on web pages and within web-based email newsletters that we send. Working in conjunction with cookies, web beacons allow us to accurately count the number of unique users who have visited a specific page and the number of times those pages are displayed. We can also use web beacons to let us know how many people opened a web-based email newsletter.

We may associate automatic information with your personal information. In the event of such association, such automatic information will be considered personal information.  


### How does LondonFog.com use this information?

LondonFog.com uses this information to confirm and process sales transactions or to contact you with questions or communications about your order, or to respond to your customer service inquiries.

LondonFog.com also uses this information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience, both online and in our stores, to communicate with you for marketing and promotional purposes including via targeted postal pieces, phone messages, or personalized emails, and to improve the effectiveness of our websites and business activities. You may indicate your contact preferences regarding promotional communications either directly to us online or to customer service representatives. 

### How does LondonFog.com protect your information?

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be unconditionally guaranteed to be secure. Therefore any information you transmit to us is sent at your own risk.

However, when you place an order online, we use encryption technology, such as Secure Socket Layer Technology ("SSL"), to protect your personal information during data transport. SSL encrypts your order information, including your name, address, and credit card number, before it is transmitted to us to avoid the decoding of your information by anyone other than LondonFog.com.

In addition, when you create an online account on LondonFog.com, you must select a personal password. As a member of LondonFog.com website, you will be able to view, among other things, your account profile, contact preferences, order history, address book. We store this type of information so that you do not have to reenter it each time you make a purchase or visit the website. Should you decide to become a member of LondonFog.com’s website, you will be asked to provide an accurate email address and create a password. In order to help protect your personal information, you should be careful about maintaining the secrecy of your password.

### Does LondonFog.com disclose your information to others?

Except as described in this privacy policy, LondonFog.com does not sell, rent or trade with third parties any personal information you provide to us online or at our stores, nor do we share such information with third parties. We may disclose personal information about you to third parties who provide services to us and who agree to maintain the confidentiality of such information in accordance with this privacy policy and use the information only in connection with the services they provide. These third parties may provide a variety of services to us including, without limitation, assisting us in fulfilling your transactions and customer service inquiries, updating your customer information record in our database, deploying our promotional offers to you, or fulfilling your request to unsubscribe from our email. We do not authorize those third parties to make any other use of your information.

We may use and/or disclose to others information about your demographics and use of our website in a manner that does not reveal your identity.

We may disclose personal information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may have breached our [ Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms.asp) or who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other users of our website, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.

We may also disclose personal information when we reasonably believe that the law requires it. We might sell or buy subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, personally identifiable information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy policy. Also, in the unlikely event that assets of Anne Klein are sold, personal information may be one of the transferred assets.

### Can I unsubscribe?

Yes. LondonFog.com honors requests to unsubscribe from receipt of emails, not only for promotional emails that LondonFog.com sends, but also for emails about LondonFog.com that we permit other companies to send to their own list of subscribers. 

### Does LondonFog.com have links to other web sites?

While you are using this website, you may be linked or directed to other third party sites outside of the website that are beyond our control. Each of these third parties may have a privacy policy different from ours. For example, you might click on a link or banner ad that will take you off the website.
