Whenever we ask you for information about yourself, if you have indicated that you wish to receive direct marketing material from us and/or from third parties, your personal details will be included in a database compiled for direct marketing purposes and from time to time, you may receive these marketing communications.

If you have indicated that you wish to receive direct marketing material or e-mail updates from us, and/or from third parties but subsequently change your mind, you should notify us at privacy@londoneye.com. As soon after this as is reasonably practicable, we will remove your name from the relevant database.
