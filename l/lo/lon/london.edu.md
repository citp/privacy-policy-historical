###  What information do we collect? 

Our sites and services contain online forms that you can use to enquire about or apply for programmes, register for events, download brochures, and donate and pay online via SecureTrading. 

To do this, our sites and services collect a range of information. Much of this is **automatic and anonymous**. 

We will only collect personally identifiable information when we have **your specific consent** to do so. All personal data will be managed in accordance with our obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998. 

###  Cookies 

**What is a cookie?  
** A cookie is a small piece of text information that is sent by an organisation to your computer and stored on the hard drive. **Cookies allow the organisation to recognise you**. 

There are two types of cookie: 

  * **session cookies** last until you leave the site 
  * **persistent cookies** remain on your computer for much longer (how long depends on the specific cookie). 



**Why does London Business School use cookies?**  
We use **Google Analytics** cookies and **WebTrends** cookies to help us analyse how our website is working and make it better. 

We use **login cookies** so that when you log in to restricted areas we can remember your details next time you visit.

###  What do we do with the information we collect?

**Personal information** is used to give you the information or service you've asked for. We may also tell you about similar products and services provided by the School. 

###  How do we keep information secure? 

We're committed to protecting your data from: 

  * unauthorised access

To do this we have a number of solutions and procedures in place. These are reviewed periodically to make sure they are still effective and meet current best practice.

We don't rent, lease or sell your personal information to third parties. 

There may, however, be times when we share data with third parties to perform specific services. These third parties are not allowed to use your personal information except to provide these services. They are also required to keep your data confidential. 

We may also need to disclose your information if required to do so by law.
