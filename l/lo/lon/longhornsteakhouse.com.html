                        the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A "web

                        while browsing a website. As the visitor clicks through the website, a record of
                        the action may be collected and stored. We may link certain data elements we have

                        information we have obtained about you to let us know, for example, whether you
                        have opened an e-mail we sent to you. Your browser may tell you how to be notified
                        when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain
                        types of cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able

                    providing you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual

                        You may see certain ads on other websites based on your visits to our Sites because
                        we participate in advertising networks administered by third-party vendors. Ad networks
                        allow us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and
                        contextual means. These networks track your online activities over time by collecting

                        logs and web beacons. The networks use this information to show you advertisements
                        that are tailored to your individual interests. The information our ad network vendors
                        collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the
                        vendors' advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and
                        the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on these
                        Sites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. This process
