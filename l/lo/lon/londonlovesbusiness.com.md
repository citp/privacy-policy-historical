We treat the handling of personal data seriously. The Privacy Policy below details how data collected about you by Us and/or advertisers is used. We assure you that We will only use your data as specified herein and for Our legitimate business reasons.

1\. Unless otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy or Our User Terms, We will not sell, rent or trade your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes without your express written consent.

We may disclose your data to certain permitted third parties, such as third party service providers, Our own professional advisers who are bound by confidentiality codes and when We are legally obliged to disclose your data. We may disclose your personal data to advertisers who have signed up to the Website where you have given your permission for Us to do so (including the contents of your CV, if you have registered with Us and uploaded this on to the website), or you have contacted the advertiser through sending communications through the Website. We may also process data collected about you relating to details of your use of the website and communications with third parties through the website, to assess compliance with the User Terms.

2\. For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”), We are the data controller, unless otherwise confirmed in writing to you at the time your data is collected by Us.

ii. Via your individual IP location. This is a function of the website that enables Us to assess session information relating to the use of the website, such as the duration of the visit and the type of browser used. Such information is only used for Us to evaluate use of the website, as well as for Us to diagnose problems with its server and to administer the website.  
iii. Through ‘Cookies’ when certain search functions of the website are used so that we can return results of searches carried out to you.

5\. In order to forward your details to relevant third parties (e.g. Our client advertisers) as requested by you, we require your consent to do so, which you provide to us when you request us to forward such information to those third parties.
