# Privacy policy - External Programme website - University of London

The External Programme recognises that data protection and privacy are an important issue, particularly with regard to the World Wide Web; consequently we take your personal privacy very seriously. The Privacy Policy explains what information is collected when you access our website and how the information might be used. We adhere to the principle of data protection and privacy and endeavour to implement it within the guidance of current UK legislation.

##  Accessing the External Programme's website

As a general rule the website employs the notion of 'public access' and does not require you to login. Consequently, when you access the website you are not required to submit any personal information; however, in common with most web servers, certain anonymous data is gathered. For each visitor, our web server collects Usage Data* which is analysed and presented in statistical form; the type of information obtained includes: the number of page requests per week, domain names (e.g. .com, .ac.uk, .net), referring sites (e.g. Google.com, Yahoo.com), Browser summaries (e.g. the number of visitors using Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape) and Operating System reports (e.g. the number of page requests made using Windows NT, Windows 98, Macintosh or Unix). 

On occasion summary statistics may be disclosed to third parties, however, it is important to understand that the data doesn't provide any personal information (e.g. email addresses) and cannot be attributed to individuals. The primary purpose for collecting the information, which is used on an aggregate basis, is to improve the content and functionality of the website.

***Note:** This data is protected from public access and can only be viewed and disclosed by authorized personnel. 

## Cookies

Cookies are small data structures used by a website to 'request' information from a client (user), return the information to the web site and then store the information; cookies can be used to obtain personal information e.g. email addresses. There are very few instances where the External Programme's website requires the use of Cookies. 

##  Web Forms

Where 'Web Forms' appear on the site user's might be prompted to supply personal details (e.g. name and address); for example, if you want to obtain a hard copy of a prospectus we need to know where to send it. Within this context all online forms should contain an explanation about how the information you supply will be used, e.g. "Please note: Data Protection Act: The personal information received through this facility will only be used for the dispatch of prospectuses." Similarly, any paper forms that you complete and return to the University should be held and processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act.

## Student-to-Student Network(s)

In certain instances the External Programme's website facilitates communication between students (and staff) via online networks. Through these facilities personal information (e.g. an email address) might be made available to other students (and staff). Within this context it should be made clear that the networks operate on an 'opt-in' basis, i.e. you have to request that your details are added to the network and consent to their inclusion. It should be noted, however, that staff at The University of London External Programme don't generally monitor such services, and consequently, The External Programme doesn't accept responsibility for any information or other material transmitted using a particular service. Similarly, The views expressed by students using these networks (or similar) do not reflect the views of The University of London External Programme.

##  Third Party Links and information

The External Programme's website has links to third party websites and information. While links and information are only added if they are perceived to be of use to our website users The University of London External Programme does not accept responsibility for their content. Moreover, The University of London External Programme cannot be held responsible for any information submitted to the third party sites and any subsequent use of the information
