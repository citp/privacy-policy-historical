          Longwood University Internet Privacy Statement </h3>
        <p>Thank you for visiting one of Longwood University's websites. We are committed 
          to providing the latest technologies and online services to both our 
          visitors and members of the Longwood community. We are also committed 
          to privacy issues, and we would like to take this opportunity to tell 
          you about what information we collect, how we use this information and 
          your rights concerning this information. </p>
        <p>Nearly all of our websites may be visited without revealing any personal 
          information about yourself. However, there are several pieces of information 
          that we collect from you each time you access our websites. We log your 
          computer's IP address, the URL that referred you to our site, the pages 
          you access at our sites and the type and version of both your operating 
          system and web browser. We also track any terms and phrases that you 
          enter into our search engine service. None of this information is ever 
          used to personally identify you or any other user, but rather it is 
          used to generate reports of site usage. These reports help us to identify 
          what parts of the site are most popular, what search engines visitors 
          are using to find our websites and what things visitors are having trouble 
          finding. These reports help us determine overall website usage, identify 
          problem areas and ultimately provide better services for visitors like 
          yourself. </p>
        <p>Certain services provided by our websites may utilize "cookies". A 
          <i>cookie</i> is a small piece of data that is sent to your web browser 
          from one of our websites and stored on your computer's hard disk. A 
          <i>cookie</i> can not read any data off your hard disk, read <i>cookie</i> 
          files created by other websites or perform any other action against 
          your computer. When <i>cookies</i> are used, we will provide you with 
          an explanation of why the <i>cooki</i>e is being set and what information 
          the <i>cookie</i> will contain. You can configure your web browser to 
          allow or disallow <i>cookies</i> by changing your browser's options 
          or preferences, but disabling <i>cookies</i> may prevent some areas 
          of our websites from working properly. </p>
        <p>Occasionally there will be a service provided by our website that will 
          require you to provide personal information. A perfect example is our 
          Online Admissions Application, which you obviously could not complete 
          without providing some personal information. When personal information 
          is requested it will always be preceded by an explanation of why you 
          are being asked to provide this information. The explanation will also 
          include information about who will have access to the data and there 
          will also be an explanation for the procedure for correcting and/or 
          viewing the data that we have collected about you. If you choose not 
          to provide personal information through our website, you may be unable 
          to utilize some of the features we offer to our online visitors. When 
          it is possible, we will attempt to provide you with an alternative method 
          for the same service.</p>
        <p> The Longwood University websites contain a variety of links to other 
          web sites not hosted by us. Longwood University is not responsible for 
          the privacy practices or the content of any such website. Content and 
          views presented by these sites may not reflect the views of Longwood 
          College. It is your responsibility to check with other websites to determine 
          their privacy policies. Also remember that any time you voluntarily 
          disclose information in an unencrypted online forum, such as e-mail, 
          web forms or chat rooms, that information can be collected and used 
          by others. It is ultimately your responsibility to protect your personal 
          information while you are online. </p>
        <p>By using our websites, you consent to the collection and use of information 
          by the Longwood University websites as specified above. If we decide to 
          change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so 
          that you are always aware of our policies concerning information collection.
