</p>

</p>
<h2>Visitor Identification - Usage of "Cookies"</h2>

<p>From time to time, information may be placed on your computer to improve this site and our services for you. This information is commonly referred to as a "cookie", which many web sites use. Cookies are pieces of data stored on your computer's hard drive or browser, and not on this site. They typically enable collection of certain information about your computer, including your internet protocol address, your computer's operating system, your browser type and the address of any referring sites. 
</p>
<p>The use of cookies provides benefits to you, such as eliminating the need for you to enter your password frequently during a session, or, where applicable, re-enter items you place in a shopping cart from visit to visit if you do not finish a transaction on an earlier visit. By showing how and when our visitors use this site or other our sites, the use of cookies allows us to continue to improve the sites. If you do not wish to receive cookies, or want to be notified of when they are placed, you may set your web browser to do so, if your browser so permits. Please understand that if cookies are turned off, you may not be able to view certain parts of this site that may enhance your visit. Some of our business partners whose content is linked to or from this site may also use cookies. How-ever, we have no access to or control over these cookies. This site also makes use of cookies for website traffic analysis and anonymous demographic profiling.
</p>
<h2>Security</h2>

<p>We have endeavored to take commercially reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized access to and improper use of your personal data submitted to us via your use of this site. For example, we use encryption technology when collecting financial personal data such as credit card information. If this site supports on-line transactions, it will use an industry standard security measure, such as the one available through "Secure Sockets Layer" ("SSL"), to protect the confidentiality and security of online transactions. If used, industry standard security measures like SSL authentication ensure that credit card information, as well as other personal data submitted as part of the buying process, is reasonably safe from third party interception. 
</p>
<p>While there are always risks associated with providing personal data, whether in person, by phone or via the internet or other technologies, and no system of technology is completely safe or "tamper"/"hacker" proof, we have endeavored to take reasonable precautions which are appropriate to the nature of the information to prevent and minimize such risks in connection with your use of this site. 
</p>
<h2>Accuracy of Collected Data</h2>

<p>We will on our own initiative, or at your request, free of charge, replenish, rectify or erase any incomplete, inaccurate or outdated personal data retained by us in connection with the operation of this site. Please consult the contact information posted below on this page, if any, or elsewhere on this site to determine how best to con-tact us to update and/or review your personal data and/or opt out of receiving marketing communications from us. 
</p>
