Cookies can have many uses, such as to target advertising, as well as to enable website functionality and for security.

Persistent cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable cookies, some areas of our website may not work properly.

Information is transmitted from your browser and may include an identifier assigned by the social network or third party, information about your browser type, operating system, device type, IP address, and the URL of the web page where widget appears.

We limit the collection of Personal Data to that which is required in order to fulfill our contractual obligations and provide services to you.

##### How long is personal data stored?

The Personal Data we collect as described above that is necessary for the performance of a contract is stored for as long as the University is obligated to offer agreed upon services.

Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Statement, we do not sell, rent, or share your Personal Data with third parties. We may disclose your Personal Data to:

  * departments within the University;
  * third parties involved in assisting the University in providing services, including but not limited to employee background checks, administrative services, and technical services;
  * local, state and/or Federal agencies, pursuant to valid legal process; and
  * other parties as we deem reasonably necessary in order to protect and defend our rights, or the rights or safety of third parties



### How Personal Data is Shared Within Widener

We use your Personal Data primarily to enable delivery, personalization, and improvement of services at Widener. Personal Data may be shared with other departments and business units at the University to the extent necessary to deliver and improve services offered or to satisfy local, state and federal laws and regulations.

### How Personal Information Data is Shared Outside Widener

We may share your Personal Data with others outside of the University, such as third-party providers, vendors, and others acting on behalf of the University, for a variety of purposes, for example, to the extent necessary to deliver, improve, and tailor services to you. Third parties who receive Personal Data are generally contractually prohibited from using or sharing Personal Data for any purpose other than providing services to users. We ensure that third parties comply with all applicable laws and regulations. Widener does not sell Personal Data to third-party data brokers. The University may share Personal Data pursuant to valid legal processes, to detect, prevent or investigate fraud or system or network security issues, or to protect the safety or rights of the university and other third parties.

### Sharing Cookies and Digital Personal Data with Third Parties

The University has relationships with authorized third-party providers whose services are accessed through the my.Widener.edu portal or other web services. In order to facilitate your access to these services, the University may automatically send one or more of your cookies to the third-party site or service so that you may access third-party services without re-entering your Widener user ID and password, or other required information, each time.

We use the information we get from web analytics tools such as Google Analytics to improve the user experience or our website. These tools collect data such as browser information, operating system, and page views through the implementation of session cookies or persistent cookies. Each tool creates a persistent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user. The cookie is only used by Widener University and/or the software publisher of the respective tool. The software publisher’s ability to use and share information collected about your visits to Widener University websites is restricted by each software publisher’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policies.

### Digital Marketing and Ad Networks

We may sometimes use "interest-based" advertisements also known as "online behavioral advertising." Online behavioral advertising is advertising that is directed to you based, at least in part, on your Internet browsing behavior across websites and over time. Although we do not share Personal Data with the third parties that conduct interest-based advertising operations on our behalf, these third parties and their affiliates do collect certain information as a result of their javascript "tags" and other technologies being used on our website. The information that they collect includes the names of web pages you view (URL's), unique identifiers, your IP address, timestamp, and certain types of digital Personal Data. A longer list of some of the technologies used for advertising and other purposes on our website and in our mobile apps are listed under the "Technologies Used" section.

##### Third Parties May Collect Personal Data from Other Sources

Some third parties involved in advertising operations may maintain their own proprietary consumer databases that allow them to personally identify or track website visitors. Other third parties have proprietary technologies to determine what additional devices you may use, on which it can display relevant advertisements.

##### Do-Not-Track

Do-Not-Track is a public-private initiative that has developed a “flag” or signal that an Internet user may activate in the user’s browser software to notify websites that the user does not wish to be “tracked” by third-parties as defined by the initiative. The online community has not agreed on what actions, if any, should be taken by the websites that receive the “do not track” signal, and therefore Do-Not-Track is not yet standardized. Our website does not alter its behavior or change its services when it receives a “do-not-track” flag or signal from your browser.

##### Your Privacy and Ad Choices

You can make decisions about your privacy and the ads you receive. You can control whether companies serve you on-line behavioral advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance website and using its opt-out feature, located at: <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>. The DAA opt-out requires that cookies not be blocked in your browser.

As an alternative to the DAA opt–out, you can also elect to block browser cookies from first parties (such as those from our website) and browser cookies from third parties (such as advertisers) by using the cookie blocking options built into your browser software. If you block browser cookies, some parts of our website may not function correctly. Also, blocking cookies will not stop third-parties from collecting IP address, data stored in "Flash" cookies, and certain other types of technical information that may uniquely identify your browser.

### EMAIL

##### Email Messages

If you send us email, we may share your email address and message content with others inside the University, and with persons and organizations outside the University, to the extent it is necessary to process and/or address your inquiry, or serve your needs. Email addresses and message content may also be shared inside the University as deemed necessary by the University for disciplinary investigation. The University may also share your email address and message content with others outside the University to the extent necessary to comply with legal investigations and/or to protect the University’s rights and interests.

##### Forwarding Email: Students’ Private Email Address

If you forward email from your University-assigned email address to a private (non-Widener University) email address, we may send email to either or both addresses. We may also share your private email address with service providers inside and outside the University.

##### Faculty and Staff University-Assigned Email Addresses

Faculty and staff University-assigned email addresses appear in the Widener email directory, and are visible to all students, faculty, staff, administrators and others who have authorized access to the directory. We may share faculty and staff University-assigned email address with service providers inside and outside the University and do so according to university policies. Faculty and staff must comply with university policies and ensure that all business transactions are conducted solely through university approved systems.

### Telephone Numbers

If you provide your telephone number(s), we may share these numbers with service providers inside and outside the University. The University may share telephone numbers with outside persons or organizations to comply with legal investigations and/or to protect the University’s rights and interests.
