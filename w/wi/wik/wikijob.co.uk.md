## Information we store and use

When you register with us or order from us, we ask for personal information such as your name, e-mail address, employer details, contact telephone number and so on. All this is necessary to verify your identity and eligibility for the services provided by WikiJob. You may also be asked for additional information if you sign up to receive news updates or other information services or to enter into competitions.

All our website financial transactions are handled through our payment services provider, PayPal.  You can review the PayPal privacy policy at [www.paypal.com](http://www.paypal.com/ "www.paypal.com").  We will share information with PayPal only to the extent necessary for the purposes of processing payments you make via our website and dealing with complaints and queries relating to such payments.

We do not store your financial information.

## Information safety and security

We also operate security procedures as required under UK data protection legislation (the Data Protection Act 1998) to protect the information that we store about you from unauthorised access.

## Internal confidentiality

WikiJob aims to protect your privacy in the following ways:

  * Access to account information is limited to those who need access for the performance of their job.
  * We use full login and password controls on our data access systems.
  * All full and part-time employees are required to sign a confidentiality clause as part of their terms of employment.
  * Confidentiality and database access controls are reviewed periodically and updated as required to further protect your personal data.
