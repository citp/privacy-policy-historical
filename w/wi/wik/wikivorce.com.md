# Data Privacy Policy | UK Divorce Support Community

#### What information do we collect and why?

You can access the Wikivorce website and browse certain areas without disclosing any personal information about yourself. 

Registering on our site is optional. If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still use the majority of the website. 

When you register you will be asked to submit personal information about yourself (e.g. name and email address etc.). 

By entering your details in the fields requested, you enable us to provide you with the services you select. Whenever you provide such personal information, we will treat that information in accordance with this policy. 

You can unregister or unsubscribe from email communications at any time by sending an email with 'unregister' or 'unsubscibe' in the title to [customersupport@wikivorce.com](mailto:customersupport@wikivorce.com). 

#### How do we protect your personal details?

We have procedures governing the storage and disclosure of personal details to prevent unauthorised access and misuse. In addition, your personal information is password-protected: only you and Wikivorce have access to your personal information. 

For clarity the personal information which is password protected and covered by this privacy policy includes:  
\- your email address  
\- your name  
\- your private messages/emails 

However, please be aware that other (possibly personal) information that you voluntarily choose to publish on the site will be viewable by guests and members. This includes information that you submit through:  
\- the forum  
\- your blog  
\- in the chatroom  
\- in a comment

Wikivorce will not accept any liability for the consequences of this information that you chose to publish being accessed and used by a third party. 

#### Access to your personal information

You have the right to request a copy of the personal information Wikivorce holds about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected. (Please note that we charge £5 for information requests.) Please address requests via email to [customersupport@wikivorce.com](mailto:customersupport@wikivorce.com). However, you may find it easier to just login and view your profile on the website where you can view and update all your personal information. 

#### How do we use your personal information?

Wikivorce may disclose and use personal information collected about you within its own organisation for the purpose of internal business administration and analysis. 

We will not rent, trade or sell your data to others. 

If you have opted to receive Wikivorce communications, we will use your personal information to send these newsletters to you. 

If you have requested to be kept informed of services that we offer, we will contact you with these details. 

You may receive emails to notify you that you have a message in your Wikivorce inbox, or to let you know that someone has replied to your forum posting. 

We will respect your email privacy. You will not receive unsolicited mail from Wikivorce and/or from third parties. We will, however, mail you occasionally with information about important changes to our service. 

We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage in order to help us develop the design and layout of the website. 

For these purposes we may transfer, store and process your personal information internationally, including to/in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Other countries offer differing levels of protection for personal information, not all of which will be as high as the levels of protection offered in the UK. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
