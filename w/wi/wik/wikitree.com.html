<h1>Privacy on WikiTree</h1>

<p>We spend a great deal of time working on privacy issues. We try to do everything we can to protect your privacy while still enabling online collaboration. But the bottom line is that we are just a host. You use WikiTree at your own risk. You are responsible for the information you share about yourself and other people.</p>

<p>Please read and understand the following Privacy Policy (<em>last revised on December 13, 2013</em>). Use of WikiTree is governed by this and our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Service</a>.</p>


<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy is provided by Interesting.com, Inc. ("we" or "us") to describe the collection and use of information on WikiTree.com ("WikiTree", "Website", or "services") so that users ("you," "your," or "user") can make informed decisions. Section headings and bold text are included for convenience only.</p>


<h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

<p>We invite you to share information if you choose to use WikiTree — such as your name and e-mail address — that is considered "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information">Personally Identifiable Information</a>". You may, of course, decline to submit Personally Identifiable Information to the Website, in which case you may not be able to register or WikiTree may not be able to provide certain services to you.</p>

<p>If you submit Personally Identifiable Information through the Website, people you allow in your Trusted List will have access to this information. You can control which people can access your information through your Trusted List but those people could forward this information to other users or non-users. There are also other risks, including those described below. <b>Do not post especially sensitive information on WikiTree.</b></p>


<h3>Other Personal Information</h3>

<p>In addition to your name and e-mail address we invite you to submit information that is not generally classified as Personally Identifiable Information but which you may consider personal or private, such as your family history, country, state, or city of residence, gender, age, names of schools attended, etc.</p>

<p>You can control access to most of these details through your Trusted List. However, some of it will be made public so that relatives can find you. Public information may include the following: preferred name, primary photograph, decade of birth (not the exact date), state and country of residence (not the city or the street, which is never solicited), state and country of death (not the city), marital status (not the name of spouse), number of children (not their names), and number of siblings (not their names).</p>

<p>You may update or remove any of your information on the Website at any time. You may request that we remove information by contacting us, with the understanding that we may maintain an archive or back-up of the information not on the Website.</p>



<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>

<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important and is mandated by United States law. Therefore, we do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information on the Website from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our Website is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then you must not use or access the Website at any time or in any manner or provide any information to the Website.</p>

<h3>For International Users</h3>

<p>The Website and services are void where prohibited. If you are accessing the Website from outside the United States, your use of the Website is governed by US law, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.</p>

<h3>Passwords</h3>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>Cookies are small bits of text that are stored on users' hard drives. WikiTree uses both "session ID cookies" and "persistent cookies." Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the site and expire when the user closes their browser. Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the site easier for returning users by remembering a user's login information. Persistent cookies stay on a user's hard drive from one session to the next. You may choose not to receive cookies by following instructions in your web browser's "help" file, but this may make certain aspects of WikiTree more difficult to use.</p>


<h3>Server Logs</h3>

<p>We collect standard technical information in our log files, including date and time of access, IP address, browser type, number of clicks, domain name of referring website, pages viewed, etc. We gather and analyze these statistics to help improve our services. We may share this data in a non-personally identifiable manner with third parties.</p>


<h3>Data Security</h3>

<p>We have implemented commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, or alteration. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk.</p>



<h3>Compromise of Personal Information</h3>

<p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly provide notifications to Users via e-mail notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our Website page, as determined by WikiTree in its sole discretion. WikiTree reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>



<h3>When We Share Information</h3>

<p>We may release your information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state or federal laws or to respond to a court order, subpoena, law enforcement or regulatory request, or search warrant. We reserve the right to collect and share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; as appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service or investigate potential or actual violations of the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy; take precautions against liability; to protect the security or integrity of our Website; to exercise or protect the rights, property, or the rights and personal safety of  affiliates, Users or others; or for other legitimate purposes.</p>

<p>We may provide information, including personal information, to affiliated companies or subcontractors. When we do this, the recipients of your information are bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. We may also assign or transfer the information we collect to a third party in the event that WikiTree is acquired by or merged with a third party entity or of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or similar situation.</p>
