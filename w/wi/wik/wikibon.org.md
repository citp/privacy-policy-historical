##  Summary

If you only read the Wikibon project websites, no more information is collected than is typically collected in server logs by web sites in general. 

If you contribute to the Wikibon projects, you are **publishing** every word you post publicly. If you write something, assume that it will be retained forever. This includes articles, user pages, comments, discussion groups and talk pages. Some limited exceptions are described below. 

If you choose to join the community and register for the site you will have an option to provide an email address. If you provide a valid email address you will periodically be invited to attend community research meetings and other activities. By registering on Wikibon and providing an accurate email address you are opting in for these notifications. If you receive such an invitation and do not want to be on the distribution list, please follow the instructions in the invitation to remove yourself from the invitee list. 

##  Publishing on the wiki and public data

Simply visiting the web site does not expose your identity publicly (see Private logging below). 

When you edit any page in the wiki, **you are publishing a document**. This is a public act, and you are identified publicly with that edit as its author. 

###  Identification of an author

When you publish a page in the wiki, you mused be logged in. When you are logged in and make a contribugtion, you will be identified by your user name or alias, whichever you have selected in your profile. This may be your real name if you so choose, or you may choose to publish under a pseudonym, whatever user name you selected when you created your account. 

Wikibon has in the past allowed users to edit articles without being logged in and may choose to do so in the future. If you have not logged in and are able to make an edit for whatever reason, you will be identified by your network IP address. This is a series of four numbers which identifies the Internet address from which you are contacting the wiki. Depending on your connection, this number may be traceable only to a large Internet service provider, or specifically to your school, place of business, or home. It may be possible that the origin of this IP address could be used in conjunction with any interests you express implicitly or explicitly by editing articles to identify you even by private individuals. 

It may be either difficult or easy for a motivated individual to connect your network IP address with your real-life identity. Therefore if you are very concerned about privacy, you may wish to log in and publish under a pseudonym. 

When using a pseudonym, your IP address will not be available to the public except in cases of abuse, including vandalism of a wiki page by you or by another user with the same IP address. In all cases, your IP address will be stored on the wiki servers and can be seen by Wikibon's server administrators and by users who have been granted ["CheckUser"](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/CheckUser "http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/CheckUser") access. Your IP address, and its connection to any usernames that share it may be released under certain circumstances (see below). 

If you use a company mail server from home or telecommute and use a DSL or cable Internet connection, it is likely to be very easy for your employer to identify your IP address and find all of your IP based Wikibon contributions. Using a user name is a better way of preserving your privacy in this situation. However, remember to log out or disconnect yourself after each session when using a pseudonym on a shared computer, to avoid allowing others to use your identity. 

###  Cookies

The wiki will set a temporary session cookie (PHPSESSID) whenever you visit the site. If you do not intend to ever log in, you may deny this cookie, but you cannot log in without it. It will be deleted when you close your browser session. 

More cookies may be set when you log in, to avoid typing in your user name (or optionally password) on your next visit. These can last up to 30 days. You may clear these cookies after use if you are using a public machine and don't wish to expose your username to future users of the machine. (If so, clear the browser cache as well.) 

###  Passwords

Many aspects of the Wikibon community interactions depend on the reputation and respect that is built up through a history of valued contributions. User passwords are the only guarantee of the integrity of a user's edit history. All users are encouraged to select strong passwords and to never share them. No one shall knowingly expose the password of another user to public release either directly or indirectly. 

##  Private logging

Every time you visit a web page, you send a lot of information to the web server. Most web servers routinely maintain access logs with a portion of this information, which can be used to get an overall picture of what pages are popular, what other sites link to this one, and what web browsers people are using. It is not the intention of Wikibon to use this information to keep track of legitimate users. 

These logs are used to produce the [site statistics pages](http://wikibon.org/wiki/v/Special:Statistics/Statistics "http://wikibon.org/wiki/v/Special:Statistics/Statistics"); the raw log data is not made public, and is normally discarded after about two weeks. 

Here's a sample of what's logged for one page view: 
    
    
    69.172.32.138 - - [01/Mar/2006:09:15:14 +0000]
    "GET /wiki/draft_privacy_policy HTTP/1.1" 200 19350
    "http://www.wikibon.org/index.php?title=Implementing_tiered_storage
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/85.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/85.5"
    

Log data may be examined by developers in the course of solving technical problems and in tracking down badly-behaved web spiders that overwhelm the site. IP addresses of users, derived either from those logs or from records in the database are frequently used to correlate usernames and network addresses of edits in investigating abuse of the wiki, including the suspected use of malicious "sockpuppets" (duplicate accounts), vandalism, harassment of other users or disruption of the wiki. 

###  Policy on release of data derived from page logs

It is the policy of Wikibon that personally identifiable data collected in the server logs, or through records in the database via the CheckUser feature, may be released by the system administrators or users with CheckUser access, in the following situations: 

  1. In response to a valid subpoena or other compulsory request from law enforcement 
  2. With permission of the affected user 
  3. To the chair of The Wikibon Project, their legal counsel, or their designee, when necessary for investigation of abuse complaints. 
  4. Where the information pertains to page views generated by a spider or bot and its dissemination is necessary to illustrate or resolve technical issues. 
  5. Where the user has been vandalizing articles or persistently behaving in a disruptive way, data may be released to assist in the targeting of IP blocks, or to assist in the formulation of a complaint to relevant Internet Service Providers 
  6. Where it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Wikibon, its users or the public. 



Wikibon policy does not permit public distribution of such information under any circumstances, except as described above. 

##  Sharing information with third parties

Except where otherwise specified, all text added to Wikibon is available for reuse under the terms of the GFDL. 

Wikibon will not sell or share private information, such as email addresses, with third parties, unless you agree to release this information, or it is required by law to release the information. 

##  Security of information

Wikibon makes no guarantee against unauthorized access to any information you provide. This information may be available to anyone with access to Wikibon servers. 

##  E-mail, mailing lists and IRC

###  E-mail

You may provide your e-mail address in your Profile and enable other logged-in users to send email to you through Wikibon. Your address will not be revealed to them unless you respond, or possibly if the email bounces, or if you have set your privacy settings to allow other users to see your address. The email address may be used by Wikibon to communicate with users on a wider scale. 

If you do not provide an email address, you will not be able to reset your password if you forget it. However, you may contact one of the Wikibon server administrators to enter a new mail address in your preferences/profile. 

You can remove your email address from your profile/preferences at any time to prevent it being used. 

###  Mailing lists

If you subscribe to one of Wikibon's mailing lists the policies of that mailing list will govern use of your email and username. In any case, Wikibon will not make your email public without your persmission. 

###  Information email addresses

External email may be forwarded to a team of volunteers trusted by Wikibon to view them and answer them. Mail sent to Wikibon is not publicly visible, but is visible to this group of Wikibon volunteers. By sending a mail to one of these addresses, your address may become public within this group. The Wikibon services team may discuss the contents of your mail with other contributors in order to best answer your query. 

Mail to inquiry AT wikiBon DOT org or to feedback AT wikibon DOT org or to board members' private addresses may also be forwarded to the Wikibon team. 

###  IRC

[IRC channels](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/IRC_channels "http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/IRC_channels") are not officially part of Wikibon proper. By participating in an IRC channel, your IP address may be exposed to other participants. Different channels have different policies on whether logs may be published. 

##  User data

Data on users, such as the times at which they edited and the number of edits they have made are publicly available via "user contributions" lists, and in aggregated forms published by other users. 

###  Removal of user accounts

Once created, user accounts will not be removed. It may be possible for a username to be changed (depending on the policies of your local wiki and on the number of edits you have). The Wikibon Foundation does not guarantee that a name will be changed on request. 

Whether specific user information is deleted is dependent on the deletion policies of the project that contains the information. 

##  Deletion of content

Removing text from Wikibon pages does not permanently delete it. In normal articles, anyone can look at a previous version and see what was there. If an article is "deleted", any user with "administrator" access on the wiki, meaning almost anyone trusted not to abuse the deletion capability, can see what was deleted. Information can be permanently deleted by those people with access to the servers, but there is no guarantee this will happen except in response to legal action.
