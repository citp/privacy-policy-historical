<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Our website makes use of cookies. Cookies are small text files stored on the user's computer and transmitted to our site by the user. Therefore, you as a user have full control over the use of cookies. You can deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies by changing the settings in your Internet browser. Cookies that have already been saved can be deleted at any time. This can also be done automatically. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our website.</p>
<h2>Server Data</h2>
<p>For technical reasons, data such as the following, which your internet browser transmits to us or to our web space provider (so called server log files), is collected: - type and version of the browser you use - operating system - websites that linked you to our site (referrer URL) - pages that you visit - date and time of your visit - your Internet Protocol (IP) address. This anonymous data is stored separately from any personal information you may have provided, thereby making it impossible to connect it to any particular person.</p>
<p>The data is used for statistical purposes in order to improve our website and services and to protect our services against malicious activity. The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of data in log files is mandatory for the operation of the website. Consequently, there is no possibility for the user to object.</p>
<p>Log files are automatically deleted after 30 days unless needed as evidence during an abuse investigation.</p>
<h2>SSL encoding</h2>
<p>To protect the security of your data during transmission, we use state-of-the-art encryption methods (e.g. SSL) via HTTPS.</p>

<p>All e-mails directed at us are processed by our e-mail provider Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, under an existing data processing agreement.</p>
<p>Please note that unencrypted emails may be intercepted and read by third parties during the transfer. If you wish to communicate encrypted, you may contact us to provide you with an end-to-end encryption key.</p>
<p>The user has the right to revoke his consent to the processing of his personal data at any time. If the user contacts us by e-mail, he can object to the storage of his personal data at any time. In such a case, the conversation cannot be continued and all personal data stored in the course of establishing contact will be deleted.</p>

However, if the data are necessary for the fulfilment of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, premature deletion of the data is only possible insofar as there are no contractual or legal obligations to the contrary.</p>
