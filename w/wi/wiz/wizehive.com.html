		<p>Your privacy is important to WizeHive ("WizeHive"). This privacy statement provides information about the personal information that WizeHive collects, and the ways in which WizeHive uses that personal information. We reserve the right to change this Policy from time to time and will notify you of any changes via email or on our web site.</p>
		<h3>Information Collected</h3>
		<p>WizeHive collects personal information for those who register to use WizeHive. Personal information may include your username, your password (we only store an encrypted version of this; not the actual password), one or more email addresses and other contact information. For paying customers we may ask for additional information such as credit card number, billing address and related information.</p>
		<p>Like most web-based services, WizeHive automatically collects information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. This information may include, but is not limited to, your computer's Internet Protocol address, browser type, the web page you were visiting before you came to our Site and information you search for on our Site.</p>
		<p>Like many websites, we also use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use "persistent cookies" to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site; and we use "session ID cookies" to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Site. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of our services.</p>
		<h3>Information Use</h3>
		<p>WizeHive uses the information collected to enable your access to and use of the website services, to personalize the website for you, or to supply you services that you have asked for. If you are a paying customer we will also use this information to charge your credit card or collect payments from you.</p>
		<p>WizeHive may also occasionally contact you via email to tell you about WizeHive maintenance, upgrades and new features regarding WizeHive or promotions on behalf of other third parties, but will provide you with a vehicle for opting out of these emails.</p>
		<p>WizeHive will never disclose data on an individual or identifiable basis to third parties except when we must comply with laws that require such disclosure to law enforcement authorities or other government third party officials such as subpoenas.</p>
		<h3>Security</h3>
		<p>We use industry standard security measures to protect against the loss and misuse of information within our control. <br>
		You can read more about our <a href="../security/">security policy here</a>.</p>
		<h3>Other websites &amp; Links</h3>
		<p>At some point there may be links to other websites or services included within WizeHive. WizeHive makes no representation or warranties and is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of any third party.</p>
		<h3>Children</h3>
		<p>WizeHive is designed to be used for people over 13 years of age. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") protects the online privacy of children under 13 years of age. WizeHive does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from anyone under the age of 13, unless or except as permitted by law. Any person who provides Personal Information through WizeHive represents to us that he or she is 13 years of age or older. If WizeHive learns that Personal Information has been collected from a user under 13 years of age on or through the WizeHive Platform, then WizeHive will take the appropriate steps to cause this information to be deleted.</p>
		<h3>Chanage of Ownership</h3>
		<p>In the event of a change in ownership, or a merger with, acquisition by, or sale of assets to, another entity, we reserve the right to transfer all of your Personal Information, including email addresses, to that entity. WizeHive will use reasonable efforts to notify registered users of such a transfer (by a posting on our home page, or by email to a Ning Member's email address that was provided to us, as chosen by us in our discretion).</p>
		<h3>Changes and Updates to This Privacy Policy</h3>
		<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. If we do, we will update the "effective date" at the top of the Privacy Policy. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about our collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information. Your continued use of WizeHive constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.</p>
		<h3>Contacting WizeHive</h3>
		<p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@wizehive.com">privacy@wizehive.com</a>.</p>
