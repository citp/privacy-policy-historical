# Wizarding World - Privacy policy

SPAM SUCKS!

That is our Wizarding World policy.

Wizarding World will not spam you or sell your personal information to anyone else, and would appreciate that you return the favor to us.

Wizarding World will only collect the minimal amount of information necessary to have fun.

COMMENTS   
One way we have fun is by obtaining comments from our visitors. The only information we want is your comments. If you are willing to give us a screen name, your own name (first name only - if you are concerned), or your city and/or state/province, that makes it more fun for everyone, but that not required. Your comments, alone, are appreciated :o)

Your email will NEVER be posted on our site.

COOKIES   
Wizarding World uses cookies for our Opinion Polls. That is the only place that we use cookies, and we do not do anything else with cookies.

CONTESTS   
Wizarding World runs contests, and we have not figured out yet how to run a contest without at least getting emails (if anyone knows, please tell us - it would be nice not have to go through so much mail). We do not put your email addresses in a database, and we do not share your email addresses with anyone else. NO EXCEPTIONS - so don't even ask if you were thinking about it.

During the contest, we may ask for city, state/province, country or other general information so visitors can have fun relating to their own areas, but that would not be required to play the games.   
We will not even bother to collect any personally-identifiable information until the winners have been chosen. At that time, we will need to collect shipping address for only the winners in order to mail out prizes. 

CHILDREN ARE SAFE HERE - OUR WIZARDING WORLD KIDS PRIVACY POLICY

Children can surf WizardingWorld.com or other WayCoolStuff sites, view content, and play some games without any personally identifiable information being collected. However, in some areas it is necessary to collect personally identifiable information from kids to allow participation in an activity (like entering a contest) or to ask us questions (via e-mail).

Wizarding World maintains a policy not to collect more personally identifiable information from kids 16 and younger than is necessary for them to participate in our online activities. In addition, be aware that all sites that are targeted to children 12 and younger are prohibited by U.S. law from collecting more information than they need.

The only personally identifiable information we collect from kids 16 and under is first name, state/province and country, and parent's e-mail address. Although Visitors 16 and younger may be allowed to participate in contests where information is collected, notification and prizes are sent to the parents'/guardians' e-mail address provided during the contest entry process. For contest winners, we will contact the parent/guardian via email and obtain permission to ship prizes plus the necessary shipping address. This permission will be asked for every underage winner EVERY TIME they receive a prize (mostly because we do not save personal information).

Once we receive confirmation that the prizes have been received, NONE of the personal information will be stored in a database. The only electronic form where we may retain any information is copies of email comments for promotion on our site. Contest winner first names and states/provinces and countries will be used to announce winners and to verify that the prizes have been awarded to someone.

Parents/Guardians may refuse to have their children participate at any time, and we will honor that request - removing their entry from our records. If the parent/guardian requests that their child not be allowed to participate in future contests as well, we will keep an electronic record of those who are not allowed to participate. We will notify the parents if the child attempts to continue participating, and will expect the parents/guardians to help prevent the child's continual violation of their decision.

Wizarding World does not market any products to consumers except to promote the site (t-shirts, etc.), and has no reason at this time to maintain contact with our visitors. Wizarding World may at any time quote comments about our site from email we have received, but it would similarly only contain nonidentifiable information in the form of a first name, nickname, or state/province and country. Since we would not know from just an email the age of visitors, for quoting comments, parents/guardians may not be contacted for permission.

No information collected from Visitors 16 and younger is used by Wizarding World for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside this site.

NOTE: This site contains links to other sites, so it is imperative to monitor the privacy policies of those other sites before submitting personal information there. Wizarding World has no control over how those sites do business. However, if you feel that a site to which we link is inappropriate or mis-uses personal information, please [contact us immediately](mailto:wizardingworld@waycoolstuffonline.com?subject=Privacy%20Issues) since we do not wish to be associated with any site that violates reasonable ethical policies.

BE WARNED!

We will give out personal information about any visitors if required by law, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or to protect ourselves and the safety and security of our other visitors from individuals who threaten the safe operation of this site.
