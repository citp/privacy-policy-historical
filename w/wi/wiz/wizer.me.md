You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are providing us with Personal Information at your own free will, for the purposes described below, and that we may retain such Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and any applicable laws and regulations. 

Information Collected from Users 

We may collect two types of data and information from our Users: 

  1. The first type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to a User(s), which may be made available or gathered via the User's use of  the Wizer.me Platform   (  “  Non-personal Information  ”  ).  We are not aware of the identity of the User from which the Non-personal Information was collected  . Non-personal Information which is being collected consists of technical information and aggregated usage information, and may contain, among other things, the activity of the User on  the Wizer.me Platform  , type of operation system, User's 'click-stream' on  the Wizer.me Platform   and/or any e-commerce websites operated by third parties (including Third Party Services, as such term is defined in the Terms), browser type, language and keyboard language, etc. 


  2. The second type of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual, or may be of private or sensitive nature (“  Personal Information  ”).   



Personal Information which may be gathered consists of the following: 

  * The User's IP address or other persistent user identifier, which is automatically provided by the User  and used mainly for enhancing the User's experience and for geolocation personalization and security purposes, as further detailed below; 
  * Any Personal Information provided voluntarily by the User via the Wizer.me Platform, such as the User's e-mail address in order to be contacted, the User's answers to questions presented to the User through the Wizer.me Platform, including the User’s full name and password, and/or other actions performed by the User in connection with the Wizer.me Platform;

  * Personal Information regarding Student Activity including timestamps and events for when a student accomplishes a particular assignment as designated by a User; and/or

For avoidance of doubt, any Non-personal Information connected or linked to any Personal Information shall be deemed as Personal Information as long as such connection or linkage exists. 

We do not collect any Personal Information from you or related to you without your approval, which is obtained,  inter alia  , through your active acceptance to the Terms and this Privacy Policy. 

How We Collect Information on Our Users 

There are two main methods we use: 

  1. We collect information through your use of the Wizer.me Platform  . In other words, when you are using the Wizer.me Platform we are aware of it and may gather, collect and record the information relating to such usage, either independently or through the help of third-party services as detailed below. 
  2. We collect information   which you provide us voluntarily  . For example,  we collect Personal Informatio  n which you voluntarily provide when you contact us directly. We may also collect Personal Information you voluntarily provide through integration with your Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Gmail and/or Edmodo account. 



We store the Personal Information either independently or through the help of our authorized third-party service providers as detailed below.
