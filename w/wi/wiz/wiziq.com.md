2\. Uses of personal information

WizIQ is an online service dedicated to helping all learners and teachers to connect more effectively with one another. The personally identifiable information you choose to provide on this site is used to help you describe yourself to other users. Other information, that does not personally identify you as an individual is collected by WizIQ from the site (such as, by the way of example, patterns of utilization) and is exclusively owned by WizIQ. This information can be utilized by WizIQ in such a manner as WizIQ, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.

**WizIQ Communications:**  
WizIQ will communicate with you through email and notices posted on WizIQ website. This includes a series of welcome emails (up to 5) that inform new users about various features of the service. Please be aware that you will always receive emails from WizIQ concerning the proper functioning of your account such as email notices when another user in your network sends you an opportunity. WizIQ may send you promotional information unless you have opted out of receiving such information.

3\. Information Sharing

**Sharing Information With Third Parties:**

WizIQ takes the privacy of its users very seriously. We will never sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to any third party or parties for marketing purposes. We will only share this information with third parties to carry out your instructions and to provide you specific services. 

For instance, we use the services of a credit card processing company to bill our users for subscription fees. These third parties do not retain, share, or store this personally identifiable information or its part other than a purpose to provide these services and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information.

WizIQ offers a “web profile” feature which allows users to publish portions of their WizIQ profile, including your “name”, but not your “email address” to the public Internet. Users may opt-out of this feature however WizIQ does not warrant how third-party search engines will update their cache.

We may provide aggregated data about the usage of our services to third-parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate. We may segment our users by role (i.e. students, adult learner), subject, geographic location, or by company. If you would like to be excluded from the aggregated research or products based upon aggregated data about our users’ activities on the site, please email WizIQ’s customer service.

**Partnering with Other Organizations to Offer Combined Services:**  
WizIQ partners with other online services to give you the combined results of both services. Whenever we offer such combined services, it will always be your choice to make use of the combined services or not. In these cases, your personally identifiable information will only be passed from WizIQ to our partner if you choose to use the combined service. 

**Communications between Users:**  
Many emails you initiate through WizIQ, will list your email address and name in the header of the message. Other communications that you initiate through the WizIQ website, like a request for teacher, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal contact information. Your contact information will only be shared with another user if both of you have indicated your interest to establish contact with each other. 

4\. Legal Disclaimer:

It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information when required by law. We will disclose such information wherein we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order, ongoing judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on our company or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

5\. Accessing and Changing Your Account Information

You can review the personal information you provided us and make any desired changes to the information, or to the settings for your WizIQ account any time by logging into your account on the WizIQ website and editing the information on your Profile page. You can also close your account on the WizIQ website. If you close your WizIQ account, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our publicly viewable data. We may retain certain data contributed by you if it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law. All retained data will continue to be subject to the terms of the WizIQ Privacy Policy that you have previously agreed to.
