We will only share this information with third parties to carry out your instructions and to provide you specific services. For instance, we use the services of a credit card processing company to bill our users for subscription fees. These third parties do not retain, share, or store this personally identifiable information or its part other than a purpose to provide these services and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information.

WiZiQ offers a “web profile” feature which allows users to publish portions of their WiZiQ profile, including your “name”, but not your “email address” to the public Internet. Users may opt-out of this feature however WiZiQ does not warrant how third-party search engines will update their cache.

We may provide aggregated data about the usage of our services to third-parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate. We may segment our users by role (i.e. students, adult learner), subject, geographic location, or by company. If you would like to be excluded from the aggregated research or products based upon aggregated data about our users’ activities on the site, please email WiZiQ’s customer service.

**_Partnering with Other Organizations to Offer Combined Services:_**  
WiZiQ partners with other online services to give you the combined results of both services. Whenever we offer such combined services, it will always be your choice to make use of the combined services or not. In these cases, your personally identifiable information will only be passed from WiZiQ to our partner if you choose to use the combined service.

Your contact information will only be shared with another user if both of you have indicated your interest to establish contact with each other.

It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information when required by law.
