**What Information Does Wizards Collect?**

Wizards collects information from you on a voluntary basis when you:

  * create a profile to participate in Wizards community features
  * create an account
  * participate in organized play
  * shop at one of our affiliate online stores
  * give credit card information to make purchases from our Websites*
  * enter a shipping and billing address when making a purchase
  * participate in contests, events, or promotions
  * send questions or comments to Wizards customer service
  * submit your resume to us online
  * fill out online surveys



*While Wizards may collect credit card data from its customers from time to time, it will also use third party credit card processing companies to process your payment transactions. When using such a third party processing company, Wizards will not have access to your credit card data. The requested information may include personal information such as your name, email address, birth date, telephone number, and home address. In addition, we may request demographic information such as your age, gender, and household data.

If you are under the age of 13, some features of our Websites may be unavailable to you. For others, you will need your parent or guardian's consent before you can provide any personal information to us for purposes of registration and other online activities. Kids, if you are ever unsure about anything you are seeing on the Websites, ask your parent or guardian for help. See _Note To Parents_ below for more information.

To register an account with Wizards, you must, at a minimum, provide your date of birth, location, a user name and password. To participate in other Wizards offerings, such as organized play, you may be required to provide your first name and last name, city, country, postal code, gender, email address, password, user name and screen name.

Your personal profile (“Your Profile”) at community.wizards.com will be automatically populated with the screen name you provided at registration. The information in Your Profile, including any information or content you voluntarily add to Your Profile such as first and last name and images you upload, will be made public by default and will not be subject to this policy, unless you set Your Profile to “Private”. To change Your Profile privacy settings, log in to community.wizards.com and go to Your My Account tab then click “Edit Public Profile & Settings”. In this section, you may also change Your Profile information, who can view your page and activity, and who can contact you on the Site, as well as control how we communicate with you.

Your Profile will be searchable by screen name. You can change the visibility of your profile by de-selecting the “Profile is visible to other users” and “Profile is searchable” boxes in Privacy Settings. Please note: The photo you selected (you are not required to upload a personal photo) as your avatar and your screen name will always display on your page, posts, and in search results. Information and content you choose to make public either through Your Profile, or by posting on the Websites, are not subject to this policy.

Wizards also collects information from you at other points on the Websites, as described below:

  *  **Message Boards, Forums, Blogs and Social Networking** Wizards provides message boards, blogs and other public forums on the Websites for exchanging information and social networking. Please note that any information, user content or any other materials that you post on our Websites, including any information from Your Profile that you choose to make public, will be available for any user of that service to read, and are therefore no longer private and may be disclosed without limitations as to use by a third party. If you post information, materials or other content on the Websites or other public forum, you are providing information that can be collected and used by others that you do not know, for their own purposes, including the distribution of unsolicited communications.



If you wish to review, correct, or delete content or information you have publicly posted through our message boards, forums, or blogs, you may do so by visiting the individual post and selecting the “Edit” or “Delete” options. Alternatively, you may contact us [here](http://company.wizards.com/contact-us) with your request. Please note that removal of this content or information from public view does not guarantee complete or comprehensive removal. After your removal request has been honored, we may retain copies of the content or information you have previously posted on our servers. Additionally, we are not required to remove your posted content or information if it has been rendered anonymous or if we are required by law to retain it.

  *  **Online Stores**



Visitors purchasing goods and services through one of our affiliate online stores will need to provide a valid credit card number and expiration date, in addition to name, mailing address, phone number and email address.

  *  **Promotions**  
To participate in some of our promotions, you may be asked to provide an email address or screen name, so that we can let you know if you won a prize. For other Wizards promotions, we may request your name and home address in order to send you products or information by regular mail.  
 


  *  **Customer Service**



When you contact customer service you may be asked to provide us with personal information such as your name, telephone number, address and email. We collect this information as part of our customer service efforts and it is used to confirm your identity, respond to your inquiry or comments, for training purposes, and to assist us in providing better products and services.

  *  **Wizards Play Network**



Participants, including store owners and event organizers, have the opportunity to sign up with the Wizards Play Network in order to run organized play events. You must provide certain personally identifiable information to be eligible to participate in organized play.

  *  **Resumes**  
Our Websites allow for the online submission of resumes. Personal information collected from resumes is not subject to this Privacy Policy. However, we can assure you that such information will be used solely for the purpose of accepting and evaluating candidate submissions for job postings.  
 


  *  **Online Surveys**



In order to improve the user experience at our Websites, we may employ online surveys for visitors to volunteer anonymous demographic information about themselves and provide us feedback about why they visit our Websites and what we can do to make them better. Information collected through these surveys is anonymous; we cannot identify who is submitting the information or tie it to other personally identifiable information a user may have provided us through another means.

Whatever the activity may be, we will only collect information to the extent it is reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives. If you do not want to submit personal information when requested, you will not be able to access certain areas on our Websites or take advantage of certain features of our Websites. However, you do not need to provide personal information to Wizards in order to use our Websites.

 **Social Media**

You can also engage with our content on or through third-party social networking websites, such as Facebook and Twitter (or third-party social media plug-ins and applications). When you engage with our content on or through third-party social networking websites, plug-ins and applications, you may allow us to have access to certain information from your social media profile (e.g., name, email address, photo, gender, birthday, location, your list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the ‘likes’ you make) to deliver the content or as part of the operation of the application. We may also obtain non-personally identifiable information (e.g., content viewed, game performance, high scores, and information about advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on) from your interaction with our content.

When you provide information from your social media account, it can help enable us to do things like (1) give you exclusive content, (2) personalize your online experience with us within and outside our Websites (and or applications), and (3) contact you through the social networking Websites or directly by sending you the latest news, special offerings, and rewards. By doing so, you consent to the use of this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. When you provide personal information to us through an application, on our Websites, or on social networking websites, it may be publicly viewed by other members of these websites and we cannot prevent further use of the information by third parties.

Through some social networking websites’ privacy settings, you can control what data you share. For more information about how social networking websites handle your personal information, please refer to their respective privacy policies and terms of use.

 **Clear GIFs, Cookies and IP Addresses**

Clear GIFs, sometimes called "web bugs" or “pixel tags,” or “web beacons” are file objects, usually a graphic image such as a transparent one pixel-by-one pixel GIF (Graphics Interchange Format, one of the two most common file formats for images on the Web), that are placed on a web page or in an email message to monitor user behavior. The GIF tells us the IP address of the computer that fetched our page, the URL of the page the GIF is on, the time the page was viewed, the type of browser used, and it can also identify a previously set cookie value, and how and where a user accessed a website. This anonymous information is returned by the clear GIF to Wizards and we use this information to accurately count visitors across our Websites and understand how they navigate and use our network of Websites. We not combine information gathered through clear GIFs with your personal information.

We use "cookies" to enhance your experience at our Websites and to understand how you interact with our Websites, products and services. Cookies are pieces of information that we place on your computer to help us accurately understand how many consumers are visiting a particular site, how often they visit that site and what content they are most interested in viewing. For example, a cookie will allow us to remember certain things based on your Internet Protocol or "IP" address (an IP address is the string of numbers that identifies each sender or receiver of information that is sent across the Internet), such as the time and duration of your visits, how you navigated through our content and where you exited a particular site. To learn more about how we use cookies, please visit our [Cookie Policy](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/cookie-policy).

Wizards' Websites collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our Websites. When visitors request pages on one of our Websites, our servers log the visitors' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our community rules, [Code of Conduct](http://company.wizards.com/conduct), or posted Terms of Use, or to protect our Services, Websites, customers, or others.

 **Log Files**

Other information passively collected by Wizards is in the form of log-files that record web site activity and gather statistics about web users' browsing habits. These entries are generated anonymously, and help Wizards determine (among other things) how many and how often users have visited our Websites, which pages they've visited, and other similar data. We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you.

**Who is Collecting My Information and How Will It Be Used?**

We, or our third party partners and service providers, collect information you provide through our Websites or when you interact with us. We may use the information you submit to us to send you advertising or promotional materials including information about new products, contests, features and enhancements, special offers and other events of interest. We may also use your personal information for our internal research and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve our products and services. The demographic information (e.g., age and gender) you provide us is collected by Wizards and may be disclosed in aggregate to third parties. This aggregate demographic information cannot be used to personally identify you or your computer.

Third parties who fulfill online services such as hosting or customer service may collect the personal information you provide through our Websites. These third parties will not use your personal information for any purpose other than to provide the related services, and have agreed to maintain confidentiality, surveys, security, and integrity of your personal information.

 **With Whom Does Wizards Share My Personal Information?**

Wizards may share your information with its related entities including its parent and sister companies. Wizards may also share personal information with third party service providers who assist us with operating our Websites or provide us with various services (e.g. organized play, community operations, online product fulfillment, prize payments, email services, marketing and promotional services, or technical support). These entities will not use your personal information for any other purpose than that for which it was received by Wizards, and they agree to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of all information (personal or otherwise) they receive from us.

Wizards also may disclose your personal information in order to fulfill a service to you. For example, if you are entering a contest, we may use your personally identifiable information in order to fulfill the terms of that promotion. This means that we may share the information for prize fulfillment purposes or mail carriers. Also, if you make a purchase on one of our Websites, your credit card data may have to be disclosed to an unaffiliated third party payment processing company as necessary to complete your purchase (for example, to process your credit card). In the event that such data is shared, Wizards will take all reasonable steps to ensure applicable third parties adequately protect the data.

We may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law including, but not limited to, disclosure to law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability.

Except as set forth herein, Wizards of the Coast LLC, as a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc. does not sell or rent personal information collected from and about its customers (including children under 13) to third parties. However, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, Wizards' customer information may be transferred to Wizards' successors or assigns.

If you engage in organized play, your full name, DCI number, city, state, nationality and email will be accessible by authorized tournament organizers, retail locations that are part of the Wizards Play Network, members of the Wizards’ community that are adjudicating organized play events, and prize fulfillment service providers. These parties are independent of Wizards of the Coast, but will not use your personal information for any other purpose than that for which it was received by Wizards, and they agree to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of all information (personal or otherwise) they receive from us. Your personal information may also be disclosed to members of the Wizards’ community who are engaged in investigating violations of tournament rules and the Code of Conduct. Additionally, your full name, city, and country may appear in online leaderboards and organized play event results.

Wizards’ servers reside in the United States. If you choose to provide us with personally identifiable information (e.g., through email, account creation, participating in organized play, or by contacting customer service), such information may not only be shared with our parent company (its affiliates and subsidiaries) and third party service providers (as provided in this policy), it may also be transferred across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.

If you reside in the European Union or in countries with laws governing data collection and use that differ from the United States, please note that by providing Wizards with your personally identifiable information, you are expressly consenting to the transfer of your personally identifiable information to the United States as well as other jurisdictions where Wizards conducts business or provides services.

**A** **Note to Parents**

Wizards has developed its Websites to be an enjoyable experience for children (and adults) of all ages. We recognize that some younger children may not understand some of the information contained on the Websites or how the Websites operate. That is the purpose of the Privacy Policy. Please discuss this statement with your children so that they will better understand how to use the Websites and the information they may be asked to provide. Wizards strongly believes that providing its visitors with accurate and adequate notice about the Websites will lead to informed choices and decisions about how to use the Websites, as well as protect its users' privacy.

**Teenagers (Ages 13-17)**

Wizards may collect personal information from users over 12 and under 18 (each a "teenager"). When a user in this age category submits personal information, Wizards may, but has not obligation, to request a parent or guardian's email address to notify the parent or guardian of the teenager's activity. Personal information collected from these visitors is subject to the policies set forth above.

 **Children Under 13**

 **Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information**

Wizards may collect and store personal information about children under 13 ("children" or "child") if it is submitted by way of our registration form and with the parent's or legal guardian’s verifiable consent. To determine who is younger than 13 years old and whether parental consent is required, we ask all users who wish to register to submit their date of birth. Those users that indicate they are under 13 years of age are directed to a Parental Consent Form. The Parental Consent Form is available for viewing [here](http://media.wizards.com/downloads/wizardsaccount/coppawizardsparentalconsentform_en.pdf), and it must be signed and returned to Wizards by email, mail or fax, before we will collect information from users who have indicated they are children. If we learn or have reason to suspect that we have collected personal information from a child without parental consent, we will promptly delete it.

If given verifiable permission from a parent or legal guardian, Wizards may collect and store personal information about a child under 13 including her/his full name, email address, mailing address, parent's or legal guardian's name, and parent's or legal guardian's email address. Wizards may also collect demographic information about a child such as the child's date of birth, gender, and other preferences; and, combine such information with the child's personal information. Wizards will only collect this information if it is voluntarily submitted to us by the child or parent/legal guardian and provided with the parent's or legal guardian’s signed permission.

The information that a child provides on his/her registration form may be used to: (a) allow the child to participate in activities on our Websites; (b) participate in organized play (e.g., contests); and, (c) allow us to send the child promotional materials, including information about new products, contests, features and enhancements, special offers, and other events of interest.

Wizards may share kids' personal information with outside entities hired to assist with internal website support operations (e.g., online product fulfillment, email services, or technical support). These entities will not use kids' personal information for any other purpose, and have agreed to maintain confidentiality, surveys, security, and integrity of all the personal information they obtain from us.

We may also use the information to improve the products and services we provide our visitors and to better meet their needs.

Other areas of our Websites will facilitate a child’s participation in our Community features such as forums, wikis, and blogs, as well as creation of a profile. Your child’s participation may result in public disclosure of the personal information he or she posts through these features. We will take all reasonable measures to delete any personal information of a child posted through our Community features if and when such information is discovered.

 **Disclosure of Children's Personal Information**

Wizards may share children's personal information with outside entities hired to assist us with operating our Websites or providing Service (e.g. organized play, community operations, online product fulfillment, email services, marketing, promotions or technical support). These outside entities will not use this personal information for any other purpose, and have agreed to maintain confidentiality, surveys, security, and integrity of all the personal information they obtain from us.

We may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law including, but not limited to, disclosure to law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability.

Wizards does not sell, or rent personal information collected from and about its users (including children under 13) to third parties. However, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, Wizards' customer information may be transferred to Wizards' successors or assigns.
