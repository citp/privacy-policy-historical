Winamp offers you the ability to create a skin and post it for others to review and download. If you create a skin, we will show your user name and provide a link so that others can send you an email. We also give you the option to write a review of a skin. The review will appear with the skin and will contain your Winamp username. Our site automatically keeps track of the number of times a skin has been downloaded.
