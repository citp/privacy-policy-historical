From time to time, Winding Paths Art may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Winding Paths Art also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on windingpathsart.com blogs/sites. Winding Paths Art only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.
