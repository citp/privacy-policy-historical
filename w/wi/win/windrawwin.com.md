## How WinDrawWin Uses Cookies

We use cookies to personalise content and advertisements to make our website relevant to you, and to analyse our traffic. We also use cookies to ensure that our website is legally compliant with laws and regulations in different countries and regions of the world. For example, we may be restricted from showing you links to certain sportbooks where these companies do not have a licence to operate in your country.

A cookie is a small text file which is placed on your computer's hard drive when you visit websites.

Almost all websites use cookies. Cookies are used to help analyse web traffic, store your preferences, and track the path of your visit to a website from page to page to assist in cacheing and performance when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow websites to respond to you as an individual. The web site can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by remembering information about your preferences.

WinDrawWin uses cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about our traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We use this information for statistical analysis purposes, in particular Google Analytics.

Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to see which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any specific and personal information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.

We have explained below the types of cookie that we may set (with your consent), and the names of cookies themselves and what their purpose is.

## Types Of Cookie

While using WinDrawWin.com you may have one or two different types of cookie set on your device. These are 1st Party and 3rd Party Cookies and are now explained.

## 1st Party Cookies

1st party cookies are cookies that are set and used by WinDrawWin.com.

The cookies listed below are necessary cookies (unless otherwise specified) that help make our website usable by enabling basic functions like page navigation, content display, our own legal obligations to show or not show you content, and your preferences. The website cannot function properly without these cookies.

Below you will find a full list of the 1st party necessary cookies that WinDrawWin uses:

Cookie Name| Purpose  
---|---  
c | This is a cookie that stores the country in the world that you are browsing our website from. For example, UNITED KINGDOM. This cookie helps us tailor our content to users from that country, for example to ensure that we only display content to you that is legally allowed in your country.  
r | This is a cookie that stores the region of the world that you are browsing our website from. For example, Europe. This cookie helps us tailor our content to users from that region and serves the same purpose as the country cookie above.  
o | This is a cookie that stores your odds style preference - fractional or decimal. This enables us to show odds on our website in your preferred format. By default this cookie is not set. It is only set if you explicitly choose a different setting on our settings page.  
i | This is an optional cookie that stores a yes/no value to tell us whether we have shown you a home page interstitial advertisement. If you do not consent to us storing cookies you will not receive this cookie. We occasionally (but not all the time) promote a time bound offer or event on our home page. We use this cookie to ensure that we only show you this advertisement once in each 24 hour period, so not to reduce the user experience on our home page. If this cookie is not set then any advertisment will display on every visit to the home page.  
desktop | This is a cookie that stores your display preference - desktop or mobile. This enables you to view our website in its mobile responsive format (default) or our full width desktop version of the website. By default this cookie is not set. It is only set if you explicitly choose a different setting on our settings page.  
cookieconsent | This is a cookie that stores a yes or no value that indicates whether you have consented to the setting of cookies by WinDrawWin. This cookie allows us to not set unnecessary cookies on your device if you have withdrawn your consent  
ASPSESSIONID | Cookies that begin with ASPSESSIONID are integral to the programming language that our website is coded in. These cookies help our web server establish that you are the same user when you browse from page to page (i.e. they help our web server identify your 'session'. Session cookies are almost always deleted when you exit your browser and are only meant to help our web server identify your session while you browse our website, and help you by performing actions such as cacheing pages that you might visit multiple times within the same session.  
  
## 3rd Party Cookies

These cookies are set by other companies and organisations that WinDrawWin works with, or uses software provided by.

WinDrawWin also partners with a number of organisations and other websites to provide you content. For example, we display the latest free bet offers from a number of external companies.

The cookies that these companies may set while you use WinDrawWin.com are termed 3rd Party Cookies because they are not directly set by WinDrawWin.com, but are instead set by the external company.

We have taken steps to configure our Google Analytics so that Google will not store any data about you that can personally identify you. For example, we anonymise your IP address in Google Analytics, and we do not define any URLs on our website that contain data that is personal to you, and therefore will not be stored by Google.
