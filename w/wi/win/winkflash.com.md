# winkflash ;) your privacy is our top priority

Privacy Policy   
Use of Information  
Winkflash protects our customer information. We do not sell, share, or rent this information in ways other than listed in this privacy statement. 

Digital Image Ownership  
During the ordering process, customers are asked to confirm their ownership of submitted digital images. Only the copyright owners of digital images can request and order prints through our service. Customers retain full ownership of all images sent to us for printing. Winkflash does not use, publish or share your digital images or prints with any third party. Digital images are used exclusively to fulfill your print orders. 

Cookies  
Cookies may be used on this site to allow for movement between secure sections. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. 

Log Files  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, and to track user's movement. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

Links  
This website may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Winkflash is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Website. 

Choice/Opt-out  
We will not send users any promotional marketing materials or newsletters. The only e-mail communication a user receives is when there is a notification of change to the privacy statement or to send a confirmation e-mail when you activate/deactivate your account, or in response to your inquiries and/or purchases. As these emails are required to provide the service and not promotional in nature, generally you may not opt-out of these email communications.

Security  
Winkflash takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our registration/login forms ask users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card information), that information is encrypted and is protected with the most widely used encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, follow this link www.ssl.com 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices and our service provider's offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our technical team or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. 

If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via e-mail. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. However, if you have deleted/deactivated your account, then you will not be contacted. Nor will your personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. 

Legal Disclaimer  
Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. 

Service Providers  
We use third parties to provide merchant and credit card services on our site. When you purchase through winkflash, we will share billing information as necessary for the third party to provide that service. 

These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. 

Sharing Photos with Friends  
When you share photos with friends, you will be required to enter their name and email address. This information is used to send your friends notification that you have shared photos with them. We will not contact them for any other reason. Nor will we sell or rent their contact information. We will store their contact information in your account to allow you to easily communicate with them in the future. 

What Information is Collected  
When creating an account we collect contact information, such as your name and email address. When making a purchase we will collect shipping and billing address, phone number and credit card information. We collect this information in order to create an online account to house your digital photos and to allow you to purchase items from the website. 

Access to Personally Identifiable Information  
If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update or deactivate your account by making the change on our account information page or by [contacting us.](https://web.archive.org/web/20090923190411id_/http%3A//www.winkflash.com/content/contact.asp)

Changes to this Policy  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our homepage.
