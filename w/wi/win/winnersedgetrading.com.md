Privacy Policy  
Our Commitment To Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.  
The Information We Collect:

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Winners Edge Trading (www.winnersedgetrading.com) or Forex Power Group (www.forexpowergroup.com) website. On some pages, you can make requests, register as a member, or order additional products & services. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:

First Name  
Last Name  
Email address  
Timezone  
Trading style – for example: your preferred risk  
Information about your trading accounts, which can be real or fictional  
Your mobile/cell phone number (for SMS alerts)

We do not collect credit/debit card data or your billing address details. This information is recorded by the payment processing company (paypal.com, recurly.com, or authorize.net).  
The Way We Use Information:

We use your name and email address so that we can email you in regard to information that you have requested. We use the additional registration information to set up your membership profile. We may use your mobile / cell phone number to send automated SMS alerts for trading signals or news event warnings. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete the payment or registration process.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.  
Our Commitment To Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

We work to protect your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information that you provide online at our Web Site. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect your information, continue to assess new technology for protecting information, and when appropriate, upgrade our information security systems.  
Our Commitment To Children’s Privacy:

Protecting the privacy of the young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 18, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 18.  
How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information

You can unsubscribe from our email list(s) at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe button at the bottom of one of the emails sent to you. Alternatively, you can request removal from our lists by sending an email to info@winnersedgetrading.com.

You can access and change any personal information or trading preferences through the member profile screen. This is accessed within the Forex Power Group membership area.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
