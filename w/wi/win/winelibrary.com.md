You can choose not to provide the requested information, but you might not be able to take advantage of certain Site features.

**b. We automatically collect information about your browser or device, your use of the Site, and your browsing or search history when you interact with us.**

When you access and use the Site, our technology and tools automatically collect and record certain non-personally identifiable information about your use of the Site (including your IP address, your browser type, the make and model of device used to view the Site, location information, unique device identifiers, and other information relating to your use of the Site, browser or device). 

We also use cookies, pixels, web beacons, device or HTML5 local storage and caching, java script and other similar technologies to collect information about your use of and access to the Site, content or advertisements you view, and related to your activities on the Internet. Cookies are small bits of information that may be placed on your computer by web sites you visit, applications you use, or advertisements you view. Cookies alone tell us nothing about who you are, unless you or a third-party gives us personally identifiable information, which may then be linked to the data stored in the cookie. Pixels (or pixel tags, web beacons or clear GIFs) are small blocks of code placed on a web page or application that read and place cookies and transmit certain information, such as a browser or device’s IP address, when and how often the pixel was viewed, an identifier associated with the browser or device, or the type of browser being used.

**c. Third-parties may also automatically collect information about you.**

Some advertisements or embedded content on the Site are served by third-party advertising companies or third-party content providers. Please note that these companies may also use cookies, pixels or other similar technologies to collect information about you, both on the Site and throughout the Internet. We do not have control over third-party information collection and use.

**d. We may build a profile about you based on information you voluntarily provide us, information we automatically collect from you, and information obtained from third-parties.**
