## Authorization of use

All users who make their personal information available expressly authorize FNBox to use the data provided for the purposes stated herein. Providing this data also implies the user's acceptance of all of the terms contained in these Privacy Policy and in the Terms and Conditions. 

## Rights of the owners of the information.

In turn, and following from the guarantee of protected rights, FNBox allows those users who are linked to the registered data total access to information at any time. This allows the user to exercise rights to access, rectify or cancelled data and update information. Every user may carry out said rights by directing an email to: legal+winkal@fnbox.com

  1. The right to demand the rectification of the information:  
In principal, the right to demand rectification can be exercised in the event of falsification, inaccuracy, vagueness or character of the error that may be contained in the data. The recognition thereof entails that of preserving the accuracy of the information to ensure its quality.
  2. The right to require information to be updated:  
The update is based upon preserving the validity of the data, that is, the relationship of the information it represents within the temporal scope in which it is provided.
  3. The rights to addition and dissociation:  
Users may require that information be added to registered data if it is considered incomplete and is an inaccurate representation. Similarly, they may also demand the dissociation of data containing personal traits or characteristics which only allow for processing without the possibility of establishing associations or links to the owners of the data.
  4. Submission and Withdrawal Policy:  
The removal of an item of data implies that it has permanently been eliminated from the file or registry, that is, it has completely disappeared and there is no remaining evidence of its previous registration.
  5. Removal of personal information:  
Whenever an account is closed by the user or due to FNBox's decision, all personal information related to the account will be permanently removed from FNBox's systems. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain data will not be deleted if this could infringe the rights or legitimate interests of third parties, or if there is a legal obligation to retain the information.



Furthermore, once users have entered their data, FNBox may rectify, remove or update the users' personal information where appropriate.

## Adopted security measures

With respect to archives or databases that may contain personal information about the users, FNBox adopts all logical and physical security measures required by law and measures of suitable prudence and diligence in protecting third parties who have put their trust in FNBox. We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software to protect the security of your personal information, which only encrypts passwords. No company can fully prevent security risks, however. Mistakes may happen. Bad actors may defeat even the best safeguards.

Only employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to it. All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

FNBox may amend this privacy policy. Use of information we collect now is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes to our privacy policy, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Site so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances if any, it is disclosed.
