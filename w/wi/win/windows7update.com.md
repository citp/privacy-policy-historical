We understand consumers’ concerns over the use of their personal information. We hope this information will relieve any concerns your company may have regarding our email policies.

We obtain email addresses and personal information from third parties that follow the same set of policies. Email messages sent always include information about the origin of the emails and instructions on how recipients can unsubscribe from receiving future email messages.

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this website, you can contact us via the [contact form](http://www.eyeonwindows.com/contact-us/).
