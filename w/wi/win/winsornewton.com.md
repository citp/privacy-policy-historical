**2. What’s the point of this policy?**

2.1 This policy tells you how we deal with your “personal data” (that is, information about any identified or identifiable living persons). For the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation, we are the data controller in relation to personal data collected by us. Please read on to find out what kinds of personal data we collect, how we use and protect it, to whom we disclose it and how you can access and rectify it or request that we stop processing it.

2.2 By using the Site, you accept this policy, our terms and conditions and our cookie policy. Please do not use the Site unless you are completely happy with this policy, the cookie policy and the terms and conditions. If you do use the Site, we will assume that you do accept it.

**3. Might the policy change?**
