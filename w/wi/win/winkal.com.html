All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.</p></div><div class="brdTop sp2t sp2b"><h2 class="sp2t sp1b txtBold txtL">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2><p class="sp2b txtS">FNBox may amend this privacy policy.  Use of information we collect now is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time such information is used.
