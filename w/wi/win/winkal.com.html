        Users may require that information be added to registered data if it is considered incomplete and is an inaccurate representation. Similarly, they may also demand the dissociation of data containing personal traits or characteristics which only allow for processing without the possibility of establishing associations or links to the owners of the data.</li><li>Submission and Withdrawal Policy:<br>
        The removal of an item of data implies that it has permanently been eliminated from the file or registry, that is, it has completely disappeared and there is no remaining evidence of its previous registration.</li><li>Removal of personal information:<br>
        Whenever an account is closed by the user or due to FNBox's decision, all personal information related to the account will be permanently removed from FNBox's systems.

Bad actors may defeat even the best safeguards.</p><p class="sp2b txtS">Only employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to it.  All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.</p></div><div class="brdTop sp2t sp2b"><h2 class="sp2t sp1b txtBold txtL">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2><p class="sp2b txtS">FNBox may amend this privacy policy.  Use of information we collect now is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time such information is used.
