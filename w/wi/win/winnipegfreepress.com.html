That&rsquo;s a lot of pebbles, and the ripples are about to turn into waves. | Until now, those adoption records were sealed. Adoptees could ask social workers for non-identifying information about their biological parents &mdash; a social history that often included ethnic origins and medical details but with all the important stuff, names and towns and addresses, omitted. Birth parents could get similar information about where their child ended up, with all the vital parts, such as an adopted name, blacked out. Provincial social workers would facilitate reunions when they could, when both parties agreed. But thousands of Manitobans were left mired in mystery about their origins and identity, or the fate of the child they gave up years ago. | New legislation, long in the works and made official three weeks ago, changes all that. It unseals decades of records, allowing birth parents and adoptees to see everything &mdash; original birth certificates, home studies on adoptive families, hospital files, formal adoption forms and a host of other documents.","last_updated":"2015-07-08T15:12:35.000Z","full_image_width":1000,"full_image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/1000*744/150625-CYNTHIA_BOODENFIRTH-.jpg"},{"media_type":"Story","allow_comments":"comments","image_height":432,"id":310099891,"author":"Doug Speirs","title":"Expanding their horizons","last_modified":"2015-06-30T13:50:18.000Z","image_type":"normal","image_width":648,"path":"/local","dimensions":"648x432","full_image_height":667,"content_type":"FP Long Story","related_items":[],"image_title":"150604 2017 Aby .JPG","our_rating":"","image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/647*432/2017class_10.jpg","image_caption":"Aby sits on her bed in her room thinking of her dear, longtime friend Camryn that passed away earlier in the year from an illness.

In 1957, Fairlane continued, but was split into two series with the addition of the Fairlane 500 as the top level. With the introduction of the Galaxie in late 1959, both Fairlane models fell into line as Ford's mid-price offerings and remained there through 1961. For 1962, the base Fairlane and Fairlane 500 became part of Ford's new intermediate line. With several models and two trim levels to choose from, these large and stylish cars filled a marketing niche. Both models saw several styling changes throughout the first half of the 1960s and remained relatively popular sellers. The newly designed 1966 models, however, really signalled a winner for Ford, with strong sales and a loyal following that still lives on today in the collector-car hobby. | For Kevin Torrance of Winnipeg, he'd tinkered with his 1959 Ford Galaxie since he was 16 years old. He had taken on several minor bodywork and paint projects and felt he was ready to move forward with a more challenging project. &quot;I like all cars, but the Fairlane had a racing heritage from the days of NASCAR running on tracks like Daytona,&quot; says Torrance. &quot;The Fairlane was also a uni-body, fastback and fairly lightweight for its size.&quot; | After spotting a 1967 Fairlane 500 XL for sale in Winnipeg on Kijiji in November 2011, Torrance went to look it over and found a complete V-8-powered car in running order, basically complete and only missing the bucket seats and centre console. &quot;It did need a full restoration, but it ran well, so I made a cash offer,&quot; says Torrance, who also sweetened the deal in typical Winnipeg fashion by adding a snow blower on trade. | The car was hauled home on a flat-deck trailer and Torrance got to work taking it apart and stripping the body down to bare metal. Next came several months of welding to install new floorpans, toe boards, rocker panels and rear quarter panels. Next he stripped off the vinyl roof covering and began the laborious job of prepping the car for paint. As luck would have it, he spied another car on Kijiji that he purchased as a parts car. It offered a better hood, trunk lid, doors and front fenders, as well as a good cache of extra parts.","last_updated":"2015-11-06T09:00:00.000Z","full_image_width":1000,"full_image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/1000*665/7309793.jpg"},{"media_type":"Story","allow_comments":"comments","image_height":432,"id":343407112,"author":"Marco della Cava","title":"He will always be the King","last_modified":"2015-11-09T14:03:44.000Z","image_type":"normal","image_width":670,"path":"http://autos.winnipegfreepress.com/winnipeg-autos/","dimensions":"670x432","full_image_height":645,"content_type":"WFP Story","related_items":[],"image_title":"7322976","our_rating":"","image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/670*432/7322976.jpg","image_caption":"Late customizer George Barris with his most famous creation, the Batmobile.

Hasselmann said when it comes to luxury the 2016 7 Series is &quot;bursting at the seams.&quot; &quot;BMW owns Rolls-Royce, so the company knows a thing or two about luxury,&quot; says Hasselmann. | He compares riding in the interior to being in an executive lounge. Every passenger has their own removable tablet to control lighting and create just the right mood. Also available is a rear executive lounge seating package that features a centre console with a fold-out table, a reclining rear seat and a front seat that can be moved forward to reveal a flip-down footrest on the front seatback. The Vitality function was designed to create a feeling of well-being. To that end, all seats have a built-in massage capability. Hasselmann points out passengers (and driver) have a choice of up to eight different massage programs to massage tired muscles There's also an ionizer inside to eliminate any allergens. The Sky Lounge panoramic glass roof has 15,000 etchings in the glass and is illuminated by LED lights that can change colour to create just the right ambience. | Hasselmann further points out another new technological feature which is, so far, unique to this model. Gesture control is a step up on voice control. Function commands can be made with a variety of simple hand movements. For example, an overhead infrared camera converts a rotary-motion gesture to a louder or softer audio level. A wave of the hand brushes off incoming phone calls; pointing one finger answers the call. Two fingers in a V shape tells the nav system to guide you home.","last_updated":"2015-11-06T09:00:00.000Z","full_image_width":1000,"full_image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/1000*727/7310915.jpg"}],"v4_events":{"events":[{"title":"Trumpet Festival","category":"Festivals","categoryID":995083,"venue":"Centennial Concert Hall","url":"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/events/310154392.html"},{"title":"Ghosts/ Alice Jarry ","category":"Exhibitions & Fairs","categoryID":995078,"venue":"Martha Street Studio","url":"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/events/336368742.html"},{"title":"The Winnipeg Art Gallery presents Highlights of Inuit Sculpture Exhibition","category":"Theatre & Arts","categoryID":828797,"venue":"300 Memorial Boulevard","url":"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/events/258689811.html"},{"title":"The Winnipeg Art Gallery presents European Renaissance and Baroque Art: 1500-1700","category":"Theatre & Arts","categoryID":828797,"venue":"300 Memorial Boulevard","url":"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/events/258689821.html"},{"title":"The Winnipeg Art Gallery presents The Academic Tradition in Europe & Canada, 1700-1900","category":"Theatre & Arts","categoryID":828797,"venue":"300 Memorial Boulevard","url":"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/events/258689831.html"},{"title":"Understanding your Faith","category":"Religious & Spiritual","categoryID":871017,"venue":"McNally Robinson Booksellers","url":"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/events/303467041.html"},{"title":"Introduction to Christian Meditation","category":"Religious & Spiritual","categoryID":871017,"venue":"St Peter's , St Paul's, St Mary Magdalene and St Luke's Anglican Churches","url":"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/events/330594461.html"},{"title":"Jazz at the Bistro: Steve Kirby & Friends","category":"Jazz","categoryID":848497,"venue":"St Peter's , St Paul's, St Mary Magdalene and St Luke's Anglican Churches","url":"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/events/331044921.html"},{"title":"Geometric Journeys Art Exhibition & Sale","category":"Exhibitions & Fairs","categoryID":995078,"venue":"Portage & District Arts Centre","url":"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/events/331769025.html"},{"title":"Urban Barn Blankets the Country in Warmth","category":"Christmas","categoryID":828992,"venue":"1430 Ellice Avenue, 1585 Kenaston Boulevard, 1594 Regent Street West Urban Barn locations","url":"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/events/339899295.html"},{"title":"Weekly Community Bingo","category":"Billboard","categoryID":998403,"venue":"Filipino Seniors Group of Winnipeg Cultural Education Centre","url":"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/events/298369446.html"},{"title":"Seniors' Alumni Learning for Life Program","category":"Educational","categoryID":1029566,"venue":"Richardson Centre for Functional Foods and Nutraceuticals","url":"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/events/322879261.html"},{"title":"Canadian Museum for Human Rights ","category":"Educational","categoryID":1029566,"venue":"Canadian Museum for Human Rights","url":"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/events/332559272.html"},{"title":"Mud, Hands, Fire.

Free-flowing -- and often frenetic -- family life requires a home that functions well in every aspect and stands up to myriad demands a family places on it. That means a home's square footage must be generous and its layout exceptionally user-friendly. | However, while function is paramount, that doesn't mean a home should be devoid of style. With that in mind, the design team at Artista Homes set out to create a family-friendly home with an ideal synergy of style and function. | The result is 37 Big Sky Dr., a 1,884 square-foot bungalow situated on an expansive 82-foot by 140-foot lot in Oak Bluff West, said Artista Homes sales representative Jennifer Gulay from Royal LePage Alliance. &quot;This home features a great combination of wow factor and practical features,&quot; she said. &quot;Even though it isn't a huge home by today's standards, it features an efficient floor plan that makes great use of all the available space. Luxurious, creative design touches have also been placed perfectly throughout the home to complement the great layout.&quot; | The efficient floor plan starts the moment you set foot in the foyer. Its exceptional width makes for tons of room to doff shoes and jackets; at the same time, a taupe tile floor makes for a durable, rich-looking entryway. Tucked away neatly to the right is the lower level stairwell; across the way to the left is a set of three steps leading gently upward to an enclosed hallway on the left.","last_updated":"2015-11-07T09:00:00.000Z","full_image_width":1000,"full_image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/1000*651/7311306.jpg"},{"media_type":"Story","allow_comments":"comments","image_height":432,"id":342324131,"author":"Colleen Zacharias","title":"Tips to keep hungry deer out of the garden","last_modified":"2015-11-07T14:51:22.000Z","image_type":"normal","image_width":600,"path":"http://homes.winnipegfreepress.com/winnipeg-real-estate/","dimensions":"600x432","full_image_height":540,"content_type":"WFP Story","related_items":[],"image_title":"White-tailed deer ","our_rating":"","image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/600*432/130115-_STDUP_WEATHER__1630.jpg","image_caption":"With a few simple tricks such as fencing and strategic placement of plants, they can happily co-exist with gardeners.

What do we need to do before we use it, so that we don't burn down the house? Any tips? Peter, Lorette | Answer: Before lighting your first fire, inspect the chimney exterior for broken bricks or crumbling mortar. Shine a light inside the chimney, and be on the lookout for bird nests and cracks. Check to make sure that the damper opens and closes properly. Clean the chimney and loose ashes or contact a professional for seasonal maintenance. Retailers also sell chimney sweeping logs which are designed to reduce and treat creosote buildup. | It is also important to note the wood you burn in your fireplace should be seasoned for at least one year before use. Properly seasoned wood burns hotter and creates less creosote. | Question: I have two flannel-backed vinyl tablecloths.

The tenants have been complaining of cold in the living room, with temperatures of 15 C when the outside temperatures are around -20 C. An inspector visited and identified areas of air leakage in the living room walls, using infrared photo technology. The windows have also lost thermal tightness, as they have not been changed since construction. According to the inspector, the heating system was functioning normally. I discovered the basement beneath the living room was not being heated, and instructed them to do so. Even so, the tenants say they are registering temperatures of 18 C in the basement, 12 C at the living room floor and 16 C in the living room itself. | Is it possible for air leaks and drafty windows to cause an inability for indoor temperature to rise, with a functioning heating system? From what I understand air leaks and drafty windows simply cause the house to be less energy efficient and result in higher heating costs. Should I be looking into inaccurate temperature recordings, or other causes of this problem? | Thank you for any advice you may have regarding this issue. Sincerely, Ling Yuan Kong, Montreal. | ANSWER: Inadequate heat distribution in homes is a common occurrence and is contingent on several factors, not only leaky windows and walls. Maintaining a good comfort level will not only rely on the heating system, but just as much on air-leakage protection and thermal insulation levels. Improving these can be much more cost effective than other solutions and I will try and steer you in the right direction for this fix.","last_updated":"2015-11-07T09:00:00.000Z","full_image_width":1000,"full_image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/1000*1504/7315647.jpg"},{"media_type":"Story","allow_comments":"comments","image_height":432,"id":342322631,"author":"Connie Oliver","title":"Warm tones are hot for upcoming year","last_modified":"2015-11-07T08:03:28.000Z","image_type":"normal","image_width":478,"path":"http://homes.winnipegfreepress.com/winnipeg-real-estate/","dimensions":"478x432","full_image_height":904,"content_type":"WFP Story","related_items":[],"image_title":"7311156","our_rating":"","image":"http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/images/477*432/7311156.jpg","image_caption":"","image_credit":"","cost":27,"image_dimensions":"478x432","section":"Homes","url":"http://homes.winnipegfreepress.com/winnipeg-real-estate-articles/content_id-342322631/","short_title":"","full_image_dimensions":"1000x904","publish_time":"2015-11-07T09:00:00.000Z","source":"wfp-circle","teaser":"According to CIL paint, no matter the temperature outside, Canadian interiors will bask in warmth in 2016.

The inclusion of hues such as moss green, charcoal grey and brown-bag-toned shades, all reminiscent of military fatigues, contribute to the palette's protective

	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<!-- cxenseparse_start -->
			<h4>What is the Winnipeg Free Press’ (FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership, or FPLP) privacy policy?</h4>
<p>FPLP recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about our customers. This includes subscribers to and users of our services, purchasers of our products, advertisers (including those who advertise in classified ads), contest entrants, and visitors to our website. We adhere to fair information practices and limit the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information which is provided to us, to only that information which is necessary for our business purposes, and to provide services to you.</p>
<p>FPLP collects personal information when we provide our services and our products to our customers and to fulfill administrative functions associated with these services, for example to permit billing, delivery of our newspapers and for marketing and other customer relationship purposes. On occasion, we contract with others to provide these services to you and where we engage agents or contract with others to provide those services, we require those agents to demonstrate a similar commitment to maintaining your privacy.</p>
<p>We do not collect, use or disclose personal information about our customers without the consent of our customers, except where disclosure is permitted or required by law.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, FPLP will limit the use of information for the purpose for which it was collected and where we have identified a new use for that information, we will advise you and where reasonable and necessary secure your consent.</p>
<p>FPLP will retain personal information about customers for as long as is necessary for our business purposes and to comply with any applicable laws governing the retention of records.</p>
<p>When FPLP no longer requires the information for our business purposes or to meet those legal requirements, we will either destroy it or render it anonymous.</p>
<!--<h4>Winnipeg Free Press Website</h4>

<h4>Access to Information Procedure</h4>
<p>FPLP, on receipt of a written request by a customer and once that customer has verified that they are entitled to the personal information, will provide an opportunity to review any personal information that FPLP may have about that customer with the exception of any information gathered by its journalists and subject to exceptions set out in Section 9 of PIPEDA.</p>
<p>On receipt of written request and verification of the authority of the person to obtain the personal information, FPLP will make every effort to provide an opportunity for the customer to review the information within 30 days of the written request. If FPLP requires additional time to fulfill that request, the customer will be notified that a further period of time will be required to respond and a follow–up date will be given.</p>
<p>Before providing the information to a customer, FPLP will review that information and remove any sensitive commercial information about FPLP’s business practices and any personal information about identifiable third parties whom have not given consent for the information to be disclosed. If appropriate, the customer will be provided with a copy of the information, at the customer’s expense.</p>
<p>Where a customer believes that the personal information collected by FPLP is inaccurate, the customer may request FPLP make corrections to the personal information. FPLP may make the corrections requested. However, if there is a dispute between FPLP and the customer concerning the accuracy of the personal information collected, FPLP will note on the file that the customer disagrees with that personal information. If any third parties have been provided this information, FPLP will make all reasonable attempts to inform third parties of the correction.</p>
<h4>Personal Information Complaints</h4>
<p>If a customer wants to make a complaint about the manner in which FPLP has used, collected or disclosed personal information the complaint should be directed to the privacy officer. The customer should be assured that the complaint will be investigated and that if necessary the appropriate measures will be taken to correct FPLP’s information handling policies and practices. The complaint should be in writing and sent to 1355 Mountain Avenue, Winnipeg, Manitoba, R2X 3B6.</p>
<h4>Any other questions?</h4>

<p>This Policy may be updated and changed periodically. As changes are made to our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page. You are encouraged to review this page regularly for any changes.</p>
