We anticipate that this policy will change from time to time, and we expressly reserve the right to change the policy when we find it to be appropriate.

This section is asummary of the main features of our privacy policy. The complete statement of our privacy policy is below and is longer and authoritative. We encourage interested users to read the complete policy statement available directly below.

 **Introduction**

 **A.  What this Privacy Policy Covers**

This policy covers customer information gathered by Penton Media, Inc.’s Information Technology Group and its divisions. When we say “we”, we mean “Penton Media, Inc.’s Information Technology Group.” Businesses included in this group include Windows IT Pro, Windows IT Pro Community,SQL Server, System iNetwork, Office and SharePoint Pro, Win Dev Pro, Connected Home, and other Penton Media businesses that link to this policy. Penton Media, Inc. businesses that do not link to this privacy policy are covered by a different privacy policy. Please see the privacy policy link on those sites for their privacy policy.

This policy describes our privacy practices for both online and offline activities including but not limited to our print and digital publications, websites, in-person and online events, email newsletters, and all other products and services of Penton Media, Inc.’s Information Technology Group.  By using any of our websites, you consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information as described in our privacy policy.

The websites covered by this policy, include but are not limited to:

  * Windows IT Pro (windowsitpro.com)
  * SQL Server Magazine (sqlmag.com)  
 
  * Office and SharePoint Pro (officesharepointpro.com)
  * Connected Home Magazine (connectedhomemag.com)

  * Windows SuperSite (winsupersite.com)
  * Win Dev Pro (windevpro.com)
  * System iNetwork (www.systeminetwork.com)
  * Any Penton Media, Inc.’s Information Technology Group website that links to this policy



**B.    General Approach to Privacy**

We are committed to protecting the privacy of all those who provide us with personal information while using our products, websites, events, and services.

At Penton Media, Inc.’s Information Technology Group, our privacy policy is based on Fair Information Practices (FIPs), a set of internationally recognized principles that address the privacy of information about individuals. The principles of FIPs are at the core of many laws and policies addressing privacy and data protection matters. This policy reflects our implementation of FIPs.

This policy is long because addressing privacy in an international business environment is complicated and because Penton Media, Inc.’s Information Technology Group and its divisions have relationships with different categories of individuals, including subscribers, customers, registrants, website visitors, and others. We offer many different products and services on the Internet and otherwise to meet the needs and interests of our customers. Explaining it all takes time and space.

**C.   Safe Harbor Privacy Statement**

For personal information about our customers subject to EU data protection laws that we receive from Member States of the European Union, we have committed to handling such personal information in accordance with the Safe Harbor Principles. Penton Media Inc.’s Information Technology Group’s Safe Harbor certification can be found at <http://web.ita.doc.gov/safeharbor/shlist.nsf/webPages/safe+harbor+list>. Additional information about the Safe Harbor program is available at the U.S. Department of Commerce's website at <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor>.   

We process customer information in our facilities in the United States. All customer information subject to this privacy policy is collected in the United States, obtained through websites in the United States, or obtained in other countries and transferred to the United States. Regardless where it originated, all customer data subject to this policy receives the same level of privacy protection as described in this policy statement.

**D.   Children**

Our websites are not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly solicit data online from, or market online to, children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have obtained personally identifiable information online in error about a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information as soon as we can. We encourage parents to supervise their children so that they do not disclose any personal information about themselves in any of our public discussion areas.

**Openness and Changes to this Policy**

**A.  General** 

This privacy policy describes the processing of most personal information by Penton Media, Inc.’s Information Technology Group and its divisions.   This policy covers personal information about subscribers, customers, registrants, website visitors, and others.

Penton Media, Inc.’s Information Technology Group and its divisions revised its privacy policy in 2007 as part of its certification for the Safe Harbor program. This policy supersedes other privacy policies used by Penton Media, Inc.’s Information Technology Group. While this policy is considerably longer than the policies that it replaces, we did not make any major changes in the way that we process personal information. We still respect the privacy of those whose personal information we process. We still offer opt-outs to our customers and other data subjects, and we still honor requests by those who do not want to hear from us. The new policy includes considerably more detail about how we use and disclose personal information, about the purposes of processing, and about our relationships with other companies we partner with or use to help us carry out our personal information processing.

**B.   Privacy Policy Changes and Updates**

Privacy policies are not static because our activities, products, and use of the Internet are not static. We anticipate that this policy will change from time to time, and we expressly reserve the right to change the policy when we find it to be appropriate. Your continued use of any of our websites constitutes your acceptance of our privacy policy, including any changes.  We do not expect to change our respect for the wishes and the privacy of our customers. However, new laws, other events, new products and services, and changes to our business structure could require change in our policy. We expect that any policy changes will be consistent with Safe Harbor standards and other legal requirements.

When we make changes, we will post them promptly on this website. If possible, we will provide advance notice through the website of the changes, but we do not guarantee that we will always be able to do so. We expect that any changes we make will apply retroactively to personal data collected and maintained prior to the effective date of the change. When we make a change, we will update the date and version number of the privacy policy. We will summarize changes in the Policy History section at the end of the policy. We maintain an archive of superseded policies that we will make available upon request.

**IV.    Information Collection**
