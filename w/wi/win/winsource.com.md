4.1 General

No transmission of data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of the Web Site to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully, including in the case of your contacting us by e-mail or a "contact us" or similar feature on our Website. Accordingly, though the Website may take reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all Personal Information provided to this Web Site, due to the inherent nature of the internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.

4.2 Children

The Website does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13.

4.3 Phishing

Identity theft is a continuing global problem, with unauthorized individuals or companies to send e-mail messages and and other correspondence to consumers, purporting to be a legitimate representative. For example, a bank or online merchant requesting sensitive account or payment information. Although the correspondence may appear to be from the domain and account of a legitimate source, in reality, sometimes it's illegally spoofed in hopes of collecting such sensitive information. This illegal activity is known as "phishing".

If you receive an e-mail correspondence that appears to be from this Website, requesting sensitive Personal Information (such as passwords or credit card information), or that otherwise seems suspicious, do not provide such information and report such a request by using the Website's contact form.
