# Customer Care - Ordering

  
Information Collection and Use  
wine.com by eVineyard, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. wine.com collects information from our users at several different points on our wine.com website. 

You may, from time to time, receive information from us about new features, new services and special offers we think you'll find valuable. Also, from time to time, we may share information with carefully selected business partners. These businesses may use the information we share to provide valuable opportunities and offers to you. If you'd like to opt out of receiving future mailings from wine.com, Inc., follow the procedure outlined in the Choice/Opt-out section below. 

  
Sharing  
wine.com will share aggregated demographic information with its partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

We value your privacy very much at wine.com, and will never release any account information to anyone outside of the necessary core groups that help our business function, like those mentioned above unless our customers give us the authority to do so. 

  
Security  
When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL (Secure Socket Layers), provided by VeriSign, the premier encryption software company available today. While on a secure page such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information offline. All of our users' information, like the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. If one of these people leaves their workstation, they are required to lock their station until they return. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices. 

Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance of keeping our customers' information secure and safe at all times. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a locked and secure environment. 

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to:
