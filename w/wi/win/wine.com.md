### When You Create an Account with Us

Our site's registration form asks you to give us contact information, including your billing address, shipping address, credit card information, and email address. You may supply as much or as little of this information as you like. We use the information provided to facilitate any subsequent orders. We do not make our list of registered customers available to other companies. 

You can update your account information at any time by clicking on [My Account](https://web.archive.org/exec/login) at the top of any page and then following the appropriate links. 

### When You Place an Order

Our order form asks you to give us information specific to that order, including your billing address, shipping address, credit card information and email address. The information that you provide is used to process and send your orders. We also use the information to contact you if there is a problem with your order. We may also use the information to contact you for feedback on our products and services. We do not make our customer list available to other companies. 

### Customer Surveys

We may from time to time conduct surveys that ask you for feedback on our products and services. We use that information to improve our product offerings and identify desirable site and service enhancements. We do not release information from individual survey responses outside wine.com without prior permission. We may occasionally share aggregated data with selected business partners. Some surveys may be performed by outside professional firms on our behalf to minimize bias. Those professionals are bound by these same restrictions. 

After you place an order, the order confirmation page gives you the opportunity to participate in a survey conducted by the BizRate Guide, an independent third party which monitors customer satisfaction with online retailers. BizRate Guide also understands the need to protect the privacy of your responses. The details of BizRate Guide's privacy policy are provided on the actual survey. 

### Our Affiliate Program

Wine.com works with LinkShare Corporation to implement our affiliate program. LinkShare shares our commitment to maintaining the privacy of our web site visitors. In order for us to provide an effective affiliate program, we use LinkShare's services to track visitors from an affiliate site to our own. We do this so we can compensate affiliate sites for referring sales. LinkShare does not record or know the name, phone number or home address of anyone who visits wine.com through its service. 

### Security

All of our transactions automatically take place on a secure server. All of your personal information is encrypted before it is transmitted over the Internet. 

None of our customers has ever reported fraudulent use of a credit card as a result of purchases made at wine.com. In the unlikely event that unauthorized charges appear on your credit card as a result of a secure credit card transaction at wine.com and your credit card provider holds you liable, we will reimburse you for the liability that results from the unauthorized use, up to a maximum of $50.00 US. 

Note: Most banks either cover all the charges that result from unauthorized use of your credit card or limit your liability to $50, the maximum liability allowed under the Fair Credit Billing Act.. You must notify your credit card provider of the unauthorized use in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
