Sharing With Other Companies 

Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. may provide personally identifiable information to outside vendors for analysis, verification, revision, consolidation or storage, but only to enable Winn-Dixie to use the information more effectively in serving its customers. We may also provide this information to regulatory, law enforcement or other governmental entities upon proper request. Under an appropriate contract, Winn-Dixie may make personally identifiable information available to a third party so the third party may join with or assist Winn-Dixie in providing promotions or services to our customers. In any case, Winn-Dixie does not make personally identifiable information available to a third party (other than a governmental entity) unless it has entered into a contract with Winn-Dixie that requires it to maintain security procedures to prevent unauthorized access to the information.

It is not unusual for companies to consolidate their operations in new corporate structures, to merge with other corporations, or to transfer ownership of a business unit so that it can continue to function under a new owner. Winn-Dixie pledges that it will never transfer your personally identifiable information to such a new owner or corporate entity except under a contract that requires the new owner or entity to continue to abide by our promises to you above. Winn-Dixie is not obligated to observe the above restrictions when providing non-personally identifiable compilations of information to third parties.
