</p><p>WindowsMedia.com may share aggregate information with other Microsoft websites and services, such as anonymous visitor statistics.
</p><p>WindowsMedia.com does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.  We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as providing customer support or performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service.  They are required to maintain the confidentiality of that information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
</p><p>WindowsMedia.com websites may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Microsoft or the website; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Microsoft, WindowsMedia.com or an MSN website; or (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Microsoft, its websites, or the public.

A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
</p><p>A cookie will be sent to WindowsMedia.com whenever its services are accessed.

</p><p><a name="list6"></a><span class="month" style="COLOR:#000000">The Use of Third Party Ad Networks</span><br>
The majority of the online banner advertisements you see on WindowsMedia.com websites are displayed by MSN. Because of this, MSN may also place cookies on your computer. In addition, WindowsMedia.com and MSN allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on WindowsMedia.com websites. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer in order to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. WindowsMedia.com does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks. 
<br>MSN maintains relationships with a number of the third-party ad networks currently operating such as: 24/7 Real Media; AdForce; AdKnowledge; AppNet/admaximize/i33; Avenue A; BlueStreak.com; CFM&amp;Z; Click Here; DoubleClick; Flycast; Interad Network; MatchLogic; Mediaplex; Sabela Media; The Thinking Media; and Vita Bella.
