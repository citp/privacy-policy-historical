If you would like us to remove you from our Do Not Call List in order to receive our telephone solicitations, notify us by contacting us at the above address or telephone number. 

Please note that Windows-Price’s Do Not Call Policy does not cover independent third parties, so you may continue to receive calls from other companies. If you would like to add your number to the National Do Not Call List, you may do so by calling 1-888-382-1222, or visiting www.donotcall.gov. 

Also note that being on the Windows-Price’s Do Not Call List restricts telephone solicitations only. We may still contact you about other topics.
