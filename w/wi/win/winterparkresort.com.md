### Intrawest Privacy Policy

Intrawest is committed to the privacy of our customers and guests (“you” and “your”). The Intrawest Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) applies to Personal Information that Intrawest collects, whether online, in person, through our call centers or otherwise.

**“** **Intrawest”, “we”, “us” or “our” refers to** Intrawest Resorts Holdings, Inc., its subsidiaries and certain of its affiliates. Intrawest has an international presence and maintains offices and facilities in multiple jurisdictions throughout the United States and Canada. Except in circumstances where the privacy policy of an affiliate or partner applies, all of Intrawest’s business operations are subject to this policy.

This Policy does not apply to information about Intrawest’s employees or to information that is not Personal Information.

  * We collect your personal information when you purchase a product or service or enroll in a program 



When you purchase a product or service, make a reservation or enroll in a program, we collect personal information in order to process the transaction and administer the program.  We may also send you information relating to your purchase, reservation or program.  For example, if you make a reservation at one of our resort locations, we may send you information about the activities, events or offers taking place at that resort.  The information we may collect and use for these purposes includes but is not limited to:

  * payment card information to process transactions 
  * age and/or birth date, gender and biometric data (such as height, weight) where this information is necessary in connection with the product, service, program or activity that you have requested (for example, we may need gender, height and weight to provide you with appropriate rental equipment) 
  * photograph to identify you as a guest 
  * whether you’re the parent or guardian of a minor guest 
  * information about your preferences (such as preferred lodging room type).

When you purchase or use Intrawest pass products and tickets, we may collect information regarding your geographic location, activities and purchases while you are at Intrawest resorts.  Intrawest pass products and tickets use either handheld scanner or RFID (radio frequency identification) technology.  Through the use of this technology, Intrawest may be able to collect information regarding your location at the resort, including the lifts that you ride, and depending on whether you have a payment card linked to your pass product, other commercial transactions that you complete at an Intrawest retail or restaurant location. We use this information to understand how our guests use our resorts and to understand your personal preferences.  Depending on your marketing preferences, we may also use this information to send you personalized offers and invitations.

Depending on your marketing preferences, we may also use this information to send you offers, invitations or promotions relating to our locations, products, services or programs that we believe may be of interest to you.  For example, we may monitor your commercial transactions or browsing habits on our websites or at our resort locations which may influence the personalized special offers and promotions that we send to you.

Several of our resorts use GPS tracking technology in connection with their ski and ride school programs in order to track and locate students on the mountain.  The GPS tracking technology is owned and operated by a third party service provider which may be provided certain information to operate websites on which you and/or your family members can track your day on the mountain. 

At certain of our resort locations we may use video surveillance for the safety and security of our guests, employees and property. We will retain video recordings for as long as reasonably necessary for these purposes. 

  * We collect your personal information from third parties
