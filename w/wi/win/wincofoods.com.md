# Privacy Policy | WinCo Foods

Effective Date: Dec. 9, 2011

At WinCo Foods, we are very sensitive to the privacy concerns of visitors to all of our websites, including our pages and applications on third-party social-networking services such as Facebook or Twitter and our applications on mobile devices. This Privacy Policy explains our online information practices at this website and the choices that you, as a visitor to this website, can make about the collection and use of your information.

**Personal information we may ask you for and how we might use it**  
When you visit our website, we may request personal information from you (such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, etc.) and only if you voluntarily provide it to us. Depending on the purpose for which the information was provided, we may use the information to communicate with you regarding our products, services, and promotions, to provide you with other information or materials that you request, to customize your interactive experience, and/or to improve our product and service offerings.

Here are the circumstances in which we might ask for personal information from our consumers though our website, the types of information we obtain, and how we might use the information:

  * If you contact one of our Consumer Services Representatives through our website, we may ask you for personal information such as your name, address, phone number, or e-mail address so that we can respond to your questions or comments. (Of course, if you send us an e-mail, we will at a minimum obtain your e-mail address.)
  * You may be asked to provide personal information if you:
    * register as a user of our website or post content to our website;
    * agree or ask to receive an online newsletter or other information or material from us;
    * register for a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion;
    * register to receive coupons through our website;
    * participate in a survey, a consumer research panel, or similar type of activity; or
    * otherwise participate in features of our website that ask for personal information.



Your participation in any of these activities is entirely voluntary. We may use the information you provide to respond to your questions or comments, to administer our promotions and websites, to fulfill your request, subscription, or order, to provide you with a customized interactive experience, or to otherwise provide or improve our products and services. Based on the information you provide, we also may obtain additional information about you, such as U.S. Postal Service address change data or demographic information, from commercially available sources.

We will not send you any online newsletter or similar e-mail communication unless you expressly consent to receive such a communication from us. And if you do choose to receive any such e-mail communication from us, you will always have the opportunity to “unsubscribe” from receiving the e-mail at any time.

**How do we use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies?**  
We may employ cookie technology, web beacons, transparent GIF images, and similar devices to facilitate website administration and navigation and to provide an enhanced online experience for our visitors. Information tracked through these mechanisms includes but is not limited to (1) a user’s IP address (2) the type of web browser and operating system being used, (3) the pages of the website a user visits, and (4) other websites a user visited before visiting our website. These devices may also be used on our behalf by third parties managing our advertising on other websites to enable us to learn which advertisements bring visitors to our websites and to otherwise improve our online advertising.

Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to do so or to notify the user when a cookie is being sent. If you wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies. Please note that if you disable cookies, you may be unable to access some customized features on our website.

Devices like web beacons and transparent GIF images are tiny or transparent graphics that allow us to count the number of users who have visited a particular web page or to access certain cookies. We may use these graphics on our websites to count users and to recognize users by accessing our cookies. Being able to access our cookies allows us to personalize our website and improve your experience at our website. We may also include these graphics in HTML-formatted e-mail messages that we send to determine which e-mail messages were opened.

**When we might provide other parties with your personal information**  
Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, WinCo Foods will not share your personal information with other unaffiliated companies.

We may provide your personal information to third parties who provide services on our behalf. These parties may use the information solely in conjunction with the specific services they provide for us (e.g., fulfillment of an order, responding to your question or comment, providing a sweepstakes prize, deployment of a consumer survey, investigation of a complaint, etc.).

Some of these third parties may be involved in administering or supplementing our databases and will need to have access to the information in order to do so.

WinCo will not transfer or sell any information except in the event of a sale of of our business or assets to a third party. We also reserve the right to share information within WinCo Foods among our various businesses.

We reserve the right to disclose any personal information as needed if such information is requested by law enforcement agencies or if we are required to do so by law, regulation, subpoena, court order, or by a government entity.
