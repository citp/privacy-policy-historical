# WINThrills Network - Privacy Policy

We take your privacy very seriously. Please read this privacy policy carefully as it contains important information on who we are and how and why we collect, store, use and share your personal information. It also explains your rights in relation to your personal information and how to contact us or supervisory authorities in the event you have a complaint. 

We collect, use and are responsible for certain personal information about you. When we do so we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation, which applies across the European Union (including in the United Kingdom) and we are responsible as ‘controller’ of that personal information for the purposes of those laws.

We may collect and use the following personal information about you:

  * your name and contact information, including email address and telephone number

How your personal information is collected

We collect most of this personal information directly from you—in person, by telephone, text or email and/or via our website forms online. However, we may also collect information:

  * from publicly accessible sources, eg Companies House or HM Land Registry;
  * directly from a third party, eg:


  1. sanctions screening providers;

  3. customer due diligence providers;
  4. marketing agencies and lead generation companies


  * from a third party with your consent, e.g. sub agency, lawyers, business associates
  * from cookies on our website — for more information on our use of cookies, please see our cookies policy
  * via our IT systems, eg:


  1. door entry systems and reception logs;
  2. automated monitoring of our websites and other technical systems, such as our computer networks and connections, CCTV and access control systems, communications systems, email and instant messaging systems;



How and why we use your personal information

Under data protection law, we can only use your personal information if we have a proper reason for doing so, eg:

  * to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations;
  * for the performance of our contract with you or to take steps at your request before entering into a contract;
  * for our legitimate interests or those of a third party; or
  * where you have given consent



A legitimate interest is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information, so long as this is not overridden by your own rights and interests. 

Promotional communications

We may use your personal information to send you updates (by email, text message, telephone or post) about our products AND/OR services, including exclusive offers, promotions or new products AND/OR services.

We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal information for promotional purposes (see above ‘How and why we use your personal information’). This means we do not usually need your consent to send you promotional communications. However, where consent is needed, we will ask for this consent separately and clearly.

We will always treat your personal information with the utmost respect and never sell OR share it with other organisations save for completion of a investment on your behalf

You have the right to opt out of receiving promotional communications at any time by:
