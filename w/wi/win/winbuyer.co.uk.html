																		This Privacy Policy covers the use of the website www.WinBuyer.com and the <b>"Win 
																			Buyer Shopping Messenger"</b> software and comparative service provided 
																		therein (collectively: <b>"Win Buyer Shopping Messenger"</b>), which are owned 
																		by Win Buyer Ltd. At Win Buyer, we're committed to your privacy and your 
																		privacy is safe with us. Our Privacy Policy is simple:
																		<br>
																		<br>
																		<p><strong>What do we do?</strong></p>
																		<ul>
																			<li>
																				When you visit a recognized shopping website, the <b>Win Buyer Shopping Messenger</b>
																			software connects to our servers to check for product information, better 
																			prices and alternative offers for the product you were interested in, in order 
																			to present them to you.
																			</li><li>
																				The sites on which <b>Win Buyer Shopping Messenger</b>
																			operates are only sites which we have examined and approved as safe for the 
																			user, and the software maintains a regularly-updated "white list" of such 
																			sites. The software does not track or transmit any data when you visit sites 
																			which are not on that "white list".
																			</li><li>
																			The software transmits to our servers only the URL of the e-commerce site you 
																			are visiting or the search term you typed in on these e-commerce sites. In some 
																			of the pages our software also transmits data about the products information 
																			presented on the page, in order to provide you with related information and 
																			comparative offers.
																			</li><li>
																				We offer you comparative product, as well as additional product information, 
																				from trusted vendors on the net.
																			</li>
																		</ul>
																		<p><br>
																			<strong>What we don't do:</strong></p>
																		<ul>
																			<li>
																			We do not collect any personally identifiable information ("PII") about you.
																			</li><li>
																			We do not trade, rent or sell PII to third parties. We do not disclose the URLs 
																			visited by you to anybody else.
																			</li><li>
																			We do not transmit to our servers any information about your searches or 
																			website visits, except for information about visits to e-commerce sites, and 
																			searches performed on such sites. When such information is transmitted to our 
																			servers, it is processed only for the purpose of performing the comparative 
																			service.
																			</li><li>
																				We do not display popup on your computer.
																			</li>
																		</ul>
																		<p>
																			<b>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</b></p>
																		<p>(a)Anonymous Aggregate Information<br>
																			<b>Win Buyer Shopping Messenger</b> collects and stores aggregated anonymous 
																			information about the e-commerce web pages its users view and the data they 
																			enter in search engine search fields while using the <b>Win Buyer Shopping 
																				Messenger</b> software (the "Service"). <b>Win Buyer Shopping Messenger</b> 
																			uses this information to determine which alternative offers and additional 
																			product information to display on your message box. The <b>Win Buyer Shopping 
																				Messenger</b> software does not send to our servers any information about 
																			the web pages you view unless you are visiting one of the e-commerce sites that 
																			we have examined. For every such e-commerce web page you view while using the 
																			Service, the <b>Win Buyer Shopping Messenger</b> software transmits from your 
																			computer to the <b>Win Buyer Shopping Messenger</b> server and stores the 
																			following information: your Internet Protocol (IP) Address; the Full Uniform 
																			Resource Locator (URL) of the web page you are visiting. We also collect and 
																			store the following <b>Win Buyer Shopping Messenger</b> box for statistics and 
																			accounting purposes: what is clicked on the browser window pane; which keyword 
																			searches are performed within the application search box and what alternative 
																			results are received during any given session.
																			<br>

																			<br>
																			(b)Personally Identifiable Information<br>

																			personal information

																			search terms collected from users to build anonymous web usage trends.

																			<b>Win Buyer Shopping Messenger</b> does not:
																		</p>
																		<p>(a) Associate or store non-personally identifiable web usage data or search 
																			information with any PII;
																			<br>
																			<br>
																			(b) Analyze such web usage data or search information to determine the identity 
																			of any <b>Win Buyer Shopping Messenger</b> user; or

																				Buyer Shopping Messenger</b> box.
