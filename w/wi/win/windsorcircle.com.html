<p>Windsor Circle’s accountability for personal data that it receives under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Windsor Circle remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Windsor Circle proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.&nbsp;</p>
