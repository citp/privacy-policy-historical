<p><strong>1.1</strong> Intrawest designates the Chief Privacy Officer as the person accountable for compliance with the Policy. From time to time, the Chief Privacy Officer is entitled to delegate day-to-day responsibility for administration of this Privacy Policy and related privacy policies and practices to other employees and consultants.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intrawest shall identify and document the purposes for which personal information is collected at or before the time the personal information is collected or, when appropriate, at or before the time the personal information is used for a new purpose.</p>
<p><strong>2.1</strong> Intrawest collects personal information for the following purposes:</p>
<p>a) to establish and maintain a responsible commercial relationship with customers;</p>

<hr size="100">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="3" name="3">Principle 3 - Consent</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The knowledge and consent of an individual are generally required for the collection, use or disclosure of personal information. In certain circumstances personal information can be collected, used or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the individual, such as in the case of an emergency where the life, health or security of an individual is threatened.</p>
<p>Intrawest may disclose personal information without knowledge or consent to a lawyer or other advisor representing Intrawest, to collect a debt, to comply with a subpoena, warrant or other court order, or as may be otherwise required or authorized by law.</p>
<p><strong>3.1</strong> In obtaining consent, Intrawest shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that an individual is advised of the identified purposes for which personal information will be used or disclosed. Purposes shall be stated in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the individual.</p>
<p><strong>3.2</strong> Generally, Intrawest shall seek consent to use and disclose personal information at the same time it collects the information. However, Intrawest may seek consent to use and disclose personal information after it has been collected, but before it is used or disclosed for a new purpose.</p>
<p><strong>3.3</strong> Intrawest will require individuals to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information as a condition of the supply of a product or service only if such collection, use or disclosure is reasonably required to fulfill the identified purposes.</p>
<p><strong>3.4</strong> In determining the appropriate form of consent, Intrawest shall take into account the sensitivity of the personal information and the reasonable expectations of an individual.</p>
<p><strong>3.5</strong> Where consent is required for a particular use or disclosure, an individual may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. Individuals may contact Intrawest for more i-ion regarding the implications of withdrawing consent. </p>

<p><strong>4.1</strong> Intrawest collects personal information primarily from the individual to whom the information relates.</p>
<p><strong>4.2</strong> Intrawest may also collect personal information from other sources including credit bureaus or other third parties who represent that they have the right to disclose the information, or as otherwise permitted by law.</p>

<h2><a id="5" name="5">Principle 5 - Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention of Personal Information</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intrawest shall not use or disclose personal information for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as required by law. Intrawest shall retain personal information only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes or as required or permitted by law.</p>
<p><strong>5.1</strong> Intrawest may disclose an individual's personal information to:</p>
<p>a) a person who in the reasonable judgment of Intrawest is seeking the information as an agent of the individual;</p>
<p>b) a company or individual employed by Intrawest to perform functions on its behalf, such as but not limited to research or data processing;</p>
<p>c) another company or individual for the development, enhancement, marketing or provision of any of Intrawest's products and services;</p>
<p>d) an agent used by Intrawest to evaluate the individual's creditworthiness or to collect the individual's account;</p>
<p>e) a credit reporting agency;</p>
<p>f) a public authority or agent of a public authority, if in the reasonable judgment of Intrawest, it appears that there is imminent danger to life or property which could be avoided or minimized by disclosure of the information;</p>
<p>g) another entity as part of a merger, a sale of assets or all or part of a business, or any other corporate change or re-organization;</p>
<p>h) a third party or parties, where the individual consents to such disclosure or disclosure is required or permitted by law.</p>
<p><strong>5.2</strong> Only Intrawest employees with a business need to know, or whose duties reasonably so require, are granted access to personal information about individuals.
</p>
<p><strong>5.3</strong> Depending on the circumstances, where personal information has been used to make a decision about an individual, Intrawest shall retain, for a reasonable period of time, either the actual information or the rationale for making the decision.
</p>
<p><strong>5.4</strong> Intrawest shall maintain reasonable and systematic controls, schedules and practices for information and records retention and destruction which apply to personal information that is no longer necessary or relevant for the identified purposes or required or permitted by law to be retained. Such information shall be destroyed, erased or made anonymous.
</p>
<p><strong>5.5</strong> Where appropriate, Intrawest may communicate updates of personal information to third parties.</p>
<p><strong>5.6</strong> Intrawest may engage affiliates or third party service providers for the purpose of providing services or processing information on behalf of Intrawest, and we may transfer or disclose personal information to such parties in connection with such purposes. Some divisions, affiliates or third party service providers may be located in other jurisdictions, and information in their custody (i) may or may not be subject to privacy legislation similar to that applicable to Intrawest, and (ii) may be subject to laws applicable in such jurisdictions that permit access to such information by foreign governments or law enforcement agencies or by others.</p>

<h2><a id="6" name="6">Principle 6 - Accuracy</a></h2>

<h2><a id="9" name="9">Principle 9 - Individual Access</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="10" name="10"></a>
<p>Upon request, Intrawest shall inform an individual of the existence, use and disclosure of his or her personal information, at a minimal or no cost to the individual. An individual shall be able to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information and have it amended as appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>9.1</strong> In certain situations, Intrawest may not be able to provide access to all the personal information that it holds about an individual. For example, Intrawest may not provide access to information if doing so would likely reveal personal information about a third party or could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of an individual. Also, Intrawest may not provide access to information if disclosure would reveal confidential commercial information, if the information is protected by solicitor-client privilege, if the information was generated in the course of a formal dispute resolution process, or if the information was collected in relation to the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a law. If access to personal information cannot be provided, Intrawest shall, upon request, provide the reasons for denying access. </p>
<p><strong>9.2</strong> In order to safeguard personal information, an individual may be required to provide sufficient identification information to permit Intrawest to authorize access to the individual's file. </p>
<p><strong>9.3</strong> Individuals can seek access to their personal information by contacting the Privacy Office at Intrawest. </p>
<p><strong>9.4</strong> Intrawest will endeavor to respond to all requests within 30 days or, in any event, as required or permitted by applicable law. </p>
