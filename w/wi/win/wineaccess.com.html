		<div id="priv_body">WineAccess is committed to protecting your privacy. You are important to us, and we will take special care to maintain your trust. In order to fully understand your rights, we encourage you to read this Privacy Statement and to consult our <a href="legal-notices.tcl">Terms of Use</a> page. Please direct questions regarding this statement to <a href="mailto:wacs@wineaccess.com">wacs@wineaccess.com</a>.

		<p><b>Our Privacy Policy addresses the following questions:</b><br>

		</p><ul>
		<li><a href="#collect">When does WineAccess collect my personal information?</a>
		</li><li><a href="#used">How is my personal information used?</a></li>

		<p></p><div class="help_topic_head_first"><a name="collect"></a><b>When does WineAccess collect my personal information?</b></div>

		<div style="privacy_body">WineAccess gathers information from members and visitors in four ways: voluntary registration/email sign up, member submissions (such as ratings, reviews, purchasing requests), cookie technology and IP addresses.
		<p><b>Registration/Email Sign Up</b><br>When you register as a member of WineAccess or sign up to receive our email offers, we collect information that helps us identify you. The more information you provide, the better we can customize our services and your experience to suit your needs and preferences. Upon signing up for our email offers, we ask for your email address and zip code only. At the initial registration screen we ask for your name, alias, zip code, country, email address and password ("Account Information.") On occasion, we may also collect additional personal information if you choose to enter a contest or complete a survey form.
		</p><p>When you order from us, we also ask for your name, shipping address, telephone number, and your credit card number, billing address, and expiration date (your "Order Information."). If you have chosen to receive our email offers and change your mind, visit the "Contact Info" page within the "My WineAccess" section of the site to change your preferences. (Whenever you decide to change your preferences, please make sure to change your preferences for each account or e-mail address you have with us.) 

		</p><p><b>Reviews</b><br>When you submit reviews about products or services, and when you participate in contests and members surveys, the information you provide may become public on the WineAccess web site, including its partner's pages (e.g., wine retailers, wineries and wine experts.)</p>

		<p><b>Cookies</b><br>

		We use cookies to store and track your preferences to provide you with a more personalized member experience. A cookie is a message sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Most Internet sites use cookies. You can set your browser preferences to reject all cookies, but this will prevent you from using most customized services, and you may have to repeatedly enter personal information in order to participate in various services or promotions. Cookies make your experience easier by saving your preferences and passwords. We also use cookies that contain no personal information at all. These cookies help us estimate our audience size, determine which areas of the WineAccess Web site are the most popular, and serve targeted content. </p>

		<p><b>IP Address</b><br>

		We may log IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration, or to report information in aggregate form to our retail partners and advertisers (e.g., how many visitors logged in to our Web Site) in a form that is not personally identifiable. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer automatically when you use the Internet. When you visit a particular Web page in the WineAccess Web site, our servers log your IP address.</p>

		<div class="privacy_topic_head"><a name="used"></a><b>How is my personal information used?</b></div>

		<div style="privacy_body"><b>Customized Look and Feel</b><br>WineAccess gathers member information to provide you with an effortless member experience. For instance, your personal information enables us to greet you when you return to our site and to provide you with specific information, such as the wines in your portfolio, as well as services we think will be of interest to you. We review our members' preferences, demographics, traffic patterns, and other information - as a whole - so that we can better understand who our audience is and what it wants.<p><b>Banner Advertising</b><br>

		Tracking member preferences also helps us serve targeted advertising. Targeted ads are probably more interesting to you and are more productive for our advertisers. Please note that we do not share your personal information with advertisers. We, or third-party ad servers acting on our behalf, act as the middleman between you and the advertisers that want to reach you. Our third-party ad servers may have access to your personal information, but are bound by the terms of this Privacy Statement.</p>

		<p><b>E-mail</b><br>

		If you register or sign up with our site, from time to time we may e-mail you with informative messages about our products that may be of interest to you. We will not send you third party mailings unless you check the appropriate box when you register. If you elect to receive such offers when you register, you may update your profile at any time afterwards to discontinue such mailings. To update your member profile and/or opt in/out of receiving offers and mailings, please visit the "Contact Info" page within the "My WineAccess" section of the site.

		<p style="font-size: 11px;"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

		<div class="privacy_topic_head"><a name="share"></a><b>Who does WineAccess share information with?</b></div>

		<div style="privacy_body">We may share member information in order to provide you with a more integrated and customized member experience. We will not disclose your personal information to third parties, except to the extent necessary to provide you with a requested service, or under circumstances required by law. We will disclose your personal information when we believe in good faith that any applicable law, regulation, or legal process requires it, or where we believe disclosure is necessary to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of another member. We also disclose aggregated member statistics in order to describe our services and audience to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties. However aggregate data is not traceable to you specifically.

		<p>Specific uses of personal information that vary from this Privacy Statement (if any) may be found in the <a href="/static/legal-notices.tcl">Terms of Use</a> or privacy policies applicable to that particular service. To the extent that you are notified of uses of your personal information which are different from those described in this Privacy Statement during your enrollment in any particular service, contest or promotion, the uses of which you are specifically notified will govern that service, sweepstakes, contest or promotion. Please be on the look-out for terms of service and privacy statements that apply to the services for which you enroll or participate in. Note, however, that we do not control the privacy policies of our advertisers and other third party sites to which we provide banner ads and links. If you click-through a banner ad or link to and submit your information to an advertiser, you will be subject to their own privacy policies. We assume no responsibility or liability for these third party policies or the actions of non-affiliated third parties.</p>

		<div class="privacy_topic_head"><a name="control"></a><b>What are my options to control the use of my personal information?</b></div>

		<div style="privacy_body">

		Most browsers can be configured to reject cookies or alert you when cookies are being sent. You may cancel your registration to WineAccess and/or request the removal of your personal information from our member records by sending e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@wineaccess.com">privacypolicy@wineaccess.com</a>. We will send an email to confirm your request. After you respond, we will remove your information from our database. Residual information may remain in our archives and records, but this information will not be used for a commercial purpose (however we may notify you of major changes to our service from time to time). We reserve the right to maintain information on registered members who have violated our <a href="/static/legal-notices.tcl">Terms of Use</a> or who have had their access to WineAccess blocked in order to detect repeat offenders.

		<p style="font-size: 11px;"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

		<div class="privacy_topic_head"><a name="know"></a><b>What else should I know about my privacy?</b></div>

		<div style="privacy_body">You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personal information on-line in a public area, that information might be collected and used by others. We do not control the actions of our visitors and registered members. If you disclose personal information in a review, Message Board posting, or any other publicly accessible place on the WineAccess site, you do so at your own risk and you understand that your information may be collected and used by others to send you unsolicited messages, advertisements, or for other purposes.

		<p>Please remember that protection of your privacy begins with you . You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any password you use to register, and you should always be careful and responsible whenever disclosing information online.</p>

		<p>This Web Site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. When you place orders or access your account information, we use a secure server.  The secure server layer (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. All of the customer data we collect is similarly protected against unauthorized access. </p>

		<p>WineAccess will not share your personal information with third parties unless you have consented to the disclosure or the disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process, (2) protect and defend our rights and property, (3) protect our customers or users from misuse or unauthorized use of the WineAccess Web Site, or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our customers or the public.</p>

		<p><b> Links to Other Web Sites </b> <br>

		The WineAccess Web Sites contain links to other sites, operated by third parties, that we think may be of interest to you.  WineAccess encourages third parties to follow appropriate privacy standards and policies, but is not responsible for the actions of those third parties, the content of their web sites, or any practices they may follow.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 11px;"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

		<div class="privacy_topic_head"><a name="acceptance"></a><b>How do I accept this Privacy Policy?</b></div>

		<div style="privacy_body">By using the WineAccess site and services, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Statement. If you do not agree or are not comfortable with any policy described in this Privacy Statement, your only remedy is to discontinue use of the WineAccess site. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Statement at any time. Your continued use of any portion of the WineAccess site following notification or posting of such changes, will constitute your acceptance of those changes. If you have questions or concerns about our specific policies, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@wineaccess.com">privacypolicy@wineaccess.com</a>.

		<p><b> Use By Minors </b> <br>

		WineAccess's sites are for adults of legal age in the states or territories where they reside and usage by minors is not intended.  That said, the safety of children is very important to us.  Children, particularly those under the age of 13, should always ask parents or guardians for permission before sending personal information to WineAccess or to anyone contacted through our websites.</p>
