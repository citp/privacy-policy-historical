Effective immediately, your Wings Visa debit and/or credit cards are enrolled in Visa® Account Updater. This program is designed to limit payment interruptions by updating card-on-file account information with merchants/third parties; this includes recurring billing payments. The information updates include billing address changes, new account numbers and updated expiration dates. When you choose to store your account information with these merchants/third parties, you acknowledge that we may share updates of this information with these merchants/third parties.

Wings is required to provide updates to this information to participating merchants/third parties that you have elected to store your Wings Visa debit and/or credit card account information with unless you request that such information no longer be shared. You may make this request by calling 1 800 692-2274, option 4. Please note that not all merchants participate in this program. It is still your responsibility to provide your updated account information with merchants/third parties as your information changes.
