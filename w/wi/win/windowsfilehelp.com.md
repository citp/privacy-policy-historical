#### Information Collection

When you purchase, download trial or evaluation versions, or register WinMaximizer software, we may collect personal information including your name, address, email address, etc. for the purpose of recording the transaction when you engage in activities on our web site or within the WinMaximizer software.

We also give users the option of receiving useful product information (such as updates, pest alerts and associated product offerings), via opt-in permission based email. We fully ensure your privacy and value your trust. We will never sell, rent, lease, or give your information to a third party unless required to do so by law. You may opt out of receiving emails from us at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email or by visiting our website at www.WinMaximizer.com. By choosing to enter and submit the requested information when prompted, you are consenting to Celeritas Software Company's collection, use, and disclosure of such information for the purposes as outlined herein.
