We do not intend to collect personal information from you, however, we ask you to keep in mind that if you voluntarily disclose personal information online – for example, in a forum or chat room made available through the Website – that information can be viewed and used by others. We are not responsible for unsolicited messages you receive from other users. We encourage you to exercise caution when making decisions about what information you disclose in such public areas. Furthermore, except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, any information you transmit or post may be used by us for any purpose. You may also be asked to provide your name, address or credit card information in connection with your use of the Website (including, without limitation, by your submission of purchase orders). 

You may have certain rights under the Communications Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, and other state and federal statutes that may apply, and by accepting these terms and using the Website, you are waiving all of these rights as to collection, use, disclosure and storage of your personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information collected by us.

Certain non-personally identifiable information about our visitors is collected by the standard operation of our Internet servers and through the use of “cookies” (small amounts of data that are sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with the Website technology, such as the type of Internet browser you are using and the domain name of your internet service provider, where you go within the website and how much time you spend in any particular area, search queries, impressions and other data).
