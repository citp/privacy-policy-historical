# WinsPark - Privacy and Security Policy

As an operator based in the EU, Hermione is GDPR compliant and entirely committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.  

This Privacy Policy outlines our practices with respect to collecting, using and disclosing the Private Information we gather through your use of our services and website, and relays the rights of individuals in relation to the personal data we hold.

The Privacy Policy is a part of our Terms of Service and is incorporated therein by reference. It is likewise an integral part of Winspark User Agreement. Accordingly, when you access or use the Winspark website, you automatically agree to our collection, use, and disclosure of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

**We collect your information in order to:**

  * Comply with our regulatory duties, obligations and responsibilities. 
  * Conform to legal requirements or comply with legal processes under any valid and applicable legislation and/or competent authority (meaning any authority having any governmental, juridical or regulatory jurisdiction over us).
  * For the purpose of reporting  potential or suspected crime, including money laundering or  fraud. 



If you do not agree, or are not comfortable with any part of this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Winspark website and services.

According to the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Winspark commits to taking the following customer’s rights into consideration:

**Breach Notification**

Where a data breach is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the Company is obliged to inform all customers within 72 hours of first having become aware of such a breach.

**Right to Access**

Winspark’s clients have the right to know whether or not personal data is being processed, where, and for what purpose. For more detailed information, customers can check the following sections of the privacy Policy (below): 

**  \- The type of information we collect **  
 **  \- How we collect information?**  
 **  \- How we use the information we collect **  
 **  \- With whom we share the information**  
 **  \- Retention of Personal Information**

Upon request, we will provide our customers with a copy of the collected personal data in an electronic format. 

**Right to be Forgotten  **

Winspark’s clients have the right to request their personal data to be erased and cease the further dissemination of their data by the Company or any third parties. It should also be taken into consideration that this right requires the Company to compare the individual’s rights to the “public interest in the availability of the data” when regarding such requests. 

**Data Portability  **

Winspark’s customers have the right to request their previously provided personal data. Data portability allows customers to use this data with other operators as well.

**The type of information we collect  **

**We collect two types of information from our users:  **

**1\. Non-personal Information**  \- the first type of information is unidentified and non-identifiable information pertaining to a user, which may be made available or gathered via your use of our services . User’s Non-Personal information includes, Inter alia, IP address, ISP and operating system types, internet browsers and dates, as well as times our service is accessed.   
 **2\. Personal Information**  \- the second type of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual. When you use our Services, you will be asked to provide Personal Information. User’s personal information includes, Inter alia, User’s name, address, phone number, e-mail address, credit card number and financial information. 

If we combine Personal Information with Non-Personal Information, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.  

**How we collect information  **

We collect all the Account Information that you provide us with during the Account creation process and your personal information when you register to become a member of our site or voluntarily provide when you use the site / communicate with us. In order to offer the best possible service and to minimise any risk of unfairness, we keep records of your gaming history and financial transactions history. We also collect information when certain changes in a customer’s account are applied upon a customer’s wish, such as changes in email address, registration of a new payment method, etc.  

**Cookies  **

We use cookies (a piece of data sent from a website and stored in a user's web browser while the user is browsing that website) to track your use in Winspark, provide you with a more personalized user experience, and allow you to sign in and begin playing instantly when visiting the website.

You may remove the cookies by following the instructions of your device preferences. You may also find more information about cookies here. Note, however, that if you choose to disable cookies, some features of our service may not operate properly and your online experience may be compromised as a result.

**How we use the information we collect    **

We use and share Personal Information in the manners described in this Privacy Policy. The Personal Information will be disclosed to a third-party only to the extent required for the specific purpose, as stipulated in this Privacy Policy, and in such a case, we require the relevant third-party to agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy. 

We use the collected personal details and information only for its intended purpose, such as; allowing us to communicate and send you your Withdrawals. We may also contact you via email to provide you with information regarding new software updates, terms & conditions updates, policies, and promotional material.

We may use the personal information that you provided to set up your account and provide you with the services (including billing), and to administer and manage your account and provide you with promotional updates regarding such products or services.   

We will not send you unsolicited information regarding any third-party commercial offers or advertisements.

**With whom we share the information?**

We do not rent, sell, or share your Personal Information with third parties  except as described in this Privacy Policy. The Personal Information will be disclosed to Recipients only to the extent required for the specific purpose, as stipulated in this Privacy Policy.

We may occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including, without limitation, identity verification and authentication; payment processing; communication of promotional material; information relating to our and our partners’ products and services, and the provision of software. We will only provide these companies with information that is reasonably required to perform the service, and they will be prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. When any of our third-party contractors or partners collect and/or have access to your personal information, we require that they adhere to our stated Privacy policies and protect the confidentiality of your personal information.

**Transfer of information  **

Winspark is SSL-Secured. When your (Personal and Non-Personal) Information passes from your computer to our server, we ensure that your personal information and all other sensitive data is transferred securely over the internet and kept strictly confidential, augmented by the most recently updated firewall technologies. 

Since we operate globally, it may be necessary to transfer your Personal Information to countries outside the European Union. The data protection and other laws of these countries may not be as comprehensive as those in the European Union. In such instances, we will take steps to ensure that a similar level of protection is given to your Personal Information. Note that by using our site and our services, you consent to the transfer of your Personal Information to countries outside the European Union.   

**Retention of personal information  **

Please note that unless you instruct us otherwise, we retain the information we collect for as long as needed to provide our services.

Note, however, we may be required to continue to retain records containing your information for legitimate business, regulatory, compliance and/or legal purposes. We may also rectify, replenish, or remove incomplete or inaccurate information at any time and at our own discretion.  

**Winnings**

We believe that your good fortune is ultimately your own business. We therefore keep all our members' winnings and withdrawals strictly confidential and private. That notwithstanding, we may publicise certain details regarding winnings for promotional purposes, including the prize (amount won), the game’s name, winner’s first name and first letter of his last name, his/her country and city. 

Note that Winspark users who win a prize may still be requested to provide their consent to be photographed, and in such an event, we may use and publicise their photograph for promotional purposes - but only if so permitted. 

Like all other information, our winnings information is stored in a secure operating environment.
