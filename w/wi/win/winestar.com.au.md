Protecting your privacy is important to WineStar. We hope the following policy will help you understand how WineStar collects, uses, and safeguards the personal information you provide on our website. 

If you browse WineStar, you do so anonymously. We don't collect personal information — including your email address. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which parts of our website you visit and how long you spend there. But we do not link your IP address to anything personally identifiable. The only other information automatically provided to us is the type of computer and operating system you are using. Your browser supplies us with this information. 

At times we may request that you voluntarily supply us with your email address, for purposes such as corresponding with us or making a purchase. If you provide us with your email address, we will send you The WineStar Journal on a weekly basis featuring the wines you want at the prices you want - including all the 'hard-to-gets'. We do not share your personal information with other companies under any circumstances - the exception being only the delivery address displayed for the logistical purposes in sending you any purchase made.

WineStar provides customers with an easy means to decline to receive email offers. Although most customers tell us they appreciate receiving notice of these opportunities, we recognize the importance of providing you with choices. At any time, you may request to discontinue receiving these offers from us by simply replying to the email and informing us of your preferences. All email offers that you receive from WineStar will tell you how to decline further email offers.
