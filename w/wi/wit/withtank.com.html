  <div><p>thisarmy respects the privacy of each Customer. thisarmy has
established this Privacy Policy to explain how Data is collected by
thisarmy, and how this Data is used and disclosed. thisarmy takes
the protection of Personal Information very seriously. thisarmy may
process (for example, collect, use or disclose) Personal
Information only as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Version number: 1.0</p>
<h2>Definitions and Interpretations</h2>
<p><strong>Definitions.</strong> For purposes of the Privacy
Policy:</p>
<p>‘<em>Data</em>’ means any data (including Personal
Information) provided to thisarmy by a Customer;</p>
<p>‘<em>Personal Information</em>’ means any Data or
information about an identifiable Customer, including an email
address.</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation.</strong> Words defined or assigned a
meaning in the Agreement will have that meaning in this Privacy
Policy, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.</p>
<h2>Collection</h2>
<p><strong>Collection on registration.</strong> Once a Customer
registers with thisarmy, a Customer is not anonymous to thisarmy.
When registering, each Customer provides Data, which includes an
ID, a password, and an email address. To combat online fraud,
thisarmy may also record the IP address of a Customer when adding
Data. In addition, a Customer may provide necessary Personal
Information to process a credit card payment, including a billing
address.</p>
<p><strong>Decline to share.</strong> A Customer can decline to
share Personal Information with thisarmy by not registering with
thisarmy.</p>
<p><strong>Children.</strong> thisarmy does not intentionally
gather Personal Information about visitors who are under the age of
13.</p>
<p><strong>Collection from browser.</strong> thisarmy automatically
receives and records information on thisarmy’s server logs
from the browser of a Customer, including an IP address, cookie
information, and the page requested. Each Customer should be aware
that other web sites visited before entering the web site might
place Personal Information within a URL of a Customer during a
visit to it, and thisarmy has no control over such web sites.
Accordingly, a subsequent web site that collects URL information
may log some Personal Information.</p>
<h2>Use</h2>
<p><strong>Messages and updates.</strong> thisarmy may send to a
Customer administrative messages and email updates regarding its
account, the web site, or its Goods or Services. In some cases,
thisarmy may also send a Customer primarily promotional messages. A
Customer can choose to opt-out of promotional messages.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies.</strong> Personal Information may be used to
improve the web site. thisarmy may use cookies to save the IDs and
session validators of a Customer on its browsers and hard drives,
and may use cookies to provide a tailored web site. IP addresses
also help thisarmy to diagnose problems with and to administer the
web site.</p>
<p><strong>Targeted content.</strong> While a Customer is logged
into the web site, thisarmy may display targeted adverts and other
relevant information based on the Data. In a completely automated
process, computers process the Data and match it to adverts or
related information. Natural persons do not read Data to target
adverts or other information without consent. thisarmy never shares
Personal Information with any advertiser, unless a Customer
specifically asks thisarmy to do so. Advertisers receive a record
of the total number of impressions and clicks for each advert. They
do not receive any Personal Information. If a Customer clicks on an
advert, thisarmy may send a referringURL to the advertiser’s
site identifying that a Customer is visiting from the web site.
thisarmy does not send Personal Information to advertisers with the
referring URL. Once a Customer is on the advertiser’s site
however, the advertiser may collect Personal Information.</p>
<h2>Disclosure</h2>
<p><strong>No selling.</strong> thisarmy will not sell, share, or
distribute Personal Information. No Personal Information may be
disclosed to anyone except as provided in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing purposes.</strong> thisarmy may disclose
aggregate statistics (information about the customer population in
general terms) about the Data to advertisers or business partners
for marketing purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Third party supplier or agents.</strong> thisarmy may
need to provide Data to a third party supplier to supply or provide
specific Goods or Services to a Customer (such as hosting services,
support services, shipping services, or payment processing). Each
third party supplier is required to only disclose or use the Data
to supply or provide the specific Goods or Services requested.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement.</strong> thisarmy may disclose Data if
required: by a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order
by law; to protect the safety of any individual or the general
public; to prevent violation of the Agreement, or the rights of
thisarmy or any third party. An IP address may be disclosed to a
third party: if the law or a legal process requires it; to protect
the rights or property of thisarmy, a Customer, or the general
public.</p>
<p><strong>Affiliates.</strong> thisarmy may share Data with an
Affiliate, in which case thisarmy will seek to require the
Affiliates to honour this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Change of ownership.</strong> If thisarmy undergoes a
change in ownership, or a merger with, acquisition by, or sale of
assets to, another entity, thisarmy may assign its rights to the
Data it processes to a successor, purchaser, or separate entity.
thisarmy will notify each Customer of the transfer and the Customer
may choose to modify its Personal Data at that time. If a Customer
is concerned about its Data migrating to a new owner, the User may
deactivate or delete its account.</p>
<p><strong>Employees.</strong> thisarmy may need to disclose Data
to its employees that require the Data to do their jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Abuse.</strong> thisarmy may disclose Data to designated
third parties to resolve or investigate abuse complaints. thisarmy
may release Data to assist in attempting to block an abusive
Customer or complain to its Internet Service Provider of an abusive
Customer.</p>
<h2>Security of data</h2>
<p>thisarmy uses some of the most advanced security measures to
protect the Data under its control. All Data is safe, secure, and
available only to the Customer and those to whom Customer has
granted permissions. In addition, the web site is hosted in a
secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced
security measures to prevent interference or access from outside
intruders.</p>
<h2>Username and password</h2>
<p>During the registration process, thisarmy will provide Customer
with a username and password. It is the responsibility of each
Customer to maintain the confidentiality and security of their
password.</p>
<h2>Updating or removing</h2>
<p>A Customer may choose to correct or update the Data they have
submitted to thisarmy, by going to their account. To remove any
Data from the active database of thisarmy, a User may deactivate or
delete their account. Even if a Customer updates or removes their
Data from thisarmy’s live database, Data may be retained in
thisarmy’s backup files and archives.</p>
<h2>Unauthorised use</h2>
<p>Any unauthorised use of thisarmy information systems is a
violation of the Agreement and certain laws, including the section
86 of the ECT Act. Such violations may subject the person to civil
and criminal penalties.</p>
<h2>Intercept and monitor</h2>
<p>thisarmy may intercept, monitor, block, filter, read, delete,
and disclose any communication over its information system.</p>
<h2>Limitation</h2>
<p>thisarmy is not responsible for, gives no warranties, nor makes
any representations in respect of the privacy policies or practices
of linked or any third party web sites.</p>
<h2>International customers</h2>
<p>thisarmy may transmit or transfer Personal Information outside
the resident jurisdiction of the Customer and therefore across
borders. Personal Information may be stored on servers located in
the United States where laws protecting Personal Information may
not be as stringent as the laws in the jurisdiction of the
Customer. Personal Information may be processed by thisarmy in the
country where it was collected as well as other countries
(including the United States) where laws regarding processing of
Personal Information may be less stringent.</p>
<h2>Enquiries</h2>
<p>If anyone has any questions or concerns arising from this
Privacy Policy or the way in which thisarmy handles Personal
Information, please contact <a>support@withtank.com</a>.</p></div>
