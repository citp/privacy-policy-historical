### 4\. Collection and processing of personal and other data during

visits to our internet presence

**4.1 Anonymous use of the site**

Usage of our website is possible without providing any personal data. Data collected automatically will always be anonymised prior to their storage and usage (in this context, see section 4.2 below).

**4.2 Non-personal data collected automatically (logfile information)**

When using this internet presence, so-called logfile information will be recorded - this being standard procedure on the internet. This non-personal information is transmitted automatically by your internet browser. This information includes in particular: IP address, accessed pages within the internet presence, date and time of the visit, cookies, used browser, operating system of the accessing computer, language setting and transferred data volume. The processing of the logfile information is done mainly in order to establish the connection, to ensure system security and for reasons of technical administration.

Also, logfile information is exclusively stored and analysed statistically in an anonymous form, in order to continuously improve this internet presence, to adjust it to the users' interests and to speed up the detection and/or elimination or bugs (in this context, see Section 5 below).

Wirecard shall store logfile information for security reasons (e.g. in order to clarify cases of abuse or fraud), for a maximum period of seven days, and shall then delete such information. Data which must be stored beyond that for reasons of evidence are excluded from the deletion up until the relevant incident has been clarified.

**4.3. Collecting and processing our customer's personal data**

Some of our internet presences offer registration and/or login options. In such cases, the following applies:

During registration, we will collect the personal data required for you to be able to use our offers as provided for in the contract, e.g. your name, e-mail address and company. We will mainly use such data to process inquiries, orders and contracts concluded with you. Your data will only be processed for other purposes if you have given your consent, or if this is permitted by law. 

For the login into restricted areas, we collect and use the personal data required to identify you, such as member ID and password (partner programme) or alias/VR identifier and PIN (eBanking).

**4.4. Usage and forwarding of personal data**

Your personal data will only be used for the specified purposes, and only to the extent required in order to achieve these purposes. Data will only be forwarded to third parties - if at all - within the limits of the statutory provisions. The transmission of personal data to government agencies and authorities shall be carried out only within the framework of mandatory national law, or if the forwarding is required for purposes of legal or criminal prosecution in the event of abuse or fraud. Forwarding for other purposes - in particular address trading - is excluded.

### 5\. Web analysis

In order to continuously improve this internet presence, to adapt it to the user's interests, and to speed up the detection and/or elimination of bugs, logfile information (for information on such data, please see Section 4 above) will be stored under a pseudonym in so-called usage profiles, and will be analysed statistically. Cookies are used for this purpose (for information on cookies, see Section 3 above). The IP address will only be stored and processed in an abbreviated form, namely without the last two blocks of numbers. The data collected will not be used to personally identify the user, and will not be merged with personal data relating to the bearer of the pseudonym, except if the user gives his/her expressed separate consent. Such data will not be forwarded to third parties. The data will be deleted as soon as storage is no longer required for purposes of web analysis.

For the web analysis described above, Wirecard uses technologies by etracker GmbH, Erste Brunnenstr. 1, 20459 Hamburg ([www.etracker.com](http://www.etracker.com/ "etracker.com website")). Data processing has been examined for data protection conformity and data safety by etracker GmbH.

### 8\. Data safety

In order to protect the personal data against loss, falsification or disclosure to unauthorised third parties, we have taken adequate organisational, technical and administrative measures.

Wirecard uses firewalls in order to prevent unauthorised access to servers; the servers are located at a safe location to which only authorised staff have access. All staff members and all persons involved in the processing of data are subject to an obligation to comply with all laws relating to data protection, and to treat personal data confidentially. However, unfortunately, there is no guarantee that 100% safety can be ensured.

## General Information on Data Protection at Wirecard Bank AG

Collecting and processing personal data

When processing payments and providing related services (e.g. risk management), Wirecard Bank AG (" **Wirecard** ") processes payment-specific data on behalf of its customers (Merchants). In its capacity as a contract data processor, Wirecard places particular focus on compliance by the Merchants with the principle of data economy as defined in the BDSG.

The data controller within the meaning of the BDSG for the processed payment data is the Merchant. During the processing of payments, particularly sensitive data such as credit card numbers and account data are being processed. The data are stored in the Wirecard data banks exclusively in accordance with the PCI-DSS rules, in encrypted form. 

The data processed on behalf of the Merchants will be used exclusively for the purposes requested by the Merchants - such as payment processing and risk management. In this context, depending on the assigned service providers, other data from external sources - e.g. IP geolocation information or credit rating information - may be collected with about the Merchants' customers.

All data processed on behalf of the Merchants will be stored in accordance with the Merchants' instructions, and will be deleted upon their request, however, no later than upon expiry of the statutory deadlines. Should a Merchant's customer request deletion of his/her personal data prior to expiry of these deadlines, the deletion will usually be replaced by a blocking. 

Forwarding personal data

Wirecard will only use the personal data for the purposes set out in the Merchant's assignment. In this context, data will only be forwarded to subcontractors of the Wirecard Group, within the framework of the processing of business transactions. For assigned purposes of verifying identities or preventing fraud, data may be forwarded to the corresponding service providers, such as credit rating agencies. 

Data shall not be forwarded to other third parties - in particular not for address trading. 

Revocation rights regarding the collection, processing and use of personal data

The Merchant's customers may revoke at any time with effect for the future a declaration of consent given previously regarding the collection, processing and use of personal data. The recipient of such revocation declaration is the Merchant. We would like to emphasise that in the event of a revocation, Wirecard may under certain circumstances no longer be able to provide the requested services.
