This Privacy Policy tells you about the personal information that we gather from you and what we do with that information.

	<td><span class="helpBoldLegalTxt">The Information We Collect<br></span>
<span class="helpLegalTxt">WireImage wants to provide you with an efficient, easy-to-use, customized service. For this reason, we collect some personal information from you, but we try to keep the information that we collect to an absolute minimum. When you register with WireImage, we ask for your email address, and we require you to choose a username and password for use on our site. We also ask for your address and phone number. We use your contact information from the registration form to send you necessary information about WireImage (such as confirmation of your registration). Your contact information is also used to contact you when necessary.
<p>
If you download images from our site, we collect information about your downloading activity. If you send email communications to us, we retain your correspondence for tracking purposes only and will not use it for any secondary purpose or to send you unsolicited email.
</p><p>
We use cookies, which are small pieces of text stored on your computer, to provide services that are tailored to you. If your browser is set to reject cookies, you will not be able to use our site. We track certain information about you (such as your IP address, your browser type, and the URLs that you came from and go to next) based on your activity on the WireImage website. We use this information to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our website, to help identify you, and to gather broad demographic information. We use your personal information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze site usage, to improve our content offerings, and to customize our site's services.

	<td><span class="helpBoldLegalTxt">Disclosure of Your Personal Information<br></span>
<span class="helpLegalTxt">WireImage takes extensive measures to protect your anonymity.  We do not give, sell, rent, share, or trade any personal information about you to third parties. WireImage will not give out your personal information, including your name or email address, to third parties except as required by law. Your personal information is used to tailor our services to match your interests and to let you know about special offers available through WireImage. We will only share demographic and profile data on an aggregate basis, and will never personally identify you when doing so.
<p>
WireImage does reserve the right to disclose your username, name, address, email, and other personal information in our sole discretion as we believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation for fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other illegal activity as well as dispute resolution and enforcement of our Terms and Conditions.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will remain absolutely private.<br></p></span></td>

<span class="helpLegalTxt">You have the option to remove your contact information from our database if you decide that you no longer want to be an WireImage member or to use the WireImage services. To do so, contact Customer Service with your request.
<p>
We will retain in our files information that you have requested to remove in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our User Agreement. Further, such prior information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact that we back up our systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personal information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.<br></p></span></td>
