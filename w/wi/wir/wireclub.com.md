### Information automatically collected from visitors:

We use your computer’s IP address (a unique number used to identify your computer on the internet) to maintain statistics and to identify potential problems. Your IP address is not tied to your personal information in any way and can not be used to identify you.

Any information that is entered as part of a public profile will be available to all visitors to the website but will never be given to third parties as a bulk operation. We enforce our user’s right to privacy and never publicize fields that are marked as private such as your real name. Any field that has an opt-out option such as ‘prefer not to say’ is up to the user to provide and will not deny access to any part of the site.
