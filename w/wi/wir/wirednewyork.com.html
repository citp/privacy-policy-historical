        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h2> How we gather information from users</h2>
        <p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, 
          the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. 
          For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register 
          for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, 
          such as discussion board, newsletters, news updates and other products. 
        </p>
        <p> Like most Web sites, Wired New York also collects information automatically 
          and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our 
          visitors. For example, we may log the name of your internet service 
          provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information 
          from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user 
          name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information 
          each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter 
          a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional 
          technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain 
          cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example 
          by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you 
          may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked 
          to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize 
          the site’s features according to your preferences.</p>
        <h2>What we do with the information we collect</h2>
        <p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit 
          and deliver more individualized content and advertising, and we sometimes 
          permit our advertising and promotional partners to call to your attention 
          products, special offers and unique content we believe might be of interest 
          to you. We offer you the opportunity to elect not to receive direct 
          communications sent by our advertisers or promotional partners, as described 
          below.</p>
        <p>Aggregated information (information that does not personally identify 
          you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information 
          about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other 
          users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages 
          are visited most or what features are most attractive). Again, this 
          information does not include any personally identifiable information 
          about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.</p>
        <p>We may use personally identifiable information collected on Wired New 
          York to communicate with you about your registration and customization 
          preferences; our terms of service and privacy policy and other topics 
          we think you might find of interest. </p>
        <p>Personally identifiable information collected by Wired New York may 
          also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, 
          troubleshooting, and other communications with you. Certain third parties 
          who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web 
          hosting service provider, for example) may access such information. 
          We will use your information only as permitted by law.</p>
        <h2> Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</h2>
        <p>Wired New York expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to 
          respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, 
          including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers 
          accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection 
          policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you 
          may link to, or view as part of a frame on a Wired New York page, certain 
          content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through 
          Wired New York you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, 
          Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. 
          Wired New York is not responsible for the actions or policies of such 
          third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those 
          third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated 
          by a third party.</p>
        <p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third 
          parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some 
          of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, 
          some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies 
          that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular 
          advertisement before. Other features available on our site may offer 
          services operated by third parties and may use cookies or other technology 
          to gather information. Wired New York does not control the use of this 
          technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not 
          responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
        <p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personally 
          identifiable information on message boards, that information can be 
          viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without 
          our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals 
          or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Wired New 
          York and this policy.</p>
        <h2>How to add, change, or delete personal information </h2>
        <p>You may add, change or delete personal information on your profile 
          or registration for activities by contacting us via e-mail. Certain 
          information fields are required and cannot be deleted for security purposes 
          or in accordance with various laws. We encourage you to keep us informed 
          about any changes in your membership information and e-mail address. 
        </p>
        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>Wired New York does not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable 
          information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. 
          If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 
          in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. 
          If you believe Wired New York has any information from or about anyone 
          under 13, please contact us.</p>
