#### 5.5 Information on Web Analysis Tools 

##### 5.5.1 Google Tag Manager 

This Wirecard website uses the Google Tag Manager. Google Tag Manager is a solution enabling marketers to administer Website Tags on an interface. The tool Tag Manager itself (which implements the tags) is a cookie-less domain and does not collect personal data. The tool triggers the below described other tags which themselves may collect data, as described below. Google Tag Manager does not access these data. If a deactivation has been carried out on domain or cookie level, it remains for all tracking tags implemented with the Google Tag Manager. 

##### 5.5.2 Google Analytics

This Wirecard website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies that are stored on your computer and make it possible to analyse how you utilize the site. The information generated by the cookie (including the IP address) is transferred and stored on a Google server located in the United States. On this website, Google Analytics is extended by the code “gat._anonymizeIp():” to ensure anonymized collection of IP addresses (so-called IP-Masking). This means that Google will truncate/anonymize the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA.

Google uses the information on our behalf to evaluate how this Wirecard website is used, create reports about the activities on the site for the site operators, and to perform additional services regarding website and internet utilization. Further, Google may pass this data on to third parties, if required by law or if using their services to analyse this data. Google will not associate IP addresses with any other information held by Google. 

You can prevent the storing of cookies by choosing the appropriate settings in your browser; however, we would like to point out that in this case some functionality of the website may not be available to its full extent. Further you can prevent the collection and processing of cookie created data relating to your utilization of the website (including your IP) via Google by downloading and installing the browser-plugin available under this [link](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en "Set Google Analytics opt out cookie").

##### 5.5.3 Google AdWords

We use the so-called Conversion Tracking from Google AdWords. Google AdWords is an online advertising program of Google Inc. If you click on advertising placed by Google, a cookie for the Conversion Tracking is placed on your device. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and contain no personal data and therefore do not serve identification. If you visit certain websites within the 30-day-validity, Google can recognize that you clicked on the advertisement and that you have been forwarded to our website. Every Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. The information collected with the aid of the Conversion cookie serves the purpose of creating Conversion statistics for AdWords customers that have decided to use Conversion Tracking. Thereby Google AdWords customers find out the total number of users that have clicked on their advertisement and have been forwarded to their website. However, they do not receive any information that can personally identify a user. 

You can disable the storing of cookies in the settings options at Google (“Google Ad Settings”) using this [link](https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?passive=1209600&osid=1&continue=https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl%3Den&followup=https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl%3Den&hl=en "Opens internal link in current window").
