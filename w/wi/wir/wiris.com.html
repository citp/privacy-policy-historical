We collect some necessary personal data and billing information for this purpose, and optionally your consent to receive newsletters from our Services. Payment information is managed by leading secure payment processing providers.

<p><strong>Content you provide through our products and demos: </strong><br>
	Our services record certain requests and transactions in log files and in our cloud service. We record your IP, referrer metadata and other usage statistics. This log data is used for operating our Services, troubleshooting, statistics, analytics, quality assurance, and to monitor system security and can be analyzed to that end. We can publish anonymous statistics under the condition that no personally identifiable information can be derived from such statistics.</p>

<p><em>Cookies: </em><br>
	A “cookie” is a small piece of information that is sent by a web server to be stored on a web browser, so that it can later be read back from that browser the next time this unique visitor returns to that web server. This becomes useful for having the browser remember specific information about this visitor like location of their last visit, time spent, or user preferences (like style sheets). The cookie is a text file that is saved in the browser’s directory and is stored in RAM while the browser is running. Also, the cookie may be stored on the computer’s hard drive once you log off from that web site or web server.</p>
<p>We use a number of different cookies on our site. If you do not know what cookies are, or how to control or delete them, then we recommend you visit <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org" target="_blank">http://www.aboutcookies.org</a> for detailed guidance.</p>
<p>The list below describes the cookies we use on this site and what we use them for. Currently we operate an ‘implied consent’ policy which means that we assume you are happy with this usage. If you are not happy, then you should either not use this site, or you should delete the cookies having visited the site, or you should browse the site using your browser’s anonymous usage setting (called “Incognito” in Chrome, “InPrivate” for Internet Explorer, “Private Browsing” in Firefox and Safari etc.).</p>
<p>These are cookies that are set by this website directly.</p>

Google Analytics stores information about what pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here and what you click on. This Analytics data is collected via a JavaScript tag in the pages of our site and is not tied to personally identifiable information. We therefore do not collect or store your personal information (e.g. your name or address) so this information cannot be used to identify who you are.<br>
