                                           ●   the data are no longer required for the purposes they were
                                               acquired or otherwise processed;
                                           ● you revoke your consent, which is the basis of the data
                                               processing, and there is no other legal basis for the
                                               processing;
                                           ● you object to the processing of your data and there are no
                                               legitimate reasons for the processing or you object to data

                                               process your data
                                           ●   In particular with regard to legal retention periods
                                           ●   To assert, exercise or defend against legal claims
The      right   to    restrict You can request that we restrict the processing of your data if
processing.
                                           ●   You dispute the correctness of the data – for the period of
                                               time we need to check the correctness of the data;
                                           ●   The processing is illegal but you do not wish to have your
                                               data deleted and request a restriction of use instead;

                                               exercise or defend against legal claims;
                                           ●   You have filed an objection to the processing, though it has
                                               not yet been decided whether our legitimate grounds
                                               outweigh yours.
The right to data portability. At your request, we will transfer your data– where technically possible – to
                                another responsible entity.
                                However, this right only applies if the data processing is based on your
                                consent or is required to fulfill a contract. Instead of receiving a copy of


                               your data, you can ask us to send the data directly to another responsible
                               entity that you specify.
 The right to object.          You can object to the processing of your data at any time for reasons that
                               arise from your special situation provided the data processing is based on
                               your consent or our legitimate interest or that of a third party. In this case,
                               we will no longer process your data. The latter does not apply if we are able
                               to prove there are compelling, defensible reasons for the processing that
                               outweigh your interests or we require your data to assert, exercise or defend
                               against legal claims.
 The right      to    withdraw Withdraw the consent you gave us with regard to the processing of your
 consent.                      personal data for certain purposes, such as to allow us to promote our
                               products and services to you.
 The right to complain.        Wi Get Media AB takes your rights very seriously. However, if you are of
                               the opinion that we have not dealt with your complaints adequately, you
                               have the right to submit a complaint to the data privacy protection
                               authorities responsible. You can visit their website to find out how to

the following periods: a) any retention period set out in our retention policy which is in line with
regulatory requirements relating to retention; or (b) the end of the period in which legal action or
investigations might arise in respect of the services provided.

are either irreversibly anonymised or securely destroyed.

the current state of the art to protect and maintain the security, integrity and availability of your

or a website cannot be guaranteed, but we and our service providers and business partners do
our utmost to protect your personal data in line with the prevailing data protection legislation by
means of physical and electronic physical precautions. Among other things, we use the following
measures:
          ●    Strict criteria for authorisation to access your personal data on a “need-to-know” basis
               only and exclusively for the specified purpose;
          ● Transfer of acquired data in secured form;
