("Website") that applies to your use of the Website and covers how Modular Patterns Ltd. (“Wibiya” "we," "us," or "our") treats information that it collects and receives about you via the Website, including the personal information we collect through the Website regarding the various features, programs, services, and software that Wibiya provides to you. Some of these offerings are provided by third parties who may provide you with additional information and choices about your privacy. These offerings are subject to the privacy policies of such third parties.  
By using the Website and/or the Services (as defined below), you agree to accept the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website and/or the Services. 

## Collection of Personally Identifiable Information

Wibiya does not require Website users or visitors to provide Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") to view the content in the Website or to browse the different sections of the Website. PII is information that identifies an individual including full name, postal address, photograph, e-mail address and/or telephone number. Wibiya may collect PII from Website users or visitors who choose to use the Wibiya on-line proprietary platform (“Wibiya Platform”) or other programs, features or services offered by Wibiya (“Services”). Any information Wibiya collects is collected for the primary purpose of enabling Wibiya to provide and enhance the Services offered to our users. Wibiya does not sell or license PII collected from its Websites to third parties for their independent use.

Certain areas of the Website as well as third party websites linked to or accessible from this Website may have different privacy policies and practices. These third parties, and not Wibiya, are responsible for the privacy practices of non- Wibiya websites, or channels or areas of the Website that are operated by third parties, including but not limited to applications and/or features provided by third parties.

We, our service providers, advertisers and partners may collect various types of non-PII when you visit the Website and/or use the Services. Examples of non-PII that may be collected from visitors include: Internet protocol address, the type of browser (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), type of operating system, (e.g., Microsoft Windows or Mac OS), domain name of Internet service provider (e.g., Comcast, Verizon or AT&T), Web pages visited, websites visited before and after visiting the Website, type of handheld or mobile device used to view the Website (e.g., iPhone, Blackberry), location information, content accessed and advertisements shown and/or clicked. We may use third parties to conduct web analytics and similar services with respect to an individual’s interaction with our Website.

You may correct or update certain PII by logging in to your account with Wibiya and making the change on your personal information page. If you no longer desire our Services or wish to delete or deactivate your account, you can contact us at [support@Wibiya.com](mailto:support@Wibiya.com). 

## Registration

In order to create and maintain apps using the Wibiya Platform or use other services or programs offered by Wibiya, you must complete a registration form. During this registration you will be asked to provide a user name, a password, a valid email address and additional information as may be required as part of the specific service or program which you register to, all of which are used to validate your registration and maintain your account with Wibiya. You also may provide us with additional information (such as company name, title etc.) so we can provide you with a more customized experience on the Website and offer you better support.

From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys or special promotional or other programs on the Website. If you choose to participate, we may request certain PII from you. Participation in such contests or surveys or programs is voluntary and you have a choice whether to provide this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code), and, in the case of a special program involving a form of payment, payment details. We use this information to notify participants, to monitor Website traffic, customize the Website or send participants email updates.

When you send email or other communications to Wibiya, we may retain these communications to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.

## Choice/Opt–out

You have the option to choose to receive occasional email updates from Wibiya. Such updates can include a newsletter or other notifications in relation with the Website or the Wibiya Platform. We provide you with the opportunity to 'opt–out' of having your PII used for such purposes when we ask for this information. For example, if you do not wish to receive any additional marketing materials from us, you can indicate your preference on our registration form. If you no longer wish to receive our email updates, you may opt–out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each update or by emailing us at: [support@Wibiya.com](mailto:support@Wibiya.com). 

## Mobile/Social Network services

Wibiya may offer to end users of the Services additional features and services that provide access to mobile and social networks.

You can sign in to your social network website through the Website. When you elect to sign in, you will be asked to grant us access to certain information from your social network profile. 

This information may include friends or contacts lists, notes, updates and photos, and may be used by Wibiya to help you customize your Website and/or the Services experience, suggest new features and content that may be relevant to you or provide Wibiya with data for statistical purposes. If you elect to permit Wibiya to access this information, Wibiya may be able to see and use this information and such action may change your preexisting privacy settings, however Wibiya does not have control over the privacy settings of your social network provider. Please see your social network provider policies for any questions or concerns regarding such policies. Wibiya does not sell or rent any Personal Identifiable Information it compiles through Social Networks to any third parties for their independent use. Wibiya may provide non-identifiable, general statistical and demographic information derived from information from your Social Network to its Publishers from time to time. You may limit Wibiya’s access to your social network account(s) at any time by changing your social network settings.

## Sharing Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties

Wibiya may use third-party tools or services to provide you with certain services or programs. A list of third party companies may be obtained by sending us an e-mail request to [support@Wibiya.com](mailto:support@Wibiya.com). The privacy practices of third parties are governed by the policies of the third party. 

Wibiya may use third party service providers for the purpose of distributing emails to its registered users and/or toolbar/apps publishers or for providing Wibiya with operational services or data and server maintenance/optimization services. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy.

Wibiya may use a third party service provider to manage and operate a discussion board or other open forum within the Website for general matters of interest or special program. The use of any "public" area or feature of the Website is subject to the “public" area or feature Terms of Use. Users of the “public" area or feature may choose to place PII on messages they post. If you use a “public" area or feature on this Website, you expressly acknowledge and agree that any PII you submit there may be read, collected, or used by other users of these “public" areas or features, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the PII you choose to submit in these "public" areas or features.

Wibiya may disclose PII to its parent company and any of its subsidiaries. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy.

Wibiya may engage in business relations with third party companies and offer unique services to clients of such companies within a private label environment. For such purposes, some pages of the Website may be branded with both the Wibiya brand and the third party brand. The third party may not use the private label environment to collect any PII. This Privacy Policy applies to all of the pages in the private label environment.

We use the Crazyegg service to help us understand how people use the Website. To understand Crazyegg’s practices go to the Crazyegg privacy policy at: <http://www.crazyegg.com/privacy>. Crazyegg, and not Wibiya, is responsible for the Crazyegg privacy policy and any choices set forth in that policy. 

If you use any Ads serving services that we provide, some of these services have their own privacy policies that govern the use of their services. Our advertising partners use PII or non-PII to deliver relevant advertising. One of these privacy policies is available at: http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy, and you can opt-out of providing your information to such third party as set forth therein. To help ensure that information is not collected by these entities, you can clear all of your Cookies as provided in your browser's instructions. You can also opt-out from certain other network advertising companies that participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (by clicking on <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp> ) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (by clicking <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/> ). Companies that participate in these programs are identified on their websites. 

If you entered the Website by clicking an affiliated link or promotion on another Website, or if you used a site that provides universal registration services to sign up for the Services, we will store the ID of that affiliate site in our database along with your computer's User ID. We do this to ensure that the affiliate site receives proper credit for any subsequent app you may build using our platform.

Wibiya reserves the right to disclose your PII as required by law and/or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website.

## Use of Cookies, Server Logs or other Similar Technologies

Cookies (which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store user preferences and activity. "Web beacons" (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising and other data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. The Website, the Services and/or other third parties may use "cookies", "web beacons" and other similar information gathering technologies (collectively, "Information Gathering Technologies") to collect non PII automatically as you access and browse the Website and/or use the Services and/or a Publisher website. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Wibiya only and does not cover the use of cookies by any other third party.

If you reject cookies, you may still use the Website and/or the Services, but your ability to use some areas of the Website and/or the Services may be limited.

By visiting the Website and/or using the Services, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to gather information about your use of the Website and/or the services through these Information Gathering Technologies.

Server logs capture certain non–PII, such as the time and date of a web visit, the browser and operating system being used, the IP address or domain name of the user's ISP, and the web URL a user linked from. This information is generally but not exclusively used to help plan system enhancements when necessary and to provide content which is compatible with our visitors' web browsing systems. 

We may also use the data collected by Information Gathering Technologies, individually and combined with other data, to perform tasks including customizing content, customizing advertising, and other related functions such as measuring the effectiveness of advertising.

## Security

The security of your personal information is important to us, and we take steps to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on the Website, you can contact us at [privacy@Wibiya.com](mailto:privacy@Wibiya.com). 

## Changes to this Privacy Statement

From time to time we may update this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to visit this area frequently to stay informed.

## Corporate Change

In the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be among the assets transferred.
