		<p>
      You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
    </p> 
    <p>
      Wibki is not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of websites to which the site may link.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our principal activity entails a visual portal and bookmark manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our privacy policy covers Wibki and its website: 
    </p>
      <p>Organisation Name: All My Faves Inc.</p>
	  <p>Web Sites(s): http://www.wibki.com</p>
      <p>City: Tel Aviv</p>
      <p>Country: Israel</p>  
    <p>
      At Wibki, we recognize that your privacy and that of your personal information is important. Below we provide information on what types of personal information we receive and maintain in our company's records when you use/visit Wibki, and how we safeguard that information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wibki collects and uses personally identifiable information for the following reasons and purposes only: providing users with the services made available through the wibki.com including, but not limited to the service, to communicate with users, and to manage users' registered accounts, if and when applicable.
    </p>
    <h4 class="sub-title">Log Files</h4>
    <p>
      As with most other websites, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data" ). The information in the log files may include your IP address (Internet Protocol) , your ISP (Internet Service Provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser through which you visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time at which you visited our site, and which pages you visited within the entire Wibki site.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Site and of our Service. We do not associate your IP address with any other personally identifiable information to identify you personally, except in case of violation of the Terms of Use.
    </p>
    <h4 class="sub-title">Cookies and Web Beacons</h4>
    <p>
      Wibki uses cookies to store information such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. If you are not familiar with what cookies are, here is a brief explanation: A cookie is a small data file many websites (Wibki.com included) carry to your computer's hard disk. Wibki does not use cookies to collect users' personally identifiable information. We use cookies as an improvement tool for the Company, the Wibki.com website and our offered services. More specifically, we use cookies as data information regarding users' site preferences and navigation behavior, and website traffic and referred visitor statistics (navigation between WIBKI.com and other websites). 
    </p>
    <p>
      A session cookie makes certain site features and services possible, yet is only a session long, meaning once you log out or turn your computer off, the cookie ceases its activity and is removed from your computer. A persistent cookie stays in your computer despite disconnecting from your browser, and is used by the browser in re-visits to the web site. You can remove persistent cookies by consulting your browser support/help service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or manage your preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. One of the consequences might be users' inability to log in to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.

  <h4 class="sub-title">Advertisment</h4>
  <p>
    Wibki uses third party advertisements on Wibki to support our web site. Some of these advertisers may use web technologies such as cookies and web beacons on our site. These technological tools send participating advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information such as your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, information regarding your installed Flash software. This is generally used for geo-targeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or for showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
  </p>
    <p>
    AdWords Remarketing is a Remarketing and Behavioral Targeting service provided by Google. It connects the activity of www.wibki.com with the Adwords advertising network and the Doubleclick Cookie. You can opt out of the cookie tracking here: http://google.com/settings/ads/onweb/optout?hl=en Personal Data collected: Cookie and Visit Data. Place of processing: USA.
