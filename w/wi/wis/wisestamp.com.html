<p>Last Revised: <strong>June 05, 2011 </strong></p>
<p>WiseStamp Ltd. ( “Company” or “we”) respects the privacy of the visitors of its Site and the users of its Platform (as such terms are defined in the Site’s Terms of Use, available at [<a href="http://www.wisestamp.com/terms">http://www.wisestamp.com/terms</a>] and is committed to protect the information of its users (“User” or “you”).</p>
<p>We believe that you have a right to know our practices regarding the information we may collect, use and disclose when you use our Platform and/or visit the Site. We made many efforts to provide you with a transparent, detailed and clear privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy will tell you, among other things, what type of information we gather, how we may use or disclose that information and our efforts to protect it. The guidelines contained herein apply to your visit or use of the Site and/or any use of the Platform.</p>
<p>We encourage you to read our policy carefully, and feel free to <a href="http://www.wisestamp.com/contact">contact us </a>if you have any questions regarding its contents. WiseStamp may update this Privacy Policy from time to time – we encourage you to review it periodically.</p>
<h2>Acceptance of the Policy</h2>

<p>We collect two types of data and information:</p>
<p>A. <strong>Non-personal Information</strong> – The first type of information is non-identifiable and anonymous information (“<strong>Non-personal Information</strong>”). To put it simply, we have no idea what is the identity of the User from which we have collected the Non-personal Information. Like most websites on the Internet the Non-personal Information which is being gathered consists of technical information and behavioral information, as detailed below:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Technical information: </strong></p>
