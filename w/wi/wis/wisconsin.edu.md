## Personal information

We will use personal information that you provide via e-mail or through other online means only for purposes necessary to serve your needs, such as responding to an inquiry or other request for information.

We also use statistic information to determine which information is of most interest to users, to identify system problem areas, or to help determine technical requirements. The server log information does not include personal information.
