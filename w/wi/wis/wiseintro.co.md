## 1\. Types and Methods of Data Collection 

We collect the following main types of data (which, to the extent it relates to an identified or identifiable individual, is deemed as “ **Personal Data** “):

  * **Data automatically collected or generated about a person:** when someone visits, interacts with or uses our Services, including any e-mail or text messages sent to them by us or via our Services (and any e-mails including e-mail signatures generated via our Services), we may collect or generate certain technical data about them. We collect or generate such data either independently or with the help of third party services (as detailed in Section 4 below), including through the use of “cookies” and other tracking technologies (as further detailed in Section 5 below).   
Such data mainly consists of technical or aggregated usage data, such as IP address, non-identifying data regarding a device, operating system and browser, traffic source and user activity on our Services. We do not use such data to learn about a person’s true identity or contact details, and it mostly serves us to better understand how people typically use and engage with our Services and to improve our marketing campaigns and engagements, as well as the overall performance of our Services. 
  * **Data received from you:** you may provide us with your Personal Data voluntarily, either directly (by submitting it yourself) or by signing up to our Services using your social network account (e.g. connecting your Facebook, Instagram, Etsy, Google or Twitter account to our Services) and selecting to grant our Services access to certain data available on such account(s) (“ **Social Account Integration** “).   
Such Personal Data typically includes account creation data (full name, e-mail address, hashed password), contact and professional information (name, company, position, e-mail address, phone and physical address), social profiles (links to your profile(s) on LinkedIn, Twitter and other social networks), and other data you choose to provide when you use our Services or contact us. If you choose to create (or upgrade to) a premium account, additional details (such as payment and billing information) may be provided, either to us or directly to such online payment processing services that we may use at such time (please see below regarding third party service providers).   
Some of our Services also enable you to submit texts, images and similar forms of content, as part of your use of our Services, via ‘Contact Us’ forms, Support queries, etc. Such content may also include Personal Data, should you choose to submit it. 
  * **E-mail account data and content:** in order to use the WiseStamp and/or WiseStats Services, you will be required to link your User account with one or more of your e-mail accounts (e.g. Gmail), and permit our Services to automatically scan, analyze, identify and extract certain Personal Data in and from such e-mail accounts. Specifically, the following data will be saved to our Services: contacts information (e-mail sender, recipient(s), time of e-mail) This is done solely in order to provide you with such Services.   
The specific access and use privileges requested are displayed in the notice which appears during the account linking process. **Please read this notice carefully, and make sure that you understand which privileges are granted and what information you make available to us by linking your e-mail account(s).**
  * **Data collected via e-mail signatures:** when you use our WiseStamp service and integrate a generated signature in your e-mails, this allows us to collect non-personal data on such e-mails sent/received which contain WiseStamp-generated signatures, such as statistical data concerning e-mail usage. This is done by using standard e-mail tracking methods, such as measuring hyperlink clicks, embedding tracking pixels, and by using dedicated third-party services, such as Google Analytics. 
  * **Data concerning your organization:** If you create an organizational account, you may also provide us certain details concerning your organization, such as the organization’s billing details, main contact persons, and business needs and preferences. To the extent that such data concerns a non-human entity, we do not regard it as “Personal Data” and this Notice shall not apply to it. 
  * **Non-personal (anonymous) Data:** such Non-personal data does not and may not relate or refer to any specific individual, and we therefore do not regard it as “Personal Data” and may use it without restriction, for example to aggregate data for industry benchmarks or comparative performance metrics, that we might publish from time to time.
