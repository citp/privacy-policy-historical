<h2>wis.dm Privacy Policy </h2>
Effective as of 24th April 2007 
 
<h3>Introduction </h3>
Welcome to wis.dm, a social network that enables members to ask questions, give and 
get answers, spark a debate or test an idea (the “wis.dm Service”). 
We understand you may not want everyone in the world to have access to the information 
you share on wis.dm, which is why we believe you should have control over your 
personal information, in terms of both the nature and extent of the information you 
supply, as well as with whom you are prepared to share that information.  
 
By using or accessing wis.dm, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy 
Policy. 
 
<h3>Information collected by wis.dm </h3>
There are several types of information that are provided to us:  
 
<ul>
  <li>personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us; </li>
  <li>information and content that you upload and contribute; and </li>
  <li>information collected by us as you interact with wis.dm </li>
</ul>
 
When you register to become a member of wis.dm, you submit certain personal 
information, such as your name and email address and any other personal or preference 
information that you choose to submit. 
 
We also collect your browser type and IP address. In addition, we store certain 
information from your browser using "cookies”. Cookies are a standard Internet 
technology, and many major web sites use them to provide useful features for their 
members. Cookies allow us to store and retrieve login information on a user's system. 
They provide us with data that we can use to improve the quality of our service and make 
it easier to use. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you 
can set yours to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of 
our web site if you do so. 
 
When you use wis.dm, there is a variety of functionality at your disposal. We collect 
information on your use of such functionality so that we can provide you with the wis.dm 
Service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain such information. When 
you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a 
reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information. 
 
If you post personally identifiable information in areas of the site accessible to other 
users, you should be aware that such information can be read, collected, or used by other 
users of these areas, and could be used improperly to send you unsolicited messages. We 
are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in 
these forums or for others’ misuse of such information. Any misuse or improper 
collection of information provided on wis.dm is a violation of the wis.dm Terms of Use 
and should be reported. 
 
wis.dm may also collect information about you from other sources, such as blogs and 
other users of the wis.dm Service through the operation of the service (e.g. topic tags) in 
order to provide you with more useful information and a more personalized experience. 
 
By using wis.dm, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and 
processed in the United States.  
 
<h3>Age Limitation </h3>
Anyone under the age of seventeen (17) is not eligible to use the wis.dm Service and 
must not submit any personal information to us. 
 
<h3>Use of Information </h3>
When you register with wis.dm, you create your own profile and privacy settings. Your 
profile information, as well as your name, email and photo, are displayed to other users in 
accordance with your privacy settings to enable you to connect with other users of 
wis.dm. We may use your name and email address to contact you from time to time and 
we will use your email address for security purposes to confirm that you are who you say 
you are. You can control the types and frequencies of certain emails you receive. 
 
Profile information is used by wis.dm primarily to be presented back to and edited by you 
when you access the service and to be presented to others permitted to view that 
information based on your privacy settings. In some cases where your privacy settings 
permit it, other wis.dm users may be able to supplement your profile. 
 
wis.dm may use information in your profile, such as items you view, without identifying 
you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as aggregating and 
analyzing data and site usage, and to customize the site’s content, layout and services as 
well as personalizing advertisements, promotions, products and services. 
 
We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not 
limited to blogs and other users of the wis.dm Service, to supplement your profile. Where 
such information is used, we generally allow you to specify in your privacy settings that 
you do not want this to be done or to take other actions that limit the connection of this 
information to your profile.  
 
<h3>Sharing Information with Third Parties </h3>
We do not provide contact information to third party marketers without your permission. 
We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we 
believe such sharing is necessary. 
  
We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we 
offer, such as using a third party to host the wis.dm Service at a co-location facility for 
servers, to send out email updates about wis.dm, to process payments for products or 
services, or to provide search results or links (including sponsored links). In connection 
with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to 
your personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these business 
activities. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, 
we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that 
information to the wis.dm-specified purposes.  
 
We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as 
subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal 
information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law 
enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may 
share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to 
protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated 
through the wis.dm Service or using the wis.dm name, or to prevent imminent bodily 
harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or 
government agencies.  
 
We let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers 
through on-site offers.  
 
We may offer stores or provide services jointly with other companies on wis.dm., and we 
may share customer information with that company in connection with your use of that 
store or service.  
 
If the ownership of all or substantially all of the wis.dm business, or individual business 
units owned by Soflow, Inc., were to change, your user information may be transferred to 
the new owner so the service can continue operations. 
  
Advertisements that appear on wis.dm are sometimes delivered directly to users by third 
party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These 
third party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other 
technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising 
content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time 
they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to 
personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where 
individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine 
which advertisements are clicked. wis.dm does not have access to or control of the 
cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no 
access to your contact information stored on wis.dm unless you choose to share it with 
them.  
This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by wis.dm and does not cover the use of 
cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.  
 
<h3>Links </h3>
wis.dm may contain links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the 
privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave 
our site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally 
identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by 
wis.dm. 
 
<h3>Internet Awareness </h3>
Whenever you voluntarily post personal information in public areas you should be aware 
that this information can be accessed by the public and can in turn be used by others to 
send you unsolicited communications. Please exercise discretion in deciding what 
information you disclose. 
 
<h3>Changing and/or Removing Information </h3>
You can review and revise your personal information, and who will be given access to 
your personal information, at any time. 
 
You have the option to cancel your membership at any time by sending an email to 
feedback@wis.dm. 
 
<h3>Security </h3>
The security of your personal information depends on your protection of your account 
password. Please do not disclose your account password to unauthorized people. wis.dm 
uses industry standard technology designed to help keep your personal information safe. 
If you have any other questions about the security of our website, please contact us. 
 
<h3>Changes in Privacy Policy </h3>
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or delete portions of 
this Privacy Policy at any time without further notice. If we do this, we will post the 
changes to this Privacy Policy on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the 
Privacy Policy's effective date. Your continued use of the wis.dm Service after any such 
changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy. It is your responsibility to 
regularly review this Privacy Policy. 
 
<h3>Contacting Us </h3>
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at
