### Information Sharing

wiseGEEK takes the privacy of our visitors very seriously. wiseGEEK does not share the information it collects, whether general or personal, in any specific way with third parties without visitor consent or as otherwise required by law. 

wiseGEEK may collect (1) personal or (2) general visitor-related information: 

###  (1) Personal Information Including Email Addresses

In order to receive additional services, visitors may be required to provide personal information such as names and email addresses.

###  (2) General Information
