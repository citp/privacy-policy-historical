## Privacy Policy

(' **We** ') Cupid plc are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.

This policy (together with our [terms and conditions of use](https://web.archive.org/helptandc.asp?s=s) and any other documents referred to there) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.

We are the data controller for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the ' **Act** ').

**What information do we collect about you?**

We may collect and process the following information about you: 

  * Information that you provide by filling in forms on our site **WildBuddies** (the ' **Site** ') (including your personal details, contact details, and other profile information that you submit when you create a membership profile). We may also collect information when you voluntarily complete customer surveys, provide feedback, and participate in competitions.
  * If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.
  * Details of transactions you carry out through the Site, including any information we require to provide any products or services that you order from us through the Site.
  * Website usage information using cookies (see below under 'Cookies').



**How will we use the information about you?**

We use the information we hold about you in the following ways: 

  * To administer your user account with us (including notifying you of any compatible matches, tips, announcements, updates, special offers, or services, should you consent to this).
  * To help us improve the structure, layout, and usability of the Site.
  * To allow you to participate in interactive features of the Site.
  * To help personalize your repeat visits to the Site.
  * To provide you with information, products, or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes (see below under ' **Marketing** ' for more information).
  * To answer any questions you may raise or respond to any comments you may send to us.
  * To notify you about changes to our service or the functionality of the Site.
  * To carry out market analysis and research.
  * To ensure that you are complying with the [terms and conditions of use](https://web.archive.org/helptandc.asp?s=s) and to comply with our statutory and regulatory obligations.



**Disclosure of your information**

As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy assets. In such transactions, the information we have collected about you will generally be one of the transferred business assets. In the unlikely event that we or our assets are purchased, your information will also be one of the transferred assets. We may share information about you with: 

  * Other companies in the same corporate group as us.
  * A buyer or prospective buyer of our business.
  * Our professional advisers, such as our lawyers, where it is necessary for them to advise us.
  * Other persons if we are under a duty to disclose or share your information in order to comply with any legal obligation.



We may also share information about you with third parties that we engage to help us in certain areas, such as processing payments for services you order from us. However, we will control and be responsible for the use of your information by these third parties.

We may also provide information about you to other users of the Site as reasonably required in order to provide the services that you order from us. 

**Marketing**

We would like to send you information about goods and services offered by us and selected third parties that we think may be of interest to you. If you do not want us to use your data in this way, or to pass your details on to third parties for marketing purposes, please tick the appropriate boxes situated in the ' **My Account** ' area of the Site. You can also ask us not to use your personal information, or to pass your details on to third parties for marketing purposes, by e-mailing us at: [unsubscribe@wildbuddies.com](mailto:unsubscribe@wildbuddies.com)

**Cookies**

We may collect information about your computer, including (where available) your IP address, operating system, and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns and does not identify any individual. For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general Internet usage by using a cookie file stored on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. They help us to improve the Site and to deliver a better and more personalized service. They enable us: 

  * To estimate our audience size and usage patterns.
  * To store information about your preferences and allow us to customize the Site according to your individual interests.
  * To speed up your searches.
  * To recognize you when you return to the Site.



For further information about cookies, visit: [http://www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/)

You can set your browser to not accept cookies and the above website tells you how to do that. However, in a few cases some of the features on our Site may not function as a result. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to the Site.

**Where we store your personal data**

The personal data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a location outside the United States (' **USA** '). It may also be processed by staff located outside the USA who work for us or for one of our suppliers (for example, staff who are involved in providing services that you order from us, processing your payment details, or providing support services for the Site). By submitting your personal data to us through the Site, you agree to this transfer, storing, or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password or user ID code which enables you to access certain parts of the Site, you are responsible for keeping the password or user ID code confidential. We ask you not to share a password or user ID code with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Athough we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data as it is transmitted to the Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.

**Other websites**

The Site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.

**Access to information and correction**

You have the right to request a copy of the information we hold about you. Please note that we may make a small charge for this service.

All requests for copies of personal data should be made in writing by post or e-mail - we will not handle data requests by telephone. Please e-mail [datarequest@cupid.com](mailto:datarequest@cupid.com) with this information to enable us to verify your identity so that we can ensure that your information is kept securely: 

  * Full Name

  * Which site does your request relate to? (e.g., WildBuddies)
  * What is your site username?
  * What e-mail address did you register on your account (if different from the e-mail address above)?



You can make a data request for yourself, or on behalf of someone else, provided that written consent has been obtained from them and passed to us for verification. If you are making a request on someone elseвЂ™s behalf please also provide us with your name, address, and contact e-mail or telephone number, together with a copy of that person’s written consent.

We are legally required to respond to your request within 40 days. There may be circumstances when we require further information before we can proceed with the request; in such cases, we will contact you promptly to resolve the issues and satisfy the request.

We want to make sure that your personal information is accurate and up to date. You can ask us to correct or remove information that you think is inaccurate at any time by e-mailing us at [datarequest@cupid.com](mailto:datarequest@cupid.com).

**Changes to our privacy policy**

We keep our privacy policy under regular review and will post any changes to it on this page. We encourage you to review our privacy policy regularly to make sure you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we may share it with other parties.
