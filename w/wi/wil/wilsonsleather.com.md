Privacy and Security

Our goal at wilsonsleather.com is to provide a safe, secure, and pleasant shopping experience. We are committed to protecting your privacy and security as a customer. To show our commitment, we created this privacy and security statement to disclose our information-gathering and usage practices for wilsonsleather.com. Bottom line, we only collect information that you give us, and _we do not rent or sell your personal information to anyone._ When and why do we collect information, and how do we use it?  
We use third-party service providers to gather and analyze information about our customers to help us better deliver our products and services for our customers. This information may include personally identifiable information you provide to us, such as your first name and email address. We provide you the option to deactivate wilsonsleather.com's ability to analyze your browsing and purchase behavior through the use of these third-party services. To find out more about our service providers, including their privacy policies and how to opt out, go to the opting out section below.

We also use third parties to help us maintain and manage our customer information, to fulfill promotions, and to communicate with our customers. Wilsonsleather.com, or its contracted third-party partners, may contact you via email, direct mail, telephone, or in person. We do not authorize any of those third parties to make any other use of this information.  
We use aggregate demographic and site-traffic data internally, and we may provide this anonymous aggregate information about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to trusted third-party vendors.  
Our registration form asks you to give us contact information (like name, mailing address, and email address). We use this information to speed up the order process, and to contact you when you request or when it's necessary (for example, if there's a problem fulfilling your order).

We collect personal information from you in the following places:

  * When you place an order, we request your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, credit card number and expiration date. We use this information to process and deliver your order, and to update you on order status. 
  * When you register for an account, we ask for your name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address and password. You may also add your credit card information by visiting [My Account](https://www.wilsonsleather.com/account/login/loginmain.jsp?gate=acct&toURL=/account/accountmain.jsp) after you have registered. This data is stored securely, and you don't have to re-enter it with each visit to our web site. It's also used to recognize you as a repeat customer so we can personalize your shopping experience. Once you have registered with wilsonsleather.com you will have access to our special features, including a personal address book, which conveniently stores your address or those of your friends and family. 
  * When you join the Wilsons Leather E-mail List, we request your e-mail address to send you e-mail on the latest sales, special promotions, advanced notice of sweepstakes and events, and special offers.

To deliver this information to you, we use CheetahMail, an e-mail marketing service that helps us to conduct targeted permission-based email campaigns. When registering for our e-mail program, _CheetahMail may collect and store the personal information that you provide on our behalf. CheetahMail will not share, rent, sell, trade or provide any of this information to parties other than Wilsons Leather._ To learn more about CheetahMail's privacy policy, go to [http://www.cheetahmail.com/privacy/privacy.html.](http://www.cheetahmail.com/privacy/privacy.html) If you are no longer interested in receiving Wilsons Leather E-mail, instructions for removal from the list are included in every e-mail that we send you.

  * When you visit wilsonsleather.com, you are identified by a unique numeric id, not by personal information, allowing us to record your shopping behavior anonymously. Wilsonsleather.com uses eLuminate" by Coremetrics", an eMarketing data gathering and analysis service, to ensure visitors to this site receive relevant information and promotions that will improve your shopping experience. The primary purpose for such an analysis tool is to provide a shopping environment that saves you time, is easy, and most importantly, protects your privacy. Wilsonsleather.com uses the information to suggest new products that will complement your purchases, or show you sales promotions pertaining to what you currently have in your shopping cart, so that you don't have to navigate through multiple pages to find what you need. Coremetrics has adopted privacy guidelines set by the Federal Trade Commission. Wilsonsleather.com relies on Coremetrics Privacy Standards and encourages you to learn more by visiting <http://www.coremetrics.com/privacy.html>. If you choose not to benefit from the improved shopping experience enabled by this service, you have the option to deactivate the site's abilities to analyze your web browsing and purchasing behavior. Please view the Coremetrics Opt-Out Standard, by visiting <http://www.coremetrics.com/info_eluminate.html>, where you will find detailed information on data collection and instructions for selecting the various levels of privacy and confidentiality that you desire, while still improving your online shopping experience.

How do we protect kid's privacy?  
Wilsonleather.com is concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.

If we become aware that a subscriber is under the age of 13 and has registered without prior verifiable personal consent, we will remove his or her personally identifiable registration information from our files. Please note: we may maintain a record of that person's name and address in a "do not register file" to avoid subsequent registration by a child under the age of 13.
