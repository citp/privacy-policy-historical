          <p class="style2"><strong><a name="anchor1" id="anchor1"></a>1. The Types of Information You May Provide</strong></p>
          <p class="style2">Information you may provide in visiting our Site falls into  two broad categories: personally identifiable information and aggregate  information. "Personally Identifiable Information" is information  that can be used to identify or contact you, such as your name, social security  number, credit card information, email address, or mailing address.  "Aggregate Information" is information that does not identify you,  and may include, for example, statistical information concerning the web pages  on our Site that users most frequent. Our Privacy Policy governs both  categories of information, as detailed below.</p>
          <p class="style2"><a href="#top">Back to top</a><br clear="all">
              <br>
              <strong><a name="anchor2" id="anchor2"></a>2. Information That Identifies You: Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
          <p class="style2">We allow you to decide whether you wish to provide us with  Personally Identifiable Information. Accordingly, we have structured our Web  Site so that you may visit us, and review a range of information about  educational programs and services offered by WLT without revealing your  identity or providing any Personally Identifying Information. </p>
          <p class="style2"><strong>&nbsp;2A. Applicant and Credit Card  Information</strong></p>
          <p class="style2">Our primary means of gathering personal data are our on-line  registration application and our material order form. In the Application Form  people who wish to register for a program offered by WLT may be asked to  provide Personally Identifiable Information including but not limited to first  and last name, birth date and social security number. The data obtained through  the Application Form is used internally at WLT and possibly by an associated  college or university for the purpose of providing course credits. </p>
          <p class="style2">Please note that on occasion Wilson Language Training  Corporation (WLT) receives inquiries as to whether an individual is certified  in Wilson or  has otherwise participated in Wilson Professional Development.&nbsp; Our policy  is to not disclose personal information with regard to participants in our  programs.&nbsp; WLT will, however, unless specifically requested in writing  otherwise, share information regarding certification and the level of  participation in our professional development programs. &nbsp;</p>
          <p class="style2">When you provide information on our Material Order Form to  make a purchase, the transactional information that you provide is transmitted  in a safe, encrypted format.&nbsp; WLT is a  member in good standing of VeriSign, Inc., a leading provider of Internet Trust  Services.&nbsp; The Trust Certificate issued  to WLT from VeriSign, Inc. confirms our ability to conduct trusted and secure  electronic commerce and communications over IP networks.&nbsp; WLT uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer)  technology, an industry-standard protocol used to establish secure  communications between a web server and a client.&nbsp; We also currently support 128-bit encryption-  the most secure way currently available to protect your credit card  information.&nbsp; To maintain your security,  your encrypted credit card information is sent to the credit card authority and  approval status is sent back to us.&nbsp;  Thus, your credit card information is not stored on our network. </p>
          <p class="style2"><strong>2B. Email, Direct Communications and Other Forms</strong></p>
          <p class="style2">You may have the ability at our Site to pose certain  questions to staff in order to learn more about services offered by WLT. You  may wish to provide us with comments and feedback concerning our Site  generally. By communicating with us in these ways, you may provide us with your  email address, and other Personally Identifiable Information. All data  collected is secured at the highest level of security available to our web  server. </p>
          <p class="style2"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
          <p class="style2"><strong><a name="anchor3" id="anchor3"></a>3. We Use Your Contact Information to Keep You Informed</strong></p>
          <p class="style2">We may use Personally Identifiable Information you give to  us to provide you with information concerning our programs and services,  newsletters, updates, and related materials. We may also use this Information  to respond to questions and comments from you, and to inform you of changes to  our Privacy Policy. </p>
          <p class="style2">You may opt out of receiving email or other information from  us or have your Personally Identifiable Information deleted from our database  by following the directions set out in Section 7 ("How to Remove Your  Information from Our Database"). </p>
          <p class="style2">We will not sell or disclose any Personally Identifiable  Information you provide at our Site to any unrelated third party without your  express permission.&nbsp; By "unrelated  third parties" we mean anyone who is not involved in running the WLT Site,  not involved in fulfilling requests you make at our Site, or not providing  college credits through an affiliation with WLT.</p>
          <p class="style2"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
          <p class="style2"><strong><strong><strong><strong><a name="anchor4" id="anchor4"></a></strong></strong></strong>4. Information That Does Not Identify You: Aggregate Information</strong></p>
          <p class="style2">When you browse our Site, the choices you make may provide  information concerning your interests, and concerning the appeal and efficacy  of associated Site features. Information concerning our visitors' activities at  our Site - which pages they visit, and how long they view these pages, for  example - is Aggregate Information. This information does not identify a  particular user, but does provide potentially useful data. </p>
          <p class="style2"><strong>4A. Cookies</strong></p>
          <p class="style2">We may collect Aggregate Information about your use of our  Site through cookies and similar Internet technologies.&nbsp; If we use cookies, they do not collect or  retain your name or other Personally Identifying Information. In addition, no  third parties are permitted to use cookies we may create at our Site for their  own purposes.&nbsp; We treat all information  that may be collected through cookies and similar Internet technologies as Aggregate  Information.</p>
          <p class="style2"><strong>4B. Disabling Cookies</strong></p>
          <p class="style2">You may choose not to allow us to collect information in  this manner, through cookies. If you wish, you can set your browser software to  reject cookies.&nbsp; Most browsers provide  instructions for disabling the cookies feature in their "Help"  section. Because cookies can be used to provide certain functionality, if you  disable your browser's cookies feature, certain elements of our Site may be  unavailable to you. </p>
          <p class="style2"><strong>4C. IP Addresses </strong></p>
          <p class="style2">A so-called "Internet Protocol" (IP) address is  associated with your computer's connection to the Internet. We may use your  computer's IP address to maintain contact with you as you navigate through our Site.  We also may use your computer's IP address to provide you with personalized content.  Similar to cookies, your computer's IP address by itself does not identify you  personally. </p>
          <p class="style2"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
          <p class="style2"><strong><a name="anchor5" id="anchor5"></a>5. We Use Aggregate Information Only In Ways That Do Not Identify You</strong></p>
          <p class="style2">We may share Aggregate Information, and reports based on  this Information, with third parties unrelated to the Site. No information  which we provide to third parties will allow anyone to identify you, or  determine anything personal about you. For example, we might report to  unrelated third parties the number of users of our Site. </p>
          <p class="style2"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
          <p class="style2"><strong><a name="anchor6" id="anchor6"></a>6.&nbsp; How We Safeguard Information  We Collect</strong></p>
          <p class="style2">It is our intent to protect against the loss, misuse, or  alteration of information that we have collected from you.&nbsp; We use a variety of current technologies and  processes for protection of our customer data.&nbsp;  These systems are structured to deter and prevent hackers and others  from accessing this information. Due to the nature of Internet communications  and evolving technologies, however, we cannot provide, and disclaim, assurance  that the information you provide us will remain free from loss, misuse, or  alteration by third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain unauthorized  access. </p>
          <p class="style2"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
          <p class="style2"><strong><a name="anchor7" id="anchor7"></a>7. &nbsp;How to Remove Your  Information from Our Database</strong></p>
          <p class="style2">If you request, we will remove your name and other  Personally Identifiable Information from our databases. Please understand,  however, that it may be impossible to remove this information completely, due  to backups and records of deletions. If you wish to remove your name and other  Personally Identifiable Information from our database, please create an email  with the term "Remove" in the subject line, and send the email to the  address listed in Section 15 ("Contact Us"). As an alternative, you  may write to us with your request, at the mailing address listed in Section 15.  &nbsp;Please note, however, that some  information may be required to be retained by WLT for a certain time period for  tax reporting purposes.</p>
          <p class="style2">Because Aggregate Information does not personally identify  our users, we do not provide our users with access to Aggregate Information,  and users may not update, revise, or delete any Aggregate Information. </p>
          <p class="style2"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
          <p class="style2"><strong><a name="anchor8" id="anchor8"></a>8. Privacy Protection for Children </strong></p>
          <p class="style2">Our Site is not directed at children, and we will not accept  or request personal information from individuals we know to be under 13. In  accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, if we  learn that a child under 13 has provided us with Personally Identifiable  Information, we will delete this information from our databases. </p>
          <p class="style2"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
          <p class="style2"><strong><a name="anchor9" id="anchor9"></a>9. Participation in Online Discussions</strong></p>
          <p class="style2">If we have a "chat" or "forum" feature  on the Site, you may decide to participate in an online discussion. Please keep  in mind that any information you provide while participating in an online chat  or forum will be available to all participants. These participants, and their  transferees, may use Personally Identifiable Information and other information  you disclose in this manner, to contact you and for other purposes.  Accordingly, if we choose to provide such features at our Site, we ask that you  participate prudently, as this Privacy Policy will not cover the information  you disclose in online discussions at our Site. </p>
          <p class="style2"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
          <p class="style2"><strong><a name="anchor10" id="anchor10"></a>10.&nbsp; Links to Other Web Sites</strong></p>
          <p class="style2">To give you access to other helpful information we may  provide links to other sites. We provide these links as a convenience, and WLT  does not endorse the content or services offered by, or the privacy policies in  place at, these other sites. </p>
          <p class="style2">Our privacy policy covers only information we collect at our  Site. &nbsp;Other sites to which we link may  have privacy policies that differ considerably from our Privacy Policy. We have  structured our Site to make it reasonably clear when you leave our Web Site and  enter another web site. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of each  site you visit through our links, to ensure you are comfortable with these  policies. We are not responsible for the conduct or policies of these third  parties.</p>
          <p class="style2"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
          <p class="style2"><strong><a name="anchor11" id="anchor11"></a>11.&nbsp;&nbsp; Court Orders, Subpoenas, and  Other Required Disclosures</strong></p>
          <p class="style2">There are two exceptions to our Privacy Policy. First, we  may disclose Personally Identifiable Information as may be required in legal  proceedings, or in response to a subpoena, court order, or administrative order  compelling disclosure. Second, in cases involving a threat of imminent harm to  you or others, we may release such information to prevent or mitigate the  threat. In any such case, we will seek to limit the scope of disclosure, and  will disclose only such information as is reasonably required to fulfill the  purpose of the disclosure. </p>
          <p class="style2">As previously stated, upon request by a third party and  without otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information, we may share  information regarding certification and level of participation in our  professional development programs unless we receive a written request from the  participant to not share this information.</p>
          <p class="style2"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
          <p class="style2"><strong><a name="anchor12" id="anchor12"></a>12.&nbsp; Changes in Our Privacy  Policy </strong></p>
          <p class="style2">From time to time we may revise our Privacy Policy. We will  notify registered users of these changes, and will post the changes here. Any  changes to our Privacy Policy will apply prospectively, and we will maintain  Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with the version of the  Policy in effect at the time you submitted the information, unless you consent  to application of the revised Policy. </p>
