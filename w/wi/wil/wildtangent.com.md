What Information Does WildTangent Collect?

 **When Downloading WildTangent Products**  
The term "personally identifiable information" means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, address, email address, phone number, or other contact information. You may be asked for certain personally identifiable information when accessing a particular product or service. Occasionally, and only with your consent, we may share this information with select third parties. At the time you are asked for this information, you will be informed of the following: 

  * What specific personally identifiable information is being shared with the select third party.
  * The identity of the select third party.
  * A link to the privacy statement of the select third party, if available.

The shared information is subject to the select third parties' privacy statement. We will not resell or disclose this information to anyone other than the select third party. Should you decide not to share this information for a particular product or service, you may not be able to access the product or service, however, this will not affect your ability to access other products and services. We will not be responsible or liable if a third party violates its privacy statement. 

**When Purchasing WildTangent Products and Services**  
When you purchase a WildTangent product or service from us, we collect standard payment and billing information, including your billing address, for use in processing the payment transaction. We do not resell or share this payment information with other companies or third parties. 

We may retain the services of certain outside contractors to perform services on our behalf (for example, to help provide technical support services, to deliver new game technology, or to administer the delivery of emails to users). At times, we must disclose relevant personally identifiable information about you to our contractors so they may provide specific services for us. We require our contractors to keep this information confidential and to only use the information on our behalf. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, these contractors are not considered "select third parties" and we may disclose personally identifiable information to these contractors without providing notice to you. 

**The Security of Your Information**  
We use Secure Sockets Layer encrypted connections to transmit your payment-related personally identifiable information, including credit card information. We store personally identifiable information in encrypted form. We limit the employees that can access your personally identifiable information. We require that all of our employees, contractors, and any third parties in business with us adhere to a confidentiality policy. 

**System Configuration and Product Usage Information**  
We collect certain system configuration information through our software such as your computer's CPU speed, video card configuration, and DirectX version. We use this information to adjust the way our games and other software work in order to ensure their best possible performance. We also collect certain product usage information through our software such as the number of product launches and time spent playing a product. We use this information to determine how users are interacting with our products and what features users like and dislike, in order to find ways that our products may be improved and to help us develop new products. This system and product usage information is only collected and stored in anonymous aggregate form. We do not connect this information to you or any personally identifiable information. We may share it with select third parties on an anonymous aggregated basis. 

**GameChannel Updates and Messages**  
Our software includes a service that updates the GameChannel menu located in your Start folder with the latest games. Periodically, your computer will connect to our servers to receive the latest product updates. New product availability information or messages are transparently and unobtrusively transferred to your computer in the background, allowing you to review them later when you're off-line. You can access these product updates in the Game Channel folder of your start menu. When you install a product through a Message, your Start Menu shortcuts will be automatically updated. We collect the following information: 

  * Receipt of a message
  * Number of times a particular message is viewed and clicked on 

We use this information to better understand how the GameChannel service is used and what types of products are most popular with our users. This information is only collected and stored in aggregate form. We do not connect this information to you or any personally identifiable information. We may share it with select third parties on an anonymous aggregated basis from time to time.
