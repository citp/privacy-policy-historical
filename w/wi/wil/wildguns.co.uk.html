            When using Gameforge services, system and user-related data is collected automatically and without any further action on the part of the user. For example, when you visit a Gameforge website, the general specifications of your internet browser (e.g. type and version), time of access and the related IP address (an individual address associated with your internet connection at this time), as well as system configuration details (e.g. screen resolution and operating system version) are collected and recorded in server logs. As a rule, this information is not used to identify a specific internet user. <br>
            <br>
            In the same way, when you log into a Gameforge account (e.g. when logging into a user account for our forums, support, IRC or one of our online games), corresponding data may be collected automatically. You can find more information about this in sections 3 to 5.<br>
            <br>
            This data is processed for the purposes of safeguarding the company’s legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) to ensure the secure and smooth operation of Gameforge services, their optimisation, and for the registration, performance or termination of the user agreement with you (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)).

This identification (e.g. account or character IDs) serves the purpose of pseudonymisation and is required for technical reasons, for example for logging into and using a user account or for saving information concerning payment transactions separately. With regards to the data generated by us, this also includes data which may be recorded by our support team or community management for the purposes of carrying out their tasks. Where there is suspicion that there has been a violation of our rules of the game and Standard Terms of Use, this may include checking and documenting the facts of the case and, if necessary, issuing warnings, but potentially also comments in favour of the user concerned, such as special authorisations permitted in individual cases by the respective rules of the game.<br>

            The majority of the personal data we process is provided directly by our users. Basic information is collected when registering a Gameforge account (generally your email address and chosen pseudonym to identify your user account, your game characters and other game elements). As a rule, we do not collect any specific data such as the user’s name, date of birth or address. In individual cases (e.g. during competitions) such data may be provided by the user.<br>
            <br>
            The data provided by users also includes the content they have written (for example, texts written in a forum or within the game or other messages sent to us by a user).<br>
            <br>
            Generally, the basic versions of online games offered by us can be used free of charge. However, the user has the option to purchase additional content. For such transactions, users therefore provide us with information that is required by us or our payment service providers in order to complete the payment.<br>

            In some cases we receive personal data from third parties. This is primarily the case when using a third-party login (for example, when logging into Gameforge services via a Facebook or Steam account).

            The provision of personal data and the associated use of Gameforge services are entirely voluntary. The use of Gameforge services, however, may require the provision and processing of certain data for technical or contractual reasons. For the registration of a user account, for example, the provision of a valid email address is essential and in order to complete a payment transaction, the necessary information must be provided.<br>
            <br>
            For this reason, failure to provide the necessary data may mean that we are unable to provide certain services.

Should this occur, we will inform the person in question of the consequences in each individual case.

            In this section we explain comprehensively in which specific cases we process your data.<br>
            <br>
            The data is processed directly by Gameforge within the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany. Should in individual cases personal data be processed by a different body, such as a company associated with us or a service provider, potentially in a third country (outside of the European Union or the European Economic Area), this will always proceed within the legal framework and on the basis of a contract with the respective third party which stipulates compliance with all relevant data protection regulations.

            Like many other companies, we advertise our services on external websites. A typical example are banner adverts, which are displayed on third-party websites as a graphic advertising one of the online games we offer and linking to the corresponding Gameforge website via a hyperlink. Our partners do not provide such advertisements free of charge. The success of the advertising campaign is decisive in calculating the partner’s remuneration. In order to determine this, an ID is generated when a user clicks on the advertisement. This ID is then allocated to the user’s account when they subsequently register for a Gameforge account. This enables us to determine the number of new users we have gained through the campaign in question. Finally, the advertising partner receives a complete overview of these registrations from us and issues us an invoice based on these. In some cases, partners also receive remuneration in the event that a customer completes a payment transaction. However, we do not pass on personal information about individual users to our advertising partners.<br>

            When surfing external websites, the site operator may also set cookies (see 3.6) or create a device ID or a fingerprint (an individual value calculated from the sum of different characteristics of a user’s system) that enable the respective provider to track the surfing behaviour of its visitors. We therefore recommend that you always read the data protection provisions of a page you visit carefully.<br>

            Gameforge has no interest in tracking the external surfing behaviour of its users. However, we have a legitimate interest in finding out from which websites or through which advertising campaigns our customers have found their way to us and which areas of Gameforge’s services are of particular interest to users (see sections 3.5 and 3.7).<br>

            The purpose of the game pages is first of all to provide information about the corresponding online game.<br>
            <br>
            As a rule, contracts of use are also concluded between you and us and the subsequent use and management of your Gameforge account is made possible. As part of the registration process, we create a Gameforge account for you with the data you provide and the data we generate, such as an account ID, and record the time of registration. At the end of the process you will receive a message from us to the email address you have provided confirming the registration of your Gameforge account. In addition to the summary of your basic information, this message may contain an activation link that you can use to confirm your email address. This confirmation, the IP address assigned to you and the confirmation time will be stored by us for verification purposes.<br>
            <br>
            In this way, we will also send you contract-related notifications such as confirmation of changes to your password or the email address provided, as well as information about changes to your contract status.<br>
            <br>
            When using the game pages, basic information, usage and (when carrying out an optional payment process) billing data are processed. By basic information we mean the registration information of the Gameforge account, such as its pseudonym, the email address provided, the account IDs and, if applicable, character IDs or comparable characteristics, as well as the time of registration and the encrypted password selected by the user. Usage data comprises information that arises in the context of the actual use of a Gameforge service. This includes the IP address, time of use and the Gameforge pages visited. We use this information to identify suspicious logins and to process your requests for support. We also use this data to ensure compliance with our terms of use and, for example, to detect and prevent inadmissible multiple registrations.<br>
            <br>
            Likewise, payment transactions and thus contracts for the paid acquisition of virtual articles and for the arrangement of fee-based memberships can be concluded via the game pages. To confirm your orders and the respective contract, we will send you a corresponding message to the email address you have provided. When carrying out these optional payment transactions, we work with carefully selected payment service providers to offer you a wide range of common and convenient payment methods. When you carry out such a transaction, billing data is generated. This includes, for example, the IP address and the time of a payment transaction, the premium currency and the quantity ordered. The chosen payment method and associated details such as shortened credit card numbers (when paying by credit card) or encrypted telephone numbers (for telecommunications-based payments in connection with a landline or mobile phone) as well as an individual payment ID are also recorded and stored. This data can also be used by us to detect irregularities and to prevent attempts at fraud. In order to complete a payment transaction, it is also necessary for us to transmit the information required to allocate the transaction to the payment service provider. We may in turn receive additional information from the respective payment service providers, which we require and use solely for reasons related to tax law.<br>

            Our online games are a central component of Gameforge services. In comparison to other Gameforge services, the majority of data is collected, stored and processed through the use of our games. However, only some of this is personal data. It is also possible to use our online games using a pseudonym. In this case therefore, we generally do not know the identity of the users.<br>
            <br>
            In addition to the above-mentioned basic information and usage data, content data is also processed in connection with the online games. This includes chat messages and in-game messages written by users.<br>
            <br>
            Usage data also includes certain non-technical information about individual game scores, such as completed payment transactions and shop actions, the respective game time, number of logins, character level and level upgrades or information about rule violations, which is automatically collected by our system. In contrast, non-personal technical data such as item IDs, map coordinates and similar game-related information, which is categorised as confidential information protected as part of our trade secrets, is also processed automatically.<br>
            <br>
            We use basic information, content and usage data to determine the popularity of game content and game functions such as shop items, to process your support requests, to check compliance with the terms of use and rules of the game and to detect and sanction any potential illegal actions in an appropriate manner. As in all comparable cases, this includes contacting you by email, issuing a warning and restricting certain functions or terminating the relevant user contract in the event of a corresponding violation. In serious cases, we may also use the relevant data to assert or defend legal claims.<br>
            <br>
            In our browser games in particular, special game functions are possible, such as publicly accessible high scores and overviews, which highlight special game performances and make sanctioned rule violations transparent for all users, showing the misconduct that caused the sanction.<br>

            As described in 3.1, we have no interest in monitoring the surfing behaviour of our page visitors, nor do we track what you do on the internet after using Gameforge services.<br>

            However, we have a justified interest in the optimisation, further development and demand-oriented design of our services and in being able to better assess the benefits of our advertising measures and to remunerate them in accordance with contractual obligations. This includes information regarding how Gameforge services are used and from which external pages users find their way to us. We also want to learn about which pages are viewed, how often, how long the page takes to display in your browser and how much time is spent viewing a page, so that we can identify errors and further improve Gameforge services.<br>
            <br>
            For these purposes we use tools such as Google Analytics described in section 3.5.1 below. The Gameforge pages also use a variety of cookies for these purposes, explained in more detail in section 3.6 and in our Cookie Policy.<br>

            This data is processed in pursuit of our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) in the optimisation and smooth operation of Gameforge services and fulfilling the contracts with our partners.

            In order to optimise Gameforge services and especially the online games for a better user experience, we would like to understand how our services are used and whether optimisations and new functions are successfully accepted.<br>
            <br>
            For example, to determine if a new quest is in need of optimisation, we could measure how many users have already accepted this quest and within what time it was completed, or which quest phases took longer to complete. We can also test which item description for shop items leads to greater popularity among users. Similarly, the number of clicks on a link to an information page and the length of time spent on that page can help us determine whether the page in question is necessary or needs to be improved.<br>
            <br>
            As a rule, the relevant information is aggregated so that we can extrapolate results from the collection of individual data points, which in most cases cannot be traced back to individual users.<br>
            <br>
            When information is not aggregated, your data is generally processed in a pseudonymised form. In certain cases, we may display personalised offers, i.e. adapted to the needs of the individual user, based on individual usage behaviour. It is possible, for example, to offer appropriate equipment items to a user who prefers PvP combat or to hide less interesting quests for a user who prefers a particular type of quest.

            Gameforge websites make use of cookies. The Gameforge websites use a cookie banner, which informs you about our use of cookies when visiting our internet pages, and links to our Cookie Policy which contains further information about our cookies.<br>
            <br>
            When you open Gameforge websites in your browser, cookies are saved to your system for their respective lifespans. They are not executable applications and do not contain any elements that can cause damage; instead they hold a sequence of characters relevant to their function. Simply put, cookies are small text files in which information in connection to the opened website is saved.<br>
            <br>
            It is through this that certain functions on Gameforge internet pages are made possible. Cookies allow your browser to be recognised when revisiting the site, for instance, making it easier and more secure to log into a Gameforge account, and allowing settings you choose, such as the display language or screen size and orientation in a browser game, to be loaded automatically. Cookies enable us to present Gameforge websites to you in a functional and user-friendly format and in a manner that suits your requirements.<br>
            <br>
            Alongside these technically-required and useful functions (necessary cookies and functionality cookies), cookies also enable us to collect and analyse data regarding the use of Gameforge’s websites (analysis cookies). This allows us to see how frequently a Gameforge website is visited, how often specific page functions are used, or whether and at what stage errors occur (performance cookies).<br>
            <br>
            Cookies are also used to deliver interest-targeted advertisements (advertising cookies). The information associated with Gameforge cookies is generally saved in a pseudonymised form however, which prevents us from linking it directly to an individual user without the enlistment of further information.<br>
            <br>
            In addition to our cookies (first-party cookies), cookies from third-party providers (third-party cookies) may also be set. For more information regarding these cookies, we recommend you read the data protection policies of their respective providers.<br>
            <br>
            Cookies will be automatically removed from your system regularly, once you leave Gameforge websites or if you end your session by logging out (session cookies). Some cookies may, however, remain stored on your system. To prevent this, you can change your browser settings to block all cookies, permit only specific cookies, or delete all stored cookies completely when the browser is closed. If you wish to make use of these settings, please follow the respective directions provided by your browser. Please note, however, that for technical reasons visiting the Gameforge websites with such settings may make them partially or wholly inoperable, or otherwise limit the service provided.<br>

We do not only send contract-related messages to this address, but also information about Gameforge, new online games in our portfolio or adjustments to existing Gameforge services at regular intervals. In order to send you a suitable newsletter, we also use information such as the online game you are using and the account name you have chosen. In aggregated form, we record how often our newsletter has been read and which links contained therein have been opened. This information cannot be used to identify individual users.<br>

For security reasons, always check incoming emails to see whether we have sent the message in question. If you have any concerns or questions, please contact our support department.<br>
            <br>
            If you do not wish to receive such a newsletter, you can object to the use of your email address for these purposes by clicking on a link contained in each of our newsletters. You do not incur any costs for cancelling the newsletter. This does not apply to any amounts invoiced to you by your internet provider. Further information on your right to object can also be found in section 6.5.<br>
            <br>
            The use of your email address for the purpose of sending the newsletter, and sending the email itself, takes place on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR and Section 7(3) of the Act Against Unfair Competition.<br>
            <br>
            Furthermore, Gameforge services can make it easier for you to recommend the respective service by copying a text provided by us to your clipboard which you can customise and paste into the email program of your choice. You can then enter the address of the recipient you have selected and send the message to them. We do not collect your email address or that of the recipient.

Following the entry of a Gameforge-related search term or after calling up a Gameforge internet page, you may encounter customised advertisements on external internet pages.

            <br>
            If an additional application is installed on the user’s system during the installation of client software, we will inform you of this in a transparent manner during the installation process. The installation can be aborted, which means that the relevant security application will not be installed. It is also possible to uninstall the respective application together with the game client at any time. However, for technical and economic reasons the use of the online game protected in this way cannot then be offered. Once it is successfully installed, the application runs together with the online game and checks the game-related processes and the integrity of the game files during runtime. No further search or monitoring of the system takes place. If an attempted rule violation is detected, it can either be logged and later sanctioned or immediately ended. This is connected with the Gameforge account used for the violation being deregistered and blocked according to the rules specified by us and generally leads to the termination of the relevant user contract. This may also include the detection and blocking of connected Gameforge accounts. The related processing of personal data such as the collection of IP addresses, hardware information and gaming activities, as well as account information, is generally carried out by us. If we commission an external service provider for this, it is done in accordance with the legal requirements and with strict respect for your rights. In addition, we point this out to you transparently during the installation of the relevant online game.<br>
            <br>
            We also use server-side software solutions that detect inadmissible logins and fraud attempts on the Gameforge internet pages and block them according to rules specified by us. If actions of this kind are detected, this can also lead to the blocking of the Gameforge account used and associated user accounts or to the blocking of certain functions as well as to the termination of the respective user contract. The commission of an external service provider is done in accordance with the legal requirements and with strict respect for your rights.<br>
            <br>
            In addition, affected users are free to contact us at any time concerning a decision taken based on the protective measures. We will carefully examine the relevant details and inform you promptly of a final decision based on the respective facts and will justify this decision in a transparent manner.

            As a rule, your data is passed on internally to the department responsible for the respective processing, which is then processed only by the employee(s) responsible. For example, we can forward a complaint received by post to the responsible support employee. Our employees are trained in the field of data protection, are bound by obligations of confidentiality and data privacy, and are committed by company guidelines and instructions to handle your data in accordance with legal requirements and the contents of this Privacy Policy.<br>
            <br>
            For technical, legal or business reasons it may also be necessary in certain cases to pass your data on to third parties. For instance, it may be necessary that we forward your data to a company associated with us as per Section 15 of the German Stock Corporation Act (currently Gameforge AG and Palado GmbH, both reachable at the address provided above) for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy. For example, our financial accounting, legal department and group data protection are organisationally affiliated to our parent company (Gameforge AG).<br>
            <br>
            Furthermore, carefully selected service companies make their data centres available to us for sending our newsletter and integrating payment methods. We also work with service providers who enable us to assess the success of an advertising campaign or support us in avoiding fraud attempts and breaches of the rules. Should it be required by law, we also forward data to the relevant authorities to the necessary extent. In as far as we require external advice from third parties, in particular legal advice, for the purposes of enforcing or defending legal claims, we may also transfer the necessary data to these recipients.<br>
            <br>
            Any transfer is performed exclusively for the purposes detailed in this Privacy Policy with the greatest attention and under strict adherence to the legal provisions, in particular the conclusion of an agreement for processing data by contract as per Article 28(3) sentence 1 of the GDPR.

            Before any personal data is transferred, we check first of all whether the legal requirements for the transfer in question are met. This includes ensuring that we only forward personal data to recipients who can guarantee a sufficiently high level of protection for personal data. For this reason, we only transfer data to recipients in third countries (see section 3) when this level of protection for personal data is provided in the country. This is the case where the European Commission has made a decision confirming the country in question meets the standards of data adequacy. Such a level of data adequacy may also be present when a service provider from the United States of America is certified according to the EU-US Privacy Shield, or the transfer is concluded on the basis of the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses.

            In this section, we explain how long we store the personal data we collect.<br>
            <br>
            We do not retain personal data without purpose. Any data we store is done for a specific purpose and is bound to this purpose. The length of time data is retained is primarily linked to the basic purpose and necessity of storing it. Personal data is therefore only stored in as far as it is required for a specific purpose.<br>
            <br>
            When determining the retention period, we first check whether it is necessary to store the relevant data for the entire term of a contract with the persons concerned. This is particularly the case with basic information such as the registered email address. In individual cases, such as in the case of forum posts, storage may also take place in addition to this for information reasons.<br>
            <br>
            If such permanent storage is not required, we will check the minimum storage period specifically required for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. Complaints and support requests, as well as usage data that may result in a rule violation, are stored until it is no longer necessary for asserting, enforcing or defending legal claims or for further support cases. Our standard is the regular statute of limitations of three years in accordance with Section 195 of the German Civil Code. If the data need only be saved for technical reasons for a short time (for example, during your current session), this data will only be stored for the period of use and a maximum of 30 days.<br>
            <br>
            Finally, we check whether any legal retention periods apply, particularly in terms of taxation law (Section 147(3) of the Fiscal Code of Germany) or commercial law (Section 257(4) of the German Commercial Code), which may for example require documents to be stored for a period of six to ten years.<br>
            <br>
            If there is no cause to process the data, the data is no longer required for this purpose, and there are no legal requirements to store the data, we delete it.

            You are free to contact us in your preferred way to exercise your rights set out here (see section 1 for details). As we do not collect any plaintext data such as your name or address, and we can only establish your identification via the email address you have linked to your Gameforge account, we recommend that when registering for ticket support, you use the email address of your Gameforge account or link this address to your support account. This ensures that your issue can be dealt with quickly and in an uncomplicated manner. Inform the support team of your concern. Alternatively, you can contact our data protection officer in confidence using your email address. For an uncomplicated assignment, please explain the matter to us as precisely as possible in all cases. If possible, please indicate in particular the online game you are using, the language version, the game server and your account name.

            In handling personal data, we have made appropriate technical and organisational measures to maintain data security and reduce the risks to the rights and freedoms of the affected persons. This includes the fact that we do not collect any real names or addresses and that we maintain the respective Gameforge accounts using pseudonyms. We also limit the personal data collected and stored to the required minimum, and encrypt it where possible.
