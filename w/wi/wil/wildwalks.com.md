## Privacy

##### Your Privacy

Wildwalks aims to comply with the Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998 (NSW), which regulates the collection, storage, quality, use and disclosure of personal information.

**Wildwalks App subscriptions**

To help us continue making this app awesome and to allow us to continue to add more wonderful walks we charge users to access longer walks in this app. 

There are two subscriptions length options Monthly or Annual. Once subscribed you get unlimited access to all the information on the walks displayed in the app. You can then download the maps, photos and tracknotes so that the app will work offline.    
The current price of each subscription is available on the updates page and is displayed in Australian dollars. Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.  Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.  Your Itunes account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period at the same price. Your subscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to your Itunes Account Settings after purchase.
