Use of Cookies

For example, if you personalize Wilcom International Pty Ltd pages, or register with Wilcom International Pty Ltd site or services, a cookie helps Wilcom International Pty Ltd to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Wilcom International Pty Ltd services or Web sites you visit.
