### Frequently Asked Questions

**Our online store supplies you with a secure session within our shopping 'checkout' process. All credit card numbers are encrypted when the order is placed using 128 bit SSL encryption and we do not have access to these details. You can see at which point the shopping cart encrypts your information by the little yellow padlock that appears in the lower right corner of your browser. Your credit card numbers, personal information and order information are only decrypted after they reach our order processing computers. This information is not held in clear text on any website or server. You will notice a padlock icon on the base of your browser when you enter through to the 'checkout'. This indicates that all information entered in the session is secure.
