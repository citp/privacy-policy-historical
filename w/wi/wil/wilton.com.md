**Is it safe to make online purchases from Wilton?**  
Yes. We have made data security a priority. When a purchase is made or when personal information is provided to us, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that your information is encrypted. This means that no one else can read it while it is being transmitted over the Internet. SSL is regarded as the industry standard among encryption technologies. It is among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. 

**What do you do with my information?**  
Simply put, we use your information to serve you better. Wilton is committed to quality customer experience.
