  1. **PURPOSE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY**
    1. This Privacy Policy sets out the ways and the manner in which, we, the Operator, may collect and use personal information that we may obtain about You.
    2. In Gibraltar, we are a registered Data Controller under the Gibraltar Data Protection Act 2004. Details of our registration can be found in the Gibraltar Regulatory Authority public register of data controllers at <http://www.gra.gi/data-protection>by searching for "William Hill". Our Gibraltar Gambling Commissioner registration number for the purposes of data protection is DP005080.
    3. We ask that You read this Privacy Policy carefully as it contains important information about what to expect as to how we collect and use personal information about You.
    4. Unless the context otherwise requires, capitalised terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall be as defined in the General Terms, which, for the avoidance of doubt, also apply and You will need to read and understand the General Terms in addition to this Privacy Policy.
  2. **WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION**
    1. Your personal data (meaning any information about You from which You can be personally identified, such as Your name, address, telephone number or email address, and which is referred to in this Privacy Policy as " **Your Information** "), will be processed by us (including any of our agents and/or employees), and (where appropriate) any other company in our company Group and/or our partners and subcontractors, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    2. By registering as a user of our Services (or by partially completing the registration form), using the Services, otherwise using the Website, or submitting a query to us via the Website or by telephone, You acknowledge that You have read and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and that You consent to the use of Your Information by us and (where appropriate) any other company in our company Group and/or our partners and subcontractors, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    3. If You do not wish to provide Your Information on the basis set out in this Privacy Policy, You should not enter the relevant information in the spaces provided on any relevant part of our Website, or provide any of Your Information to us by telephone or otherwise. However, if You do not provide such information, You may not be permitted or able to make full use of the relevant part of the Services.
    4. If at any time You wish us to stop processing Your Information for any of the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, then You must contact us and we will take the appropriate steps to stop doing so. Please note that this may mean that Your Account will have to be closed.
    5. Please note that while the Services may contain links to websites and applications operated by parties other than us (for example the Gibraltar Gambling Commissioner's website), we (and/or any other company in our company Group) are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any such websites or applications.
    6. As part of the account registration process, we also offer visitors registering with us the opportunity to " [opt out](https://web.archive.org/unsubscribe)" from keeping them informed of future events, offers and promotions from us (and any other company in our company Group). Visitors who wish to take the option should 'untick' the relevant box in the registration process. You may update Your marketing preferences at any time through 'My Account/Update Marketing Preferences' (where available) or by contacting Customer [24/7 Services](https://web.archive.org/support).
