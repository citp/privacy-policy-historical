  * We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system. 
  * While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our Sites reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.

  * We employ physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of any personally identifiable information. 



### LENGTH OF TIME WE KEEP INFORMATION

  * We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives for as long as we reasonably need it (for instance, for taxation or insurance purposes or in case orders may give rise to claims). 
  * We may alter this practice according to changing requirements. For example, we may delete some data, if needed, to free up storage space. We may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it. 
  * In addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain indefinitely.
