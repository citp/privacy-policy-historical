# Privacy Policy | Wickes.co.uk

When you shop with Wickes or visit our website, you trust us with your information. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect and how we use it.

Wickes is committed to protecting your privacy and complying with the data protection laws in the United Kingdom. This Privacy Policy, together with our Cookies Policy, explains how we use any information we collect about you and forms part of our Conditions of Website Use.

Any payments made via PayPal will be subject to the [PayPal Privacy Policy](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full).

#### Information we collect from you and how we use it

We will collect information about you when you:

  * **Buy or return things in store**
  * **Use our click and collect or delivery services**
  * **Shop online (either as a guest or using your account)**
  * **Enter a competition**
  * **Sign up for news and offers**



#### How do we use the information we collect about you?

We may use the information provided by you in a variety of ways, including:

  * To answer your questions or provide you with information you have requested
  * To process your order or manage your account
  * To help with any questions if you have started an order but not completed it
  * To provide a more personalised online experience by showing you the most relevant products and offers 
  * To keep track of sales and enquiries
  * To monitor how our customers transact with us in store and online, for example by checking who has redeemed vouchers or bought items using our mobile app, website or other facility (for more information see Understanding Our Customers below)
  * To contact you for your views on our products and services
  * To keep you informed about the products and services that we offer (for more information on your choices see Keeping You Informed below)
  * For market research purposes, by tracking activity on our site or in store (on an anonymous basis) to identify trends and/or to improve usefulness and content
  * To notify you about important changes or developments to our site or services



We only retain your information for a limited period in order to respond to your query, provide you with the information you require or to send you updates on our products and services for as long as you indicate that you are happy for us to do so. We are required to keep some records for a longer period of time to meet our legal obligations.

#### Understanding Our Customers

So that we can provide a better service, we want to understand the shopping patterns of our customers, how customers select the products and services they ultimately buy, which apps and technology customers prefer to use, and how successful our advertising and promotional campaigns have been. We may use a number of different techniques to do this:

  * We never see or store your payment card details. We do use a unique encrypted token that can tell the same payment card is used in different places (in store, online or on the Wickes app). This helps us build a complete picture of all the things people buy from Wickes
  * We monitor which customers redeem vouchers using a code that makes the offer personal to you
  * When you order goods in store to be delivered, we will ask for your marketing choices as we would like to send you information about other products and services that may be of interest. We may also link your in-store order details with your online account information and your shopping patterns on our website and mobile app so we have a complete picture of all the things you buy from Wickes
  * We may monitor other websites you visit and the goods and services you look for using search engines in order to provide you with information about products and services from Wickes which are most relevant to you
  * We may connect with social media sites so that we can better target our advertising while you are using these services and improve the relevance of what you see



We also use cookies to track online activity. You can find out more about this in our Cookies Policy. The information collected by cookies does not in itself identify a visitor to our site but if you are a customer or account holder we may be able to identify you from both sets of information combined.

Wickes is part of the Travis Perkins Group. We never make your personal details available to companies outside of the Travis Perkins Group for their own marketing purposes.

However, we may use other companies to provide services to you on our behalf. These services may include but are not limited to answering your questions about products or services, sending postal mail, texts and emails and analysing data. We will only provide those companies with the information they need to deliver the service we have engaged them for and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

We may have to disclose your information by law or because a court or the police or other law enforcement agency has asked us for it. In the event that a majority of our shares are bought by another company or we transfer a substantial amount of our assets to another company, we may disclose your personal information to that purchaser.

#### How is your information protected

We take protection of your information seriously and have appropriate physical and technological security measures in place to keep it safe. For further details please see our Security Online section. Internally, we restrict access to personal information. Only employees who need the information in order to do their jobs have access to it. Your information will be stored in Europe and will not be transferred to any other country.

#### Changes to our privacy policy

We keep our Privacy Policy under regular review and if we change our Privacy Policy we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect and how we use it. This policy was last updated in July 2016.

This website is operated by Wickes Building Supplies Limited. You may request details of the personal information that we hold about you. If you would like a copy of it, please email us. A small fee may be payable.

We want to make sure that your personal information is accurate and up to date. Therefore, if you think any information we hold about you is incorrect or incomplete, please email or write to us as soon as possible so we can update our records. If you have set up an account you can always update your details in the account settings.
