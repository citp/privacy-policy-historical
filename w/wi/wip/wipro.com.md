Wipro takes your privacy very seriously 

In general, you can visit Wipro's websites without telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need information from you. 

Wipro does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 

  1. We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Wipro under extremely strict confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Wipro communicate with you about offers from Wipro and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. 
  2. We have a parent's permission to share the information if the user is a child under age 13. 
  3. We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; 
  4. We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law. 
  5. We transfer information about you if Wipro is acquired by or merged with another company.
