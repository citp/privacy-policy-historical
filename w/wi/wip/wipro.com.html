<p>In general, you can visit Wipro's websites without telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need information from you. </p>
<p>Wipro does not share personal information about you with non-affiliated companies except: (a) to provide products or services you've requested; (b) when we have your permission: or (c) under the following circumstances: </p>
<ul class="normal">
<li>We provide the information to trusted entities who work on behalf of or with Wipro under strict confidentiality agreements. These entities may use your personal information to help Wipro communicate with you about offers from Wipro and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to further share or disseminate this information; </li>
<li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; </li>
<li>We believe it is necessary to share the information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action against any illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law. </li>
<li>We believe it is necessary to share the information in order to protect or enforce Wipro's rights, usage terms, intellectual or physical property or for safety of Wipro or associated parties.</li>
<li>We may share information about you if Wipro is acquired by or merged with another company. </li>
</ul>

<p>You may choose to give us personal information such as your name and address or e-mail identification address ('ID') that may be needed, for example, to correspond with you, for you to download our white papers, to provide you with subscription information etc. We intend to protect the quality and integrity of your personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Wipro will not be liable to any unsolicited information provided by you. You consent to Wipro using such information as per Wipro's privacy policy.</p>
<p>We will make a sincere effort to respond in a timely manner to your requests to correct inaccuracies in your personal information. To correct inaccuracies in your personal information, please return the message containing the inaccuracies to the sender. </p>

<h5>Cookies and other technologies</h5>
<p>We sometimes collect anonymous information from visits to our sites to help us provide better customer service.

Wipro or its affiliates or vendors may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service. We maintain the highest levels of confidentiality for this information. Our affiliates and vendors follow the same high levels of confidentiality.

<h5>Anti-Spam policy </h5>
<p>Wipro recognizes the receipt, transmission or distribution of spam emails (i.e. unsolicited bulk emails) as a major concern and has taken reasonable measures to minimize the transmission and effect of spam emails in our computing environment. All emails received by Wipro are subject to spam check. Any email identified as spam will be rejected with sufficient information to the sender for taking necessary action. With this measure, along with other technical spam reduction measures, Wipro hopes to minimize the effect of spam emails. Wipro reserves the right to reject and/or report any suspicious spam emails, to the authorities concerned, for necessary action.</p>
