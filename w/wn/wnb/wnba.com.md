# WNBA.com: NBA.com Network Privacy Policy

Here at the NBA.com network of web sites (NBA.com, WNBA.com and NBDL.com, collectively referred to hereinafter as “NBA.com”), we are committed to safeguarding your privacy online. We want to assure our users that NBA.com will not willfully disclose any specific individual information about you to any third party unless you give us permission to do so. 

NBA.com does not solicit any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Accordingly, children under 13 years old may be restricted from participating in certain activities and transactions on NBA.com (including the NBA/WNBA Store on NBA.com at store.nba.com). NBA.com works with (and may provide links to) third party sites that offer features described on NBA.com (e.g., official fantasy games, chat rooms, message boards, vendors, registration for camps and clinics). Such third parties may permit children under the age of 13 to register for these features on their sites in accordance with their respective privacy policies. However, NBA.com does not knowingly obtain, retain or use information from anyone who indicates that they are under 13 years old. If you would like more information about NBA.com's policy for collecting information from children, please read our [Note to Parents](https://web.archive.org/news/privacy_policy.html#note) below.

Please read this Privacy Policy ("Policy") for an explanation of how we will treat your personal information. By using any site within NBA.com, including any of the Official Team Sites of the National Basketball Association ("NBA"), the Women’s National Basketball Association (“WNBA”) and the National Basketball Development League (“NBDL”) and the NBA Store/WNBA Store on NBA.com, you consent to the collection and use of personal information as outlined in this Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use our site. Your use of any site within NBA.com indicates your acceptance of such Policy and of the collection and use of your personal information in accordance therewith. 

If we make any material changes to the Policy, those changes will be posted here so that you are always aware of what personal information is collected, how that information is used, and under what circumstances that information may be disclosed. Since this Policy may change from time to time, you should check back periodically. Your continued use of NBA.com following the posting of changes to the Policy will signal your acceptance of such changes.

**1\. What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the site**

As stated above, NBA.com does not solicit any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Please review our [Note to Parents](https://web.archive.org/news/privacy_policy.html#note), if you have any questions regarding our Policy with respect to children. 

NBA.com does not collect personally identifiable information through the site unless you provide that information during registration for various features on the site (e.g., site registration, newsletters, purchases on the NBA/WNBA Store on NBA.com, etc.). Information required to participate in such features may vary but will typically include your first and last name; address including city, state, zip code and country; complete date of birth; and e-mail address; and, in the case of making purchases, a credit card number and expiration date. You may also be requested to provide a username and password for certain features. NBA.com will maintain all of the personal information submitted by you in secured servers behind corporate firewalls.

**2\. The organization collecting the information**

The NBA.com and NBDL.com web sites are operated by NBA Media Ventures, LLC (“NBAMV”). The WNBA.com web site is operated by WNBA Enterprises, LLC (“WNBAE”). NBAMV and WNBAE are located at 450 Harmon Meadow Boulevard, Secaucus, New Jersey, 07094. Please contact [FanRelations@NBA.com](mailto:fanrelations@nba.com) for more information. You can also learn more about any of the teams of the NBA, WNBA or NBDL by referring to their respective Official Web Sites located within the NBA.com network. 

**3\. How the information is used**

NBA.com and its affiliates may use information provided by you or information obtained through third parties to offer better targeted products and services to you. We use targeting to customize and enhance your online experience on the site. Such information will not be provided to advertisers or partners, except in aggregate form, without your consent. An NBA.com user may change or update his or her personal information at any time by visiting the registration area. 

NBA.com uses "cookie" technology. Cookies are pieces of information transferred to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Such technology is an industry standard and is used by most major Web sites. In order to effectively use the site and some of its features (e.g., site registration, NBA/WNBA Store on NBA.com), your browser must accept cookies. 

Users should be aware that NBA.com cannot control the use of cookies (or the resulting use of information obtained from cookies) by advertisers or third parties that host or provide data, content and services for NBA.com. If a user does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept cookies; however, users should note that cookies may be necessary to provide the user with certain features (e.g., site registration) available on NBA.com. 

NBA.com tracks certain general usage pattern information, including what pages people visit and how long they have been registered users. NBA.com may log users' IP addresses (the group of four numbers separated by periods, such as 123.45.64.89, that identifies a particular host computer) for the purposes of system administration, site tracking and reporting of aggregate usage information to our marketing and product development teams. 

From time to time, NBA.com may solicit your opinion to determine your preferences and dislikes in order to provide you with a better product. These surveys are always optional to the user and your decision not to participate in a survey will not affect your status as an NBA.com user. Should you choose to participate, any information you give us may be used in aggregate form for marketing purposes, to enhance your overall experience on our site and for other authorized purposes. 

**4\. With whom the information may be shared**

Once again, NBA.com and its affiliates will not provide any personally identifiable information about you to advertisers or other partners without your consent. All third parties with whom we share such information will have independent privacy and data collection practices and NBA.com has no responsibility or liability for their policies or actions.

NBA.com has several partners that can offer valuable products and services to our members. From time to time, NBA.com may give or sell a list from our database of users to these third parties. These lists will consist of only those users that have consented to receiving information, special offers and promotions. In addition, your information may be provided to a company that acquires all or substantially all of NBA.com's assets or in a merger or acquisition. You will be notified of any such transaction and advised of any change in the applicable privacy policy.

While NBA.com is careful in choosing its partners and advertisers, we are only responsible for content on our own sites. All third parties associated with NBA.com (including, but not limited to, advertisers, sponsors and other Internet sites) with whom we share information have independent privacy and data collection practices. NBA.com does not control this collection of information and is neither responsible nor liable for their policies or actions. 

NBA.com uses DoubleClick, a reputable third party vendor, to serve the advertisements that you see on the pages of our site. If you would like to know more about the information gathering practices and "opt-out" procedures of our third party ad server, please [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/). 

**5\. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information**

You are not required to receive any mailings that you do not wish to receive. During the registration process, you will have the option to sign up to receive newsletters, selected sponsor offers, discounts and other promotions. Users will receive such information as a result of their use of NBA.com only with their consent. If, after you choose to receive such information, you wish to discontinue receiving these items, you may change your preferences by visiting the registration area or by indicating your preference by following the instructions that may be provided within the e-mails received. If a username and password is required to access the feature, you will need to provide such information to update your registration preferences. If you have forgotten your password, you may obtain it by visiting the registration area and requesting it to be sent to you at the e-mail address you originally provided during registration. 

**6\. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control**

NBA.com has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under its control. The servers for NBA.com are stored in a physically secure and climate controlled off-site facility. Beyond the physical protection of the servers, we protect against data loss by backing up data, performing consistency checks, and restricting access to information on our servers. Our site uses SSL or "Secure Sockets Layer", an industry standard security protocol. In addition, only those trained employees needed to carry out the business functions will have access to information on individual NBA.com customers. 

It is important to remember that whatever you transmit or disclose online can be collected and used by others or unlawfully intercepted by third parties. No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. In addition, we may disclose information to law enforcement or other government officials and if asked to disclose it by subpoena, court order or other legal process. 

Your site membership account is password protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. At no time will any NBA.com employee ask for your password via e-mail. If you ever receive such an inquiry, please notify NBA.com immediately at [FanRelations@NBA.com](mailto:fanrelations@nba.com). Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your screen names, passwords and/or other account information.

Any information voluntarily disclosed by users and posted on our site (on message boards and/or in chat areas) may be viewed and used by others. If users post personal information that is accessible to the public online, the user does so at his or her own risk. Users accept that they may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. 

**7\. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information**

You will also have the option to correct any inaccuracies in your site membership account or other registration by returning to the registration area and updating your profile and preferences. If a username and password is required to access the feature, you will need to provide such information to update your registration information. If you have forgotten your password, you may obtain it by visiting the registration area and requesting it to be sent to you at the e-mail address you originally provided during registration.

 **NBA.COM NOTE TO PARENTS**

It is NBA.com's policy not to solicit any personally identifiable information from children. A number of interactive features on NBA.com require registration to participate (e.g., e-mail newsletters, site registration). All registrants will be required to enter their full name, age, zip code and e-mail address. In some cases, users will be required to select a special user name to be used as an identifier for the feature and must also enter a password and a secret hint that will help us verify their identity if they forget their password. If NBA.com determines that a person is under the age of 13, based on the information provided during the registration process, that person will not be permitted to register for features requiring the submission of personal information, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Instead, when a child under 13 years old tries to register for such features on NBA.com, he or she will be directed to content which does not involve the submission of personal information. Children who indicate that they are under 13 years old will not be able to make credit card purchases or participate in interactive features on NBA.com that involve the collection and retention of personal information (e.g., entering a sweepstakes) and they will not be contacted about special offers or promotions. 

NBA.com works with (and may provide links to) third party sites that offer features described on NBA.com. Such third parties may permit children under the age of 13 to register for these features on their sites in accordance with their respective privacy policies. Features that permit registration by children under 13 years old include official fantasy games (e.g., Virtual GM) of the NBA or WNBA hosted by ESPN.com and chat rooms hosted by Yahoo.com. Registration for these features is pursuant to the privacy policies of the third parties operating the web sites on which registration occurs. For more information, please review the privacy policies of each respective third party site. NBA.com does not knowingly obtain, retain or use information from anyone who indicates that they are under 13 years old.
