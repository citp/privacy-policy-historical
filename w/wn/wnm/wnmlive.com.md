### Location Data Collection

In order to use the Nearby Services, we need to associate your account with a geographic location. In order to do this, we will utilize the GPS and/or cellular antenna of your mobile device to find your approximate location. We may also utilize your IP Address to determine where you are. Your latitude and longitude coordinate pair will be utilized to determine the city and political region that you are currently in. This information will be posted publically when you use the Nearby service. If you would like to opt-out of sharing your actual geographic location, you can visit the Account Settings page of www.wnmlive.com and override your location with a false one. Location data will be treated as any other personally identifiable collected in regards to our policy on sharing such information with third parties. Even if you opt-out of sharing your location data publically with other users, please note that SynergeTech Solutions will still collect your location data and may still share it with third parties to enable us to run the Nearby properties.

### Data Use and Sharing

The nature of the Nearby service is that most information you give us will be shared with any other user, or even anonymous visitor, of the Nearby service.  This includes your profile details, Live Stream posts, photos, and general location.  You can block specific users from accessing this data.  Private messages between you and a single other user will not be shared by the Nearby service, but could be shared by the other participant.

There are also a few ways we share your data in order to help enhance the service, and specifically drive user interaction.  For instance, we may choose to use your user content (including your profile, posts, or photos) to market the Nearby service.  This could include, without limitation, screenshots for the App Store or promotional emails to current or potential users.

### No Sale of Personal Data Collected

We are not in the business of selling any of your personal data to any other individual or company and such a sale would never take place.  We do not sell, rent, or lease our customer list to third parties, although we may sell, rent, or lease access to such users with the user's explicit permission. We may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, we may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to our company and users, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.  We also reserve the right to pass along all the data we have collected in the event of a merger or acquistion of our company in order to facilitate the continued operation of the service.

### Service Monitoring

During normal course of business our employees, sub-contractors, agents, and affiliates will never review your private communications or other personal data.  We do however reserve the right to do so when there is a clear and obvious need to do so.  An example of such a situation would be to verify reports of harrassment or to investigate service interuptions or issues.  In the event that it is neccessary to review private personal data, such data will only be viewed by individuals under a strict non-disclosure agreement with our company to protect disclosure beyond our company.
