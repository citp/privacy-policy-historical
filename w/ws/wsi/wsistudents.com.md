The term "personal data" as used in this Policy refers to information such as your name, e-mail address or mailing address, or any data that can be used to identify you. We ensure that our staff and those acting on our behalf obtain, use and disclose personal information lawfully and correctly.

In compliance with the Spanish Personal Data Protection Act (“Ley Orgánica de Protección de Datos Personales”), FSS informs you about the existence of an automated data file for which FSS assumes sole responsibility.

The purpose of the collection and processing of personal data from this website is twofold: to provide you with information on new services offered by this website; and to send you commercial information on products or services that may interest you.

In order to use our services, users may be asked to fill in a form, which requires providing certain personal information to FSS. Unless otherwise provided in those fields expressly marked with an asterisk (*), answers to our questions on personal data are not mandatory. Not supplying the information required in such optional fields shall not represent any decrease of the services and information that we may provide you. However, failure to complete those compulsory fields or providing incorrect personal data shall prevent us from providing the requested information or services.

FSS informs you about the possibility of exercising your rights to access, amend, cancel and object to the processing of your personal data simply by making a written request to FRANCHISE SUPPORT & SERVICES, Tuset, 20-24, 5th Floor - 08006 Barcelona - Spain, Attention Privacy Controller or to our electronic mail address [privacy@wallstreetinstitute.com](mailto:privacy@wallstreetinstitute.com).

This Privacy Policy applies only to this website, excluding third party websites. We may provide links to other websites, which we believe may be of interest to our visitors. We aim at ensuring that such websites are of the highest standard. However, due to the nature of the World Wide Web, we cannot guarantee the standards of every linked website or be responsible for their content.
