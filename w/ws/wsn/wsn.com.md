  1.     1. a.How we use Cookies


  1.     1.       1. i.The Site makes use of cookies and other technologies to assist in recording non-personal statistical information such as how much time is spent reading the content of a certain page, or which banner advertisements receive the most clicks by our users. Such technologies help us improve our Site, our marketing activities and your experience. Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Site. By using or accessing the Site, you are consenting to the Site’s use of cookies as explained further in this Clause 6.



  1.     1.       1. ii.Cookies are essentially text-only pieces of information that the Site transfers to your hard drive or other website browsing equipment for record-keeping purposes.



  1.     1.       1. iii.While information collected through cookies gives us no personal data (therefore it does not collect matters such as your name and surname) it does allow us to serve adverts and other content, which, based on the information stored by the cookie, may be of interest to you. This can include articles, customised advertisements and targeted services. Cookies therefore are used to improve your online experience, as well as for analytics and for marketing, but specifically we use Cookies on the Site for the purposes highlighted in the table at Clause 6(d) below.



  1.     1.       1. iv.Where we hold personal data about you (such as where it is provided to us during account creation) we may combine information received from cookies to your account profile.




You can disable cookies in your browser at any time, however this will reduce the value you can gain in terms of being useful and interesting content. It will also cancel any browser customisations you may have put in place. Removing cookies may also have the effect of removing your opt-out preferences from certain sites that use cookies to record opt-outs/unsubscribe preferences.
