**Information We Collect** Personal Data is any information that can be used to identify a specific individual, such as your name, email address, home address or phone number. We collect Personal Data whenever you visit the Site to, for example, register for certain services on-line; agree to participate in on-line surveys; request certain on-line information from us; participate in chat rooms, blogs or other user forums; or participate in on-line contests and promotions sponsored by us. We also may collect information when you register for wireless services via your mobile phone or other wireless devices. Because participation in these activities is completely voluntary, the user has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The type of information requested or collected by us includes user contact information (such as name and email address) and user demographic information (like gender or age). 

Aggregate and anonymous data is information that does not identify you specifically including data collected automatically through operation of the Site (AA Data). Like many sites, the Site makes use of browser "cookies" or other similar technologies to collect AA Data. Cookies are files written to a user's hard disk and read by the server programs to inform a website if the user has previously visited that site. We use cookies to improve your user experience by delivering content specific to your interests, saving your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our sites, tracking progress and number of entries in activities that require registration or entry, such as sweepstakes and for other purposes. You can set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when cookies are being used, but it is possible that some parts of the Site will not function properly if you do so. 

**Our Use of Your Information**

We will use your Personal Data for the purposes for which it was provided. For example, if you provided Personal Data to enter a contest or sweepstakes, we will use it to register you and will use your contact information to notify contest winners and award prizes. We may also use your Personal Data to provide you with information about features, services and other offerings that may be of interest to you. Cookies and similar tools may be used to relate your use of the Site and AA Data to Personal Data obtained from you. If any AA Data is linked with Personal Data, the linked AA Data will then be treated as Personal Data. 

AA Data collected through surveys will be used for purposes of reporting survey results and monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. We may also use Personal Data in aggregate form for purposes of research or analysis. In order to better understand and serve users of the Site, we often conduct research on customer demographics, interests and behavior based on Personal Data we gather. Although this aggregated data may be based in part on Personal Data, it does not identify you personally. We may share this type of AA Data with a variety of third parties, including affiliates, agents and current and prospective business partners. 

We use AA Data collected from the Site for site administration, advertising and promotional purposes, and we may share such information with various third parties. For example, IP addresses are used to administer the Site and to provide AA Data to advertisers about the volume of use on the Site. We track and record IP addresses that access our site for reporting and profiling purposes only. We also gather anonymous browsing habits of our visitors to better identify content preferences. Clickstream data and demographic AA Data may be shared with our advertisers and business partners.

When we hire a third party to perform these functions, that third party will only be provided with the Personal Data it needs to perform its function, and is required to afford the same level of protection to your Personal Data. We may also share Personal Data with pre-screened third parties for their marketing or promotional purposes. If you prefer that we not share your Personal Data in this way, you may opt-out of such sharing by contacting us at webmaster@wsvn.com.
