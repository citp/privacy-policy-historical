**Cookies and Similar Technologies**

We use cookies and similar technologies to enhance and customize your experience on the Sites and for analytics.  We also use cookies and similar technologies for purposes of marketing and advertising, including interest-based advertising.

A “cookie” is a small text file that a web server stores in browser software.  A browser sends cookies to a server when the browser makes a connection to the server (for example, when requesting a web page from the same domain that created the cookie). The purpose of cookies is to remember the browser over time and distinguish one browser instance (or user) from all others.  Some cookies and other technologies may serve to track Personal Information previously entered by a web user on our Site. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them, and how to remove them. Cookies can remember login information, preferences, and similar information.

Cookies, as well as other tracking technologies such as HTML5 local storage, and Local Shared Objects (such as “Flash” cookies), and similar mechanisms, may record information such as a unique identifier, information you enter in a form, IP address, and other categories of data.

We also use web beacons or “pixels,” and in certain circumstances may collect IP address, screen resolution and browser software and operating system types, clickstream patterns, dates and times that our site is accessed, and other categories of data.

If you want to block the use and saving of cookies from the Sites on to the computer’s hard drive, you should take the necessary steps within your web browser’s settings to block all cookies from the Sites and their external serving vendors.  Please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, certain parts of our Sites may not function correctly. For information on how to disable cookies, refer to your browser’s documentation.

**Interest-Based Advertising**

Interest-based advertising is advertising that is targeted to you based on your web browsing and app usage over time and across websites or apps. You have the option to restrict the use of information for interest-based advertising and to opt-out of receiving interest-based ads. Depending on from where you access our Sites, you may also be asked to consent to our use of cookies, including advertising cookies.

The opt-outs for interest-based advertising require that strictly necessary cookies are not blocked by the settings in your web browser. We support the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/) in the U.S., the [Canadian Digital Advertising Alliance](https://youradchoices.ca/) in Canada, and the [European Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.edaa.eu/European-principles/) in the EU. If you live in the United States, Canada, or the European Union, you can visit [Ad Choices](http://optout.aboutads.info/) (US), [Your Ad Choices](http://youradchoices.ca/choices/) (Canada), or [Your Online Choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) (EU) to find a convenient place to opt-out of interest-based advertising with participating entities for each region. These websites also provide detailed information about how interest-based advertising works. Opting out does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising from us, or when you use the Internet. It just means that the data collected from our website will not be used for interest-based advertising and that the advertising you see displayed on websites will not be customized to your interests.

**DO-NOT-TRACK**

Do-Not-Track is a public-private initiative that has developed a “flag” or signal that an Internet user may activate in the user’s browser software to notify websites that the user does not wish to be “tracked” by third-parties as defined by the initiative. The online community has not agreed on what actions, if any, should be taken by the websites that receive the “do not track” signal, and therefore Do-Not-Track is not yet standardized. Please note that the Sites do not alter their behavior or use practices when we receive a Do Not Track signal from your browser.

**Social Network Widgets**

Our Sites may include social network sharing widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or third parties about your interactions with our web pages that you visit, even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-in or widget. Information may be transmitted from your browser and may include an identifier assigned by the social network or third party, information about your browser type, operating system, device type, IP address, and the URL of the web page where widget appears. If you use social network tools or visit social networking sites, we encourage you to read their privacy disclosures, to learn what information they collect, use, and share.

**De-Identified or Anonymized Data**

We may create de-identified or anonymous data from Personal Information by removing data components (such as your name, email address, or linkable tracking ID) that makes the data personally identifiable to you or through obfuscation or through other means.  Our use of de-identified and anonymized data is not subject to this Privacy Policy.

**Information from Children Under 13 Years of Age**

We do not knowingly collect Personal Information online from individuals under 13 years without parental consent.  If you become aware that an individual under 13 years of age has provided us with Personal Information without parental consent, please contact us at _privacypolicy@wsvn.com_ or the address listed in the “Contact Us” section of this Privacy Policy.  If we become aware that an individual under 13 years has provided us with Personal Information without parental consent, we will take steps to remove the data as permitted by law.

**Links to Other Sites**

Our Sites may contain links or otherwise provide access to another website, mobile application, or Internet location (collectively “Third-Party Sites”). We provide these links merely for your convenience. We have no control over, do not review, and are not responsible for Third-Party Sites, their content, or any goods or services available through the Third-Party Sites. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to Third-Party Sites.  We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any Third-Party Sites with which you choose to interact.

**Opting-Out of Certain Communications**

If you want to stop receiving future marketing messages and materials, you can do so by clicking the “unsubscribe” link included in our email marketing messages or by contacting us at _privacypolicy@wsvn.com_ or the contact information listed in the “Contact Us” section of this Privacy Policy. Once you have submitted your email address to “unsubscribe,” please note that you may continue to receive emails for a period of time while our system updates your request.  Please note that you may continue to receive communications from us for non-marketing purposes, such as communications regarding the Services.

**Processing in the United States**

Please note that if you are visiting the Sites from outside of the United States, your information may be transferred to, stored, and/or processed in the United States.  The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country.  If you are located outside of the United States, the transfer of Personal Information is necessary to provide you with the requested information, products, and services and/or to perform any requested transaction.  By using any portion of the Sites, you acknowledge and consent to the transfer of your information to our facilities in the United States.

**Security**

We implement technical and organizational security safeguards designed to protect your Personal Information. However, please be advised that we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with the storage and transmission of Personal Information.

**Accessing or Updating Your Information**

Subject to applicable law, you may also make a request to access, update, correct, modify, or delete your Personal Information that we maintain by contacting us at  _privacypolicy@wsvn.com_ or the contact information listed in the “Contact Us” section of this Privacy Policy.

**California Privacy Rights**

Under Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California have the right to request from a business, with whom the California resident has an established business relationship, certain information with respect to the types of personal information (as defined by California law) the business shares with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and the identities of the third parties with whom the business has shared such information during the immediately preceding calendar year. To exercise your rights, you may make one request each year by emailing us at _privacypolicy@wsvn.com_ with “Request for California Privacy Information” in the subject line and in the body of your message. Be sure to provide in the request sufficient information to properly identify you and/or the members of your family.
