The records retention schedules published by the [State Archives ](http://www.sos.wa.gov/archives/)require us to keep this information only so long as it is useful, and then destroy it; these schedules change from time to time.

#### Section C. Personal Information

Personally identifiable information (“PII”) as defined in this Privacy Policy, means information about a natural person that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information includes such things as your name, address, and phone number.

We will not collect PII about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us by sending us email, or completing an online form or survey. You may choose not to contact us by e-mail or to provide any PII using an online form or survey. Your choice to not participate in these activities will not restrict impair your ability to use our site and read or download any information provided on the site.

We are especially concerned about protecting children's privacy. Under COPPA, a web site must get parental permission before collecting personally identifiable information about a child under the age of 13.

If you have questions about how we use your personally identifiable information, you can contact our agency as shown in the Contact Information section of this statement.

#### Section D. Public Access to Information

In the State of Washington, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by state government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records that serve various needs including the privacy of individuals. Exceptions are provided by both state and federal laws.

As a public agency, all our information is governed by laws such as Washington’s Public Records Act [RCW 42.56 ](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56). Information you send us may become a public record, and it may be subject to public inspection and copying if not otherwise protected by federal or state law. 

  Information collected through use of this site may be public information and subject to inspection and copying by members of the public. For example, the Public Records Act states that: 

> Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available for public inspection and copying all public records, unless the record falls within the specific exemptions of subsection (6) of this section [ [RCW 42.56.070(6) ](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56.070)], [Chapter 42.56 RCW ](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56), or other statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records. To the extent required to prevent an unreasonable invasion of personal privacy interests protected by [Chapter 42.56 RCW ](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56), an agency shall delete identifying details in a manner consistent with [Chapter 42.56 RCW ](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56)when it makes available or publishes any public record; however, in each case, the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in writing.

In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Public Records Act or other law governing the agency’s disclosure of records, the Public Records Act or other applicable law will control.

#### Section E. Correcting Personally Identifiable Information

State law requires agencies that collect personally identifiable information to provide “procedures for correcting inaccurate information, including establishing mechanisms for individuals to review information about them and recommend changes in information they believe to be inaccurate.” ( [RCW 43.105.365 ](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.105.365))

You can access any personally identifiable information we collect about you by using the information in the Contact Information section at the end of this Policy. We will do our best to correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information if you send us a written request that clearly shows the error. We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
