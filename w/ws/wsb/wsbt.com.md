However, if you want to use certain online services, you may be asked to provide some personal information, such as your name, mailing address or e-mail address. We also may ask you to choose a user name and password and provide that information when accessing certain online features. If you do not want to give us any personal information, you can always decide not to use the services. The choice is yours. We are only interested in offering you convenient online services that match your interests and needs.

Some examples of when we may request personal information include the following:

Second, we use the information to understand your use of our websites and to notify you about updates to one of our sites or to send you marketing materials or promotional offers that may be of interest. Third, we may use this information in aggregate form to help us evaluate and modify existing services and to help us develop additional services that are likely to be of interest to our users.

We may share your personal information with unaffiliated third parties in limited instances. For example, we may share your personal information with unaffiliated third parties as is necessary to process or collect payments, or service registered-user accounts. We also may hire third-party technology providers to host the WSBT Television, Inc., websites and to store your personal information.

We may also share aggregate, non-personal information about website usage with unaffiliated third parties, including, but not limited to, government agencies, advertisers and the media (i.e., __% of WSBT Television, Inc., website users are female, __% of users have visited certain sections, etc.). This aggregate information does not contain any personal information about our users.

Finally, we may be required to disclose personal information by law or legal process, to protect and defend the rights or property of a WSBT Television, Inc., site, or to protect the personal safety of users to one of our sites.

Only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they only may do so for permitted business functions.

**Accessing or Deleting Your Personal Information**

If you have submitted personal information through a WSBT Television, Inc., website and you would like to access that information, please send an e-mail to [johnson@wsbt.com](mailto:johnson@wsbt.com). We will use reasonable efforts to supply you with this information and to correct any factual inaccuracies that you identify. Upon your request, we also will remove your personal information from our databases.

**Collection, Use and Disclosure of Non-Personal Information**

In some cases, a WSBT Television, Inc., site may collect information about you that is not personally identifiable, as described below. Internet Protocol Addresses An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. This number does not identify your name, e-mail address or other personal information. If you request pages from any WSBT Television, Inc., website, that site's server will enter your IP address into a log.

To maintain user anonymity, WSBT Television, Inc., does not associate IP addresses with records containing personal information. We also do not permit IP addresses to be associated and viewed with posts to chat rooms and bulletin boards. We store IP addresses for a period of time to help us to identify anyone who refuses to comply with our in-house rules or terms of service, and to identify visitors who threaten our service, site, customers or others. We also will use this information to measure site traffic for purposes of system administration and for our sponsors. This aggregate data also helps us to understand how people are using the website and helps us improve your online experience.

**Cookies**

WSBT Television, Inc., sites also automatically gather certain non-personal information through the use of "cookies". "Cookies" are small text files that recognize repeat visitors, facilitate ongoing access to some sites, and allow sites to understand how and when pages are visited and by how many people. We use cookies primarily to make improvements and updates based on which areas are popular and which are not. We also use cookies to ensure the accuracy of our polling data. Except for personal information voluntarily provided by you (i.e., during any registration process), we do not use information transferred through cookies for promotional or marketing purposes, and that information is not shared with third parties.

Our advertisers may occasionally place cookies on your computer, which is standard in the Internet industry. Please note that WSBT Television, Inc., does not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to this Privacy Policy.

**Safeguarding Children’s Privacy**

WSBT Television, Inc., sites will not knowingly collect personal information or any other identifying data from children under 13 years of age without first obtaining verifiable consent from a parent or legal guardian. Requests for parental consent will explain how we collect, use, and disclose children's personal information, and will include an opportunity for parents to prevent use of their children's information, as well as to prevent their children from participating in features which involve the collection of personal information. Should a child whom we know to be under 13 send personal information to a WSBT Television, Inc., site without first obtaining parental consent, the site will immediately delete that information from its database.

We will not use, distribute or disclose any child's personal information to third parties without prior parental consent. If, at any time, a parent withdraws his or her consent to our use or maintenance of personal information collected from his or her child, we will promptly remove such information from our database. In addition, we will not require children under 13 years of age to disclose more personal information than is necessary in order to participate in any online feature or service.

**External Links**

When you click on one of these links, you will be transferred from a WSBT Television, Inc., website and connected to the website of the organization or company that you selected. Even if an affiliation exists between WSBT Television, Inc., and a third-party website, WSBT Television, Inc., exercises no control over linked sites. Each of these linked sites maintains its own independent privacy and data collection policies and procedures.
