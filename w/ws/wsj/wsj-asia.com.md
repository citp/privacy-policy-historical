**Surveys:** We may conduct occasional surveys. These surveys are entirely voluntary and you may easily decline to participate.

 _ **How We Use Information Collected**_

We also may disclose personally identifiable information when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so.

**Third-Party and Corporate Subscriptions.** If your subscription to the Journal Asia is provided by a third party, such as a subscription agent or your employer, we may provide to that third party limited amounts of your personally identifiable information as appropriate.
