<hr><b>GENERAL</b><p>

Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc., publisher of The Wall Street
Journal Online and Barron's Online, and its affiliates (hereafter referred to
collectively as "Dow Jones") are committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information that you provide to us when using The Wall Street Journal Online and Barron's Online (hereafter referred to collectively as the "Services"). This Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information received about you when you visit or subscribe to the Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any personal information received by Dow Jones in connection with your subscriptions to the print editions of The Wall Street Journal or Barron's.
</p><p>
We may make content or services from other Web sites including our affiliated or co-branded Web sites available to you from links located on the Services. These other Web sites are not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you review the privacy policy at each such Web site to determine how that site protects your privacy.
</p><hr><p>
<b>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b></p><p>
<b>General</b>: When you register, and at other times, we will collect personally identifiable information from you that may include your name, age, address, e-mail address, credit-card number and facts about your computers, profession, investing habits and similar information. We do not, however, knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen.

</p><p>

<b>Surveys</b>: We may conduct occasional online surveys. For example, when you're within the Services, you may see a pop-up window offering you the optional opportunity of participating in a survey. These surveys are entirely voluntary and you may easily decline to participate.
</p><p>

<b>Web Site Usage Information</b>: We automatically collect IP addresses and Web site usage information from you when you visit the Services. This information helps us evaluate how our visitors and subscribers use and navigate our Web sites, including the number and frequency of visitors and subscribers to each Web page, and the length of their visits.
</p><hr><p>
<b>HOW WE USE INFORMATION COLLECTED</b>
</p><div>
We may use information in the following ways:

<ul>
<li>For the purposes for which you specifically provided the information including, for example, to enable us to process, validate and verify subscriptions.</li>
<li>To send you e-mail notifications about our new or existing products and services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you.</li>

<li>To enhance existing features or develop new features, products and services.</li>
<li>To provide advertisers and other third parties with aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns.</li>
<li>To allow us to personalize the content and advertising that you and others see based on personal characteristics or preferences.</li>
</ul>
We may combine the information that we collect from you on the Services with information that you provide to us in connection with your use of our other products, services and Web sites. </div>
<p>
We may hire other companies to perform services on our behalf including, without limitation, facilitating some aspects of the Services, sending e-mail, and fulfilling purchase requests. These other companies may be supplied with or have access to your personally identifiable information solely for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf.
</p><p>
We use third parties, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to deliver ads to you on our behalf. These third-party ad servers may be supplied with or have access to your personally identifiable information solely for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf. They also may also collect and use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to the Services and other Web sites in order to present advertisements that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice or to opt out of having this information used by third-party ad servers to provide targeted ads, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="new">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>.
</p><p>
Except as specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personally identifiable information outside of Dow Jones unless you "opt in" to having your personally identifiable information shared with a company that is not affiliated with us.

</p><p>
We may disclose and use personally identifiable information in special circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use (for example, when necessary to protect our intellectual property rights). We may also disclose or use your personal information when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so.
</p><hr><p>

<b>THIRD PARTY AND CORPORATE SUBSCRIPTIONS</b>
</p><p>
If your access to the Services is provided by your employer or a third party, we may notify your employer or that third party when you access the Services.  In doing so, we may reveal limited amounts of your personally identifiable information such as your name or email address.  In some cases, your employer or the third party providing your access may provide us with limited amounts of personal information about you to facilitate your access to the Services and so that we may identify you when providing it with user and usage information.
</p><hr><p>

<b>DISCUSSIONS</b></p><p>
The <a href="/discussions">
Discussions</a> section of The Wall Street Journal Online provides
you with an opportunity to tell us what you think and read what other readers
have to say. When you use our Discussions features (for example, by posting a
message on our Discussions message boards, responding to our Question of the
Day or by participating in our E-mail Express Yourself forum), we may make
public any information that you provide including your name, location and
e-mail address.
</p><hr><p>

The information that is collected through the use of these images is not personally identifiable and is used only to track response to our advertising efforts.
</p><hr><p>
<b>SECURITY</b></p><p>
The personally identifiable information we collect about you is stored in limited-access servers. We will maintain safeguards to protect the security of these servers and your personally identifiable information.
</p><hr><p>
