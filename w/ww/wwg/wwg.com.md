## Privacy Policy

Intellisync believes strongly that every person has the right to privacy. When using our website, services and/or products, you may give us information. Intellisync asks for and maintains information on its visitors and customers to provide a better, more personal experience.   
Privacy is very important to Intellisync. This privacy statement describes the conduct and practices of Intellisync as it applies to our clients and visitors.  


Information Collection

Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address, other contact information, title, birth date, gender, occupation, industry, personal interests, other information when needed to provide a service you requested.  
When you browse our website, you do so anonymously, unless you have previously indicated that you wish Intellisync to remember your login and password. We don't automatically collect personal information, including your email address. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our website you visit and how long you spend there. But we do not link your IP address to any personal information unless you have logged in to our website. Like many other commercial websites, the Intellisync website may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the site. Please go to "Cookies and Tracking Technology" below for more information.  
Intellisync collects personal information when you register with Intellisync for an Intellisync account, when you use certain Intellisync products or services, when you register to attend a seminar or participate in an online survey, when you ask to be included in an email or other mailing list, or you submit an entry for a sweepstakes or other promotions, or when you submit your personal information to Intellisync for any other reason. From time to time, Intellisync receives personal information from business partners and vendors. Intellisync only uses such information if it has been collected in accordance with acceptable privacy practices consistent with this Policy and applicable laws.  
Access to certain Intellisync web pages require a login and a password. The use of those web pages, and the information or programs downloadable from those sites, may be governed by a written agreement between your employer and Intellisync. Unless you request deletion of your personal information as specified below, your personal information may be retained by Intellisync to verify compliance with the agreement, log software licenses granted, to track software downloaded from those pages, or track usage of other applications available on those pages.

Notice

When personal information is collected, we will inform you at the point of collection the purpose for the collection. Intellisync will not transfer your personal information to third parties without your consent, except under the limited conditions described under the discussion entitled "Information Sharing and Disclosure" below.  
If you choose to provide us with your personal information, we may only transfer that information, within Intellisync or to Intellisync's third party service providers with your permission. Upon receiving your permission, we may transfer your information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.  
We will always give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving direct marketing or market research information. This means we assume you have given us your consent to collect and use your information in accordance with this Policy unless you take affirmative action to indicate that you do not consent, for instance by clicking or checking the appropriate option or box at the point of collection. In some cases, when applicable, we will provide you with the opportunity to "opt in." This means we will require your affirmative action to indicate your consent before we use your information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted.

Cookies and Tracking Technology

Intellisync employs cookies in order for its server to recognize a return visitor as a unique user. Cookies are small text files placed in the 'Cookies' folder on a visitor's hard disk and allow for Intellisync to remember the visitor. The cookies placed by the Intellisync server are readable only by Intellisync, and cookies cannot access, read or modify any other data on a computer. All web-browsers offer the option to refuse any cookie, and if a visitor refuses the Intellisync cookie then Intellisync does not gather any information on that visitor.

Information Collected

The Intellisync system will gather information such as what kind of browser a visitor is on, what operating system they are using, their IP address, and their clickstream information (for example, which pages they have viewed and how long they have been there). Note that information is only gathered while the visitor is on the website in question -- in this case [www.Intellisync.com](http://www.intellisync.com/). Intellisync monitors how a visitor arrives at the website, but cannot and will not gather information about other sites the visitor has been on. 

At times, Intellisync may ask for more specific contact information to be entered as a means of registration before accessing a certain part of the site. Intellisync uses this information to understand its visitors and, with permission, to provide visitors with updates on the company and its products. A visitor may always option to not enter any information about themselves.  


Information Usage

Intellisync collects identifying information when you use certain Intellisync products or services, when you visit Intellisync.com web pages or microsite web pages, or when you enter promotions or contests.  
Intellisync also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, time stamp (time page accessed as well as time spent per web page), as well as the specific pages you requested.   
The only time Intellisync, its partners, subsidiaries, agents, officers or employees would provide specific information to anyone is if required to do so by law, and even then only to the proper authorities.

Information Sharing and Disclosure

Because Intellisync is a global company, your personal information may be shared with other Intellisync offices or subsidiaries around the world. All such entities are governed by this Privacy Policy or are bound by the appropriate confidentiality and data transfer agreements.  
Your personal information is never shared outside Intellisync without your permission, except under conditions explained below. Inside Intellisync, data is stored in controlled servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where Intellisync, its subsidiaries, affiliates or agents are located.  
Intellisync may send your personal information to other companies or people under any of the following circumstances: when we have your consent to share the information; we need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; we need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Intellisync to provide a product or service to you (we will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose); or we want to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers or other information we think you'd like to hear about either from us or from our business partners (unless you have opted out of these types of communications). We will also disclose your personal information if required to do so by law, to enforce our Terms of Use, or in urgent circumstances, to protect personal safety, the public or our websites.

Data Security

Your Intellisync account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. Intellisync safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. In certain areas of our websites, Intellisync uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to enhance the security of data transmissions. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit to us, and so we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.

Children and Privacy

Our websites do not target and are not intended to attract children under the age of 13. Intellisync does not knowingly solicit personal information from children under the age of 13 or send them requests for personal information.

Third Party Sites

Intellisync's website contains links to other sites. Intellisync does not share your personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.  
Our website may contain links to websites operated by other companies. Some of these third-party sites may be co-branded with a Intellisync logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by Intellisync. Although we choose our business partners carefully, Intellisync is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our site. Once you have left our website, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party website to determine how they will handle any information they collect from you.

Changes to this Privacy Policy

Intellisync will amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we will make that information available by posting a notice on this site.
