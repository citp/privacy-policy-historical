Personal information is any information that can be used to distinguish, identify or contact a specific individual. This information can include an individual's name, contact information, opinions, social status and family relationships.

Exceptions include business-related information and certain publicly available information such as business address, name, title and fax. Where an individual uses his or her home contact information as business contact information as well, we consider that the contact information provided is business contact information. 

**What Personal Information do we collect?**

We collect and maintain different types of personal information about individuals with whom we interact which is relevant for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate for a donor-charity relationship. 

This includes: 

· Contact and identification information, such as your name, address, telephone number, mobile number and e-mail address;   
· Donation information such as date of gift, amount of gift, appeal (the campaign you contributed to), name of spouse or partner if it was a joint gift; receipt number.   
· Financial information such as your payment methods and preferences, billing and banking information (credit card number and expiry date or chequing account transit numbers, whichever payment type you prefer in order to process your donation);   
· Product and service related information concerning the sale of apparel, books and gifts and other products or services that we provide to you;   
· Other personal information used for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in light of the circumstances. 

**Why Do We Collect Personal Information?**

WWF-Canada collects personal information to further its fundraising and public education and advocacy commitments, as well as to establish, maintain and manage our relationship with you. Certain information is collected to satisfy the requirements of Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA). 

**How do we Use Your Personal Information?**

We will not, without your consent, use your personal information for any purpose other than as described in this Privacy Policy, except where permitted or required by applicable law or regulatory requirements. We use your personal information for fundraising, to process donations, to respond to requests for information and to periodically keep you informed and up to date on WWF-Canada’s conservation activities and campaigns. If you subscribe to our electronic newsletter (Panda Mail) on our Web site (www.wwf.ca), in addition, we use your personal information to send you special offers and updates, service announcements relating to our Web site and to invite you to participate in surveys or contests. 

**Sharing of Personal Information**

Third party service providers may be engaged by WWF-Canada to perform a variety of functions, such as to mail our brochures, to process your donation, to fulfill your order or to provide technical services for our Web site, etc. These third party providers have access to personal information if needed to perform the functions for which they are retained. However, we direct that those companies may only use such personal information for the purpose of performing their roles and may not use it for any other purpose. In these cases, when information is shared, WWF-Canada will demand reasonable assurance that the third parties will protect your information in conformity with our privacy practices.
