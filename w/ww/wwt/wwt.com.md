# Privacy Policy - WWT

##  How We Share Your Personal Data 

You can make the following choices regarding your Personal Data: 

####  **Changes To Your Personal Information**

We rely on you to update and correct your personal information.  Note that we may keep historical information in our backup files as permitted by law.   All requests to correct your information must be directed to the contact in the “How You May Contact Us Regarding Your Personal Information” section below. 

####  ****Deletion Of Your Personal Data****

Typically, we retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Any biometric or similar information we collect, if any, will be deleted no later than the first anniversary of the date the purpose for collecting the identifier expires unless a different period is required by law.  Some users may have the right to request that we delete their personal information. All deletion requests must be directed to the contact in the “How You May Contact Us Regarding Your Personal Information” section below.   We may also decide to delete your data if we believe that the data is incomplete, inaccurate, or that our continued use and storage are contrary to our obligations to other individuals or third parties.  When we delete personal information, it will be removed from our active database, but it may remain in archives where it is not practical or possible to delete it. In addition, we may keep your personal information as needed to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and/or enforce any of our agreements. 

####  ****Revocation Of Consent or Objections****

You may revoke consent to processing (where our processing is based upon consent), or object to our processing (where our processing is not based upon your consent) by contacting us at the address described below.  If you revoke your consent / object, we may no longer be able to provide you services. In some cases we may limit or deny your request to revoke consent / object if the law permits or requires us to do so, or if we are unable to adequately verify your identity. 

####  ****Access To Your Personal Data****

If required by law, upon request, we will grant reasonable access to the personal information that we hold about a user. All requests must be directed to the contact in the “Contact Information” section. 

####  ****Online Tracking****

We do not currently recognize browser signals of tracking preferences, which may include "Do Not Track" instructions.
