**BY USING THIS WEBSITE, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR ASSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY TERM IN THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE OR SUBMIT ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THROUGH THIS WEBSITE.**

1\. OUR COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY

WWT.com (“World Wide Technology”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to all information submitted by you on or through this website and it explains the type of information we may collect and how we may use it. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to be aware of our privacy protection procedures and the use of your personal information provided to us. Please keep in mind that this Privacy Policy applies only to this World Wide Technology website for the United States and does not address information that we might obtain from places other than this website. Since other websites (including those to which we link) have their own privacy practices, we encourage you to ask questions and provide information only to those sites whose privacy practices you understand and trust. Also, we may revise our Privacy Policy from time to time, so please check this page periodically.

2\. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE 

2.1 What Information We Collect

We collect non-personally identifiable information about you in a number of ways, including tracking your activities through your IP address. Our servers typically log your IP address when you request a page from this website. You remain anonymous to us since we do not link your IP address to anything personally identifiable. However, we do collect personally identifiable information about you when you voluntarily submit it to us.

Our website has been designed to meet your needs. As is standard practice on many corporate websites, World Wide Technology’s website utilizes cookies to gather technical information. A cookie is a small data file installed on your computer hard drive by a web server. Generally speaking, it records data about your computer’s navigation within our website (pages viewed, date and time of your visit, etc.), which are read during subsequent visits. Cookies provide websites with information regarding the state your browser is in. Our website may also use the servers of our advertising partners to display the advertisements seen on our website pages. These partners may also utilize cookies to help target the advertisements shown towards your needs.

Please note that if your internet browser is configured to not accept cookies, we cannot guarantee that the services available to you on our website will work correctly.

2.2 How We Use This Information

Your personally identifiable information may be shared with and stored on a database controlled by third parties that have been hired by us to provide limited services on our behalf. Agents or contractors of World Wide Techology who have access to your personally identifiable information are required to use their best efforts to keep the information confidential and are prohibited from using this information for any purpose not previously disclosed to you.

We use personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information for site administration and for the purpose of performing the services for which such data was collected.

We do not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties, unless disclosure is required by law or to protect our interests. At times, World Wide Technology may be required by law or litigation to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary.

Even though our information practices may change from time to time, we will not use your information in a manner not previously disclosed to you in our Privacy Policy. We will provide you with notice by posting any privacy policy changes on this website, and you will have an opportunity to reject such changes.

3\. UPDATING OR CORRECTING YOUR INFORMATION

If you provide us with personally identifiable information in order for us to correspond with you or in order for us perform services for you, we will use reasonable diligence to provide you with a way to review the information we have on file and either update or correct this information.

4\. SECURITY PRECAUTIONS

Your privacy is very important to us. We use security technology and security procedures that are reasonably designed to help maintain the privacy of your personal information. Among other techniques, we usually store such information on a computer behind our “firewall” in a secure location, and we often restrict the number of employees internally who can access this data. Of course, there is no such thing as “perfect security” on the Internet and we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online. Further, please note that our servers are run by a third party web host whose actions we do not control.

5\. TERMS OF USE

Please consult our [Terms of Use](http://www2.wwt.com/?p=1314) for the conditions under which World Wide Technology makes its website available to users and the conditions under which users may have access to and use this website.

6\. AMENDMENTS

This Privacy Policy became effective on January 1, 2008. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we change this Privacy Policy in a material way, a notice will be posted on our website along with the updated Privacy Policy. Any amendments will be effective when posted.

As this privacy policy is designed to become more comprehensive over time, we want it to develop in line with your requirements and expectations. We are therefore open to all questions and suggestions related to our privacy policy.
