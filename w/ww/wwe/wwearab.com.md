    * Some of these activities have additional rules containing information about how we use and disclose your Personal Information.



We use this information to manage our contractual relationship with you.

**How you can access, change or suppress your Personal Information  **

You may correct, delete, or update some of the Personal Information associated with a particular account by, [clicking here](https://www.wwe.com/my-profile) and signing into the relevant account.  Other Personal Information may be corrected or updated by contacting us via: [privacy@wwe.com](mailto:privacy@wwe.com).

In your request, please make clear what Personal Information you would like to have changed, whether you would like to have your Personal Information suppressed from our database or otherwise let us know what limitations you would like to put on our use of your Personal Information.  For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request.  We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. 

Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the Personal Information provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion).    There may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed.

If you are a resident of California, under 18 and a registered user of the Services, you may ask us to remove content or information that you have posted to the Services by writing to [privacy@wwe.com](mailto:privacy@wwe.com).  Please note that your request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information, as, for example, some of your content may have been reposted by another user. 

###  **Retention Period**

We will retain your Personal Information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law.  The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:  (i) the length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to you; (ii) whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject; or (iii) whether retention is legally advisable (for example, in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).
