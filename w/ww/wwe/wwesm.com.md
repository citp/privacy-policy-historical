WWE wants to help you make the most of your visit to our websites and mobile application, and that includes helping to protect your personal privacy. Most of the features on our websites and mobile application are offered without collecting any Personal Information from you; however, some features require you to provide your Personal Information. For example, when you make a purchase or sign up for a paid service (such as in the WWE Shop), you are required to submit Personal Information in connection with our providing various products and services to you. You may also submit content of your own in areas of our websites and mobile application, and some of that User-Generated Content may contain Personal Information. For those areas of our websites and services that do require us to collect Personal Information or allow voluntary submission of Personal Information, this Privacy Policy will offer suggestions on how to make good decisions for yourself and your family.

This Privacy Policy discloses when and how we collect, use, share, and safeguard information from these websites. The Personal Information we collect depends on what you do when you visit our websites or use the various products or services we offer. This Privacy Policy also explains what to do if you do not want to provide Personal Information when you visit our websites, and how to correct, change or delete information you have already provided to us.

By using these websites, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any terms or practices described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use our websites.

As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means any information by which a particular natural person is reasonably identifiable. Personal Information includes, for example a first name or initial and last name; a home or other physical address; a date of birth; an e-mail address or other online contact information; or a telephone number. When Personal Information is collected, you will know because you will be providing it to us; for example, you may fill out a form on the website or submit information via your account or profile, or in connection with requesting various products or services. When you make a purchase or sign up for a paid service, we will also collect additional Personal Information such as your credit or debit card information or information concerning any other payment mechanism we accept (“Payment Information”). We will use Payment Information only as described in this Privacy Policy to process and complete the transactions you have requested.

 **Children**

WWE is committed to providing special protection for the privacy of children who may visit our websites. We encourage parents to spend time online with their children, become familiar with the features of our websites and participate in the activities offered on our websites. For more information on getting involved in your children's online activities, please go to our [WWE Parents site](http://corporate.wwe.com/parents/overview.jsp "WWE Parents"). Our protections for the privacy of children include the following:

We do not knowingly solicit, collect, use or retain any Personal Information, for any purpose whatsoever (including internal or external marketing or promotional purposes), from visitors to these websites who are under the age of 13. In addition, we will delete any records of such Personal Information that come to our attention.

We do not allow visitors who we know are under the age of 13 to be listed in any directory of registered users, to participate in any of our chat services, to register for contests, sweepstakes, promotions, or newsletters, or to receive direct marketing from WWE or from our third-party affiliates or service or product providers.

We do collect Personal Information as part of registration processes so that users can obtain certain services, such as newsletters, and so that they can set up accounts or profiles. No person may open such accounts or profiles if he or she is under the age of 13. We do not knowingly allow such persons to register and our websites may employ features and procedures that are intended to help prevent under-age registrations. If we believe that a person who is under the age of 13 has registered with us or set up a profile, account, or has otherwise violated our age-related requirements for a profile, we will terminate that registration and will undertake commercially reasonable efforts to delete any Personal Information we have obtained, including all content from any profile or account.

We recommend that minors who are age 13 or older consult with their parents before sending any information about themselves over the internet.

 **Special Note to Parents**

If you become aware that your child has provided us with Personal Information at one of our websites, we invite you to notify us so that we may delete the information from our records and discontinue any related features or services (see "Opt-Out" below). We appreciate your cooperation in assisting us to provide a safe and enjoyable online experience for your children.

 **Social Media Features**

Our websites and mobile application include Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

 **Facebook Connect or other OpenID provider**

You can log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an OpenID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personal Information with us such as your name and e-mail address to pre-populate our sign-up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on our websites to your profile page to share with others within your network.   

 **Collection of Personal Information**

WWE collects Personal Information from visitors to our websites in a number of ways. These include the following:

  * Subscriptions to our free newsletters, which include updates, special offers and promotions from WWE's various entities, subsidiaries, and affiliates.
  * Participation in contests and sweepstakes.
  * Registrations to receive free downloadable desktop applications (e.g., screensavers).
  * Registrations to participate in chat services (such as WWE.com chat and Pay Per View chats), message boards and the gaming area.
  * Registrations to send electronic greeting cards.
  * Registrations for individual accounts or profiles.
  * Purchases of merchandise, Streaming Pay Per View events, and transactions where home delivery is required.
  * E-mail transmitted via various links on our websites.



The use of any of these services is entirely optional and voluntary; however, if you do not provide the Personal Information requested, we may elect to not make the related services available for your use. If you send us an e-mail in which you disclose Personal Information, we will use it to discuss the subject of your correspondence and, if appropriate, share it with other interested parties (such as manufacturers of merchandise you have purchased from a website).

If you send us an e-mail, you should know that e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. So, if your communication needs to include sensitive information like your Payment Information or social security number, please contact us by postal mail or telephone (see "Contact Us" below) rather than e-mail.

We collect your location-based information for the purpose of detecting your location so that we may serve you the correct version of the application. We will only share this information with our mapping provider for the sole purpose of providing you the service. If you no longer wish to allow us to track your location-based information in the Mobile App you may turn this off at the device level.

We may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests on our websites. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as city, state, zip code). We also use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes.

We may also request a video submission containing your physical likeness, height, weight and other personally identifiable information you voluntarily disclose in the video. We may display user-created video submissions, the user's name, self-identified "nickname" and location (city, state and country) on our websites. Such submissions may be posted to the website and will be visible to other users and visitors of the websites.

 **Tracking Technologies**

Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by WWE, our affiliates and advertising partners and our partners who server content on our site. These technologies are used in allowing us to recognize your computer to save you from having to re-enter the same data every time you visit our websites, allowing us to learn how visitors use our websites, analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.

 **Log Files**

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.

 **Push Notifications**

We send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information.

All Personal Information that WWE collects at our websites is transferred to, and accessed from, jurisdictions including the United States. By using our websites and/or by submitting Personal Information to these websites, you consent to having your information transferred to, and accessed from, any location worldwide, including the United States. You also consent to having your Personal Information processed and maintained in any location worldwide, including the United States. You acknowledge that other jurisdictions may have laws that are different than the law of your home country.

 **How We Use Your Information**

We limit the manner in which your Personal and Payment Information is used. We will use the Personal and Payment Information you provide only in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If we obtain Personal or Payment Information from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is also governed by this Privacy Policy. We use Personal and Payment Information for purposes such as: providing you the products and services you want; administering or enforcing transactions you have requested; protecting your accounts from fraud, unauthorized access, or identity theft; verifying your identity in connection with transactions you have requested; and managing our business and protecting our interests. We also use Personal Information (but not Payment Information) to better understand and serve the needs of the WWE community, and to provide news and information to community members on new content, products services, and features of WWE and/or our websites including, without limitation, via direct e-mail. If you have registered with us and do not want to be contacted in the future by WWE or our advertising partners, please see "Opt-Out" below.

We may share Personal and Payment Information with our service providers to assist us with any of the purposes set forth above (which, for example, might include disclosures to attorneys, accountants, auditors, credit bureaus, data processors, payment processors, and technical systems consultants) to the extent necessary or appropriate for them to perform their services to us. In that connection, we may report information about your account(s) to credit bureaus and/or consumer reporting agencies. By way of example, if you order a product or service from us or register for one of our contests, promotions, or interactive services, WWE may share Personal Information with other service providers, suppliers and other third parties (for example, sweepstakes sponsors or delivery services) that assist us in operating the websites or providing the products or services. We do not share your Personal Information to third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy.

Please note that we will release your Personal or Payment Information if required to do so by law, search warrant, subpoena, court order or other legal process. WWE may also disclose your Personal or Payment Information if we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to detect or prevent fraud or to protect the rights, property, health or personal safety of WWE, WWE employees, our third party licensors, customers or the public. We may also disclose your Personal or Payment Information if you or your legal representative authorizes us to do so, or if it is necessary to perform credit checks or collect or report debts owed to us. 

WWE reserves the right to transfer any Personal or Payment Information in the event we transfer all or a portion of our business or assets, such as bankruptcy, dissolution, merger or acquisition. If such a transfer should occur, the privacy policy of another company may supplant our Policy. However, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee uses Personal or Payment Information in a manner that is consistent with our Policy.
