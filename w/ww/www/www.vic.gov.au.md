##  Collection of Personal Information

It is intended that www.vic.gov.au can be used anonymously.

However, for some functions of www.vic.gov.au the collection of personal information is necessary or unavoidable.

You will know if www.vic.gov.au is collecting personal information from you because you will be requested to provide it. There are two exceptions to this.

The first exception is where someone else provides www.vic.gov.au with your personal information. www.vic.gov.au cannot prevent this. However, you are entitled to access and correct any personal information about you collected by www.vic.gov.au.

The second exception is where www.vic.gov.au collects statistics using software techniques such as web server log file analysis, clickstream data, cookies and web beacons. For an explanation of these techniques, and how they are used on www.vic.gov.au, see Web measurement services used by www.vic.gov.au below. Such statistics may qualify as personal information under the _Information Privacy Act 2000 (Vic)_. However, these statistics are not used to identify individual users of www.vic.gov.au.

##  Internet Use Risk

You should be aware that there are risks in transmitting information across the Internet. However, www.vic.gov.au takes reasonable steps to protect any personal information from unauthorised access once that personal information comes into its possession.

On the Victorian Government directory website there is a link to a feedback form for the general public to alert www.vic.gov.au to errors or omissions in data for resolution or referral. The Victorian Government Contact Centre phone number is displayed to allow for verbal feedback.

##  Social Media Websites and Applications

Our intention is to provide a seamless visitor experience to enhance our website visitor's ability to access information and communicate with the Victorian Government.

Some social media websites and applications may make personally identifiable information available to the public. www.vic.gov.au will not collect, maintain, use, or share any personally identifiable information that becomes available through the use of social media websites or applications.
