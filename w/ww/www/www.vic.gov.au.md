## Collection of personal information

It is intended that Victoria Online can be used anonymously. 

However, for some functions of Victoria Online the collection of personal information is necessary or unavoidable. 

You will know if Victoria Online is collecting personal information from you because you will be requested to provide it. There are two exceptions to this. 

The first exception is where someone else provides Victoria Online with your personal information. Victoria Online cannot prevent this. However, you are entitled to access and correct any personal information about you collected by Victoria Online. 

The second exception is where Victoria Online collects statistics using software techniques such as web server log file analysis, clickstream data, cookies and web beacons. For an explanation of these techniques, and how they are used on Victoria Online, see Web measurement services used by Victoria Online below. Such statistics may qualify as personal information under the Information Privacy Act 2000 (Vic.). However, these statistics are not used to identify individual users of Victoria Online.

## Internet Use Risks

You should be aware that there are risks in transmitting information across the Internet. However, Victoria Online takes reasonable steps to protect any personal information from unauthorised access once that personal information comes into its possession.

  * does not endorse or authorise the content of any third party website;
  * is not affiliated or associated with the owner or operator of any third party website; and

## Website personalisation features of Victoria Online

### Use of Cookies

A cookie is a block of data that is shared between a web server and a user’s browser. 

Victoria Online uses first party cookies to enable users to personalise their use of the website’s weather information. A first party cookie is that which is created by the website you are currently visiting – in this case Victoria Online. If you do not allow cookies to be used within your browser, then you will not be able to take advantage of the weather personalisation features offered by this website. ****

In using these cookies Victoria Online does not retrieve or record any personal information. For example, we do not use cookies to collect names or email addresses. 

### Web Server Log Files

Victoria Online uses standard web analytics software packages to analyse its web server log files to track web site usage. This analysis provides general data including number of visits, unique visits, pages viewed, browser type, how the site is navigated, search terms used, the sections of the website visited and other website usage information without identifying individual users.

## Web measurement service used by Victoria Online

Victoria Online currently uses [Nielsen//NetRatings](https://web.archive.org/CountHits?uri=pri03&redirectTo=http://www.netratings.com/) as its web monitoring service provider. 

### Use of Cookies

As part of the service provided by our web monitoring service provider, Victoria Online uses third party cookies to assist us to make your experience of our website easier and more efficient. Third-party cookies are created by a website other than the one you are currently visiting. The third party cookies used by Victoria Online are provided by Nielsen//NetRatings. These cookies collect information such as the number of visits, unique visits, documents viewed, browser type, how the site is navigated, the type of search engine used, the sections of the website visited and other website usage information. 

### Use of Web Beacons

The Nielsen//NetRatings service also uses [web beacons](https://web.archive.org/CountHits?uri=pri04&redirectTo=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Web_beacon.html). These web beacons capture every visit, and measure interactivity at the browser-level. This technology helps measure what is actually viewed on the site. While the anonymous statistical data Victoria Online collects may be aggregated and used in broader statistical analysis by either Victoria Online or its web monitoring service provider to improve our services, at no time can Victoria Online personally identify you as the source of that data. 

### Use of Clickstream data

"[Clickstream](https://web.archive.org/CountHits?uri=pri05&redirectTo=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/c/clickstream.html)" data is gathered by the Nielsen//NetRatings service and by Victoria Online when monitoring computer browsers in relation to the path website visitors take while moving within Victoria Online. In this instance, individuals are not identified only unique browsers.

Further information about how our web monitoring service provider collects and uses information gathered over the web is available from the [ Nielsen//NetRatings website](https://web.archive.org/CountHits?uri=pri06&redirectTo=http://www.nielsen-netratings.com/privacy/sitecensus.htm). 

Victoria Online uses the clickstream data provided by Nielsen//NetRatings or which it collects itself purely for statistical purposes (such as the most popular searches and the times of the day that Victoria Online is used most/least) without identifying individual users.
