Privacy Statement

This statement sets out SA Central's policies relating to the privacy of your personal information.

SA Central is operated in compliance with the South Australian Government's Information Privacy Principles, a copy of which can be obtained at:  
<http://www.premcab.sa.gov.au/pdf/circulars/Privacy.pdf>.

The SA Central web site collects the following information from users: 

  1. A record of your visit and logs the following information for statistical purposes - the user's IP address, the date and time of the visit to the site, the pages accessed and documents downloaded, the previous site visited and the type of browser used. No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect our service provider's logs. This information is analysed at the end of each month to determine the site's usage statistics.
  2. SA Central retains the e-mail address of people who send E-mails through the "Contact Us" facility, for the purpose of sending a response. They are stored in a secure area within the Government's Message Services System and will not be used for any other purpose nor disclosed without your consent.
  3. People who submit web sites for registration on SA Central, are asked to supply the following information: 
    * Name
    * Agency
    * Phone number
    * e-mail address  


This information is used to establish ownership of the material and enables the SA Central team to contact website administrators/content owners, to confirm (or not) the site registration and advise them of the location and category within SA Central where their website link has been placed. The information is then kept for contact purposes in the course of monitoring site currency. The information is stored in a secure area of the SA Central system.

No personal details are provided to any other individual or organisation, and access to this information is restricted to members of the SA Central team.

Please note that SA Central contains links to a large number of other web sites that are included on the basis of containing content related to South Australian business, community or government. When a user has clicked on a link to another site, they leave the SA Central site and are no longer protected by the SA Central Privacy conditions.

This privacy statement is periodically reviewed in line with the ongoing development of the SA Central Website.
