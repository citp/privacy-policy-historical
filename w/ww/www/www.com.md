### Protection of Personal Information

[WWW.com](http://www.com/) endeavours to maintain adequate physical, procedural and technical security with respect to its offices and information storage facilities so as to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of Personal Information. This also applies to our disposal or destruction of Personal Information.  
As part of those precautions, we restrict access to Personal Information to those employees and external service providers we determine need to know that information in order that [WWW.com](http://www.com/) may provide its sevices. [WWW.com](http://www.com/) has a policy under which employee misuse of Personal Information is treated as a serious offence for which disciplinary action may be taken.  
Where required, www.com may also engage other service providers located in the United States. Therefore, some of your personal information may be retained in the United States where privacy laws may offer different levels of protection from those in Canada and your personal information may be subject to access by and disclosure to law enforcement agencies under American legislation such as the USA Patriot Act.   
We audit our procedures and security measures from time to time to ensure that they remain effective and appropriate.
