        is automatically collected from visitors to our sites.
        Personally identifiable information about visitors to our
        sites is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily
        submitted. We may collect certain non-personal
        information to optimize our Web pages for your computer
        (i.e., the identity of your Internet browser, the type of
        operating system you use, your IP address and the domain

        will notify you when we are collecting personally
        identifiable information about you and how we intend to
        use it. For example, we may need to collect such
        information to provide you with information
        you requested, in connection with entry forms, or in connection with community
        postings such as chat and bulletin boards. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF8000">Sometimes
        wwiTV.com engages in activities with business partners

        collected or shared. We will try to make it clear at the
        time of collection who is asking for and/or sharing your
        information. In situations where your information will be
        shared, it is recommended that you also review the
        privacy policy of our business partner or sponsor.</font></p>

        Policy or at the time of collection. Such other uses may
        include sending you information or materials we think you
        will find interesting, or sharing the information with
        wwiTV.com's Media's advertisers and reputable business
        partners. However, at the time of collection, you will
        have the option of instructing us not to send you
