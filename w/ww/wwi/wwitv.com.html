            voluntarily submitted. We may collect certain non-personal
            information to optimize our Web pages for your computer (i.e., the
            identity of your Internet browser, the type of operating system you
            use, your IP address and the domain name of your Internet service
            provider). We may use such non-personal information for internal

            information about you and how we intend to use it. For example, we
            may need to collect such information to provide you with information
            you requested, in connection with entry forms, or in connection with
            community postings such as chat and bulletin boards. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sometimes
            wwiTV engages in activities with business partners and sponsors
            with whom personal information is jointly collected or shared. We
            will try to make it clear at the time of collection who is asking
            for and/or sharing your information. In situations where your
            information will be shared, it is recommended that you also review
            the privacy policy of our business partner or sponsor.</font></p>

            other uses may include sending you information or materials we think
            you will find interesting, or sharing the information with wwiTV's
            Media's advertisers and reputable business partners. However, at the
            time of collection, you will have the option of instructing us not
            to send you additional information or share your personal
            information with third parties. wwiTV is not responsible for the

            the fulfillment of subscriptions or requests for information you
            submit to our sites, such as sending you a newsletter. In most
            instances, wwiTV instructs these third parties to use personally
            identifiable information only for the specific purpose for which it
            is collected, and not to sell, market or transfer such information
            to other entities. If wwiTV obtains personal information that
            has been collected from you by a third party, including our business
            partners, this Privacy Policy nonetheless governs wwiTV's use of
            that information.</font></p>

            and used by people you may not know. Users under the age of 18
            should be particularly careful not to divulge any personal
            information. While wwiTV strives to protect and respect your
            privacy, we can not guarantee the security of any information you
            disclose in a chat room or bulletin board and you do so at your own
