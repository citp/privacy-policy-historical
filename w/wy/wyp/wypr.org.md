Respect for the use of this information is one of our primary responsibilities.

This information is not made available to any third party and is considered completely confidential.

From time to time WYPR may need to change this policy. Any changes will be posted to this page as soon as reasonable possible, so please check this page periodically. By using this site, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this WYPR Web Site Privacy Policy.
