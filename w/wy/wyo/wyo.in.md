# Privacy Policy | Wear Your Opinion | Social smart tees

You know, we at WYO are geeks, too. And like all good geeks, we’re obsessed with privacy. We won’t share or sell your personal information for a quick buck. And we promise we will never collect or share information about your IQ, your religious beliefs, your shoe size, or how you got that intriguing scar on your left elbow. In general terms, we collect information so we can ship your WYOs, let you enjoy our community features, and improve our website, services, and products. Or, in legalese….

WYO collects information (such as your name, shipping and billing address, credit card number, email address, etc.) from you that we need to:  
process your order;  
provide you with member support;  
allow you to use the community forums and participate in contests and other forum features; and  
send you newsletters and other communications such as polls, surveys, and special WYO offers.

WYO will set and access our own cookies on your computer to allow you to buy and interact at the site. We also use web beacons to gather anonymous, aggregated statistical information (e.g. unique hits, page views, etc.) about our website traffic.  
WYO may share information collected by us with third parties to help process your order (e.g. shipping companies, credit card processors, etc.) or to provide statistical and demographic analysis to WYO to help us and our business partners provide you with better services and offerings.

WYO will not share, rent, lease, or sell your personal information (e.g. your email address, your credit card information, your name, your address, etc.) to any third party for their independent use or benefit. Never. Ever.  
Future changes to this Privacy Policy may be made at any time by sending you an email or posting notice of the changes on the site, with the changes effective 30 days after WYO’s dispatch of the email or posting of the notice. To ask questions about this policy or to remove your personal information from our database, write us at privacy@WYO.in.
