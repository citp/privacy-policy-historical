# Privacy Policy | Wynn Las Vegas & Encore Resort

This Privacy Policy outlines the information Wynn Resorts Holdings, LLC and its affiliates (“Wynn”) will collect and how that information will be used. This privacy policy applies to all websites owned or operated by Wynn or its affiliates, including “wynnlasvegas.com”, “wynnsocial.com” and “wynnresorts.com”.

**Information We Collect**

As appropriate, Wynn may collect personally identifiable information from you voluntarily to provide you with a particular service. We may ask you for information such as name, address, telephone number and email address.

**Public Activities**

We may offer you opportunities to engage in Public Activities on the websites owned or operated by Wynn (the "Site"). "Public Activities" are any actions you take on the Site that are designed to be visible to other users, including comments, recommendations, reviews, photo submissions, or any other items or content that you submit on the Site, as well as social media activity that references Wynn, any of its properties, or any activities taking place at one of Wynn’s properties. Any information you disclose in your Public Activities, along with your user name (if any), any social media handle, or any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by Wynn for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media. If you choose to engage in Public Activities, you should be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected, or used by other users of these areas, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

Wynn has no responsibility to publish, take down, remove or edit any of your Public Activities or any of your submissions that are a result of your Public Activities. By choosing to participate in Public Activities, you are electing to share and display such Public Activities via the Site. Also, Public Activities may be included in RSS feeds, APIs and made available to other websites via other formats. As a result, your Public Activities may appear on other websites, blogs, or feeds.

 **Cookies**

A cookie is a small file stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Cookies also measure usage of various pages on our website to help us make our information more pertinent to your needs and easy for you to access, and they provide functionality that we believe would be of interest and value to you.

You may set your browser to block cookies (consult the instructions for your particular browser on how to do this), although doing so will adversely affect your ability to perform certain transactions, use certain functionality and access certain content on our website.

**Browsing**

We do not collect personally identifiable information from your computer when you browse this website and request pages from our servers. Unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide us with personally identifiable information, we will not know your name, your email address, or any other personally identifiable information. When you request a page from our website, our servers log the information provided in the HTTP request header including the IP number, the time of the request, the URL of your request and other information that is provided in the HTTP header.

**Information Use Security and Storage of Information**

All personal and general information that reaches Wynn is stored on a secure server that resides behind firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of Wynn. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our hotels or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. It is the policy of Wynn to protect the confidentiality of any social security numbers collected by Wynn, to prohibit unlawful disclosure of any social security numbers collected by Wynn and to limit and/or restrict access to any social security numbers collected by Wynn. Information collected on the sites covered by this statement is generally processed and stored in the United States.

Wynn may share your personal information with our properties, subsidiaries and select third parties as we deem appropriate. Your personal information may also be disclosed if necessary to: (1) enforce our Website Agreement; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of the Company; (3) comply with a court order or other legal process or other legal requirements of any governmental authorities, including but not limited to authorities that regulate gaming activities; or (4) governmental authorities, in the sole discretion of the Company, in exceptional circumstances, such as a national emergency, security concern, or other situation in which the Company deems such disclosure prudent.

Wynn uses the services of third parties, such as e-mail service providers and marketing companies that act as agents on behalf of Wynn. These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose Wynn specifies. We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us. We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information to entities outside of the Wynn family of companies for use without your approval.

**E-Mails About Special Offers/Promotions and Opt-Out**

It is our intention to send you only e-mail communications that will be useful to you and that you want to receive. These communications will relate to Wynn offers and/or the promotions of select, reputable third parties with whom Wynn has a strategic marketing relationship because they offer products or services that we believe would be of interest to you. We use a third-party e-mail service provider to send e-mails. This service provider is prohibited from using your e-mail address for any purpose other than to send Wynn related e-mail. When you receive an e-mail, you will be provided the choice to opt-out of future e-mails by following the instructions provided in the e-mail.

You may choose whether you provide your phone number to receive text messages or advertising phone calls from us or our agents that are made using an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice. By providing your phone number and express consent, you are choosing to receive such messages until you withdraw your consent. Your consent to receive text messages or pre-recorded calls using an automatic telephone dialing system is not required to make a purchase. You may revoke your consent at any time by contacting us at [webmaster@wynnlasvegas.com.](mailto:webmaster@wynnlasvegas.com)

**Use of Third-Party Internet Sites**

Third-party Internet sites and services accessible through Wynn Resorts have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of us. Wynn Resorts has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions.

Wynn Resorts does not knowingly or intentionally collect any personally identifiable information from, or market to, individuals under the age of 21. Pursuant to law, persons under the age of 21 are not permitted to gamble at our properties or loiter in casino areas. Similarly, our websites are not intended for persons under the age of 21.
