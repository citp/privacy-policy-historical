Our Policy  
Wyndham International respects the privacy of every individual who visits our Site or responds to our interactive advertisements. At our Site, we don't collect personally-identifiable information from individuals unless they provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. We don't require you to register or provide information to us in order to view our Site. If you register in order to use various features of our Site, we use the information you supply for the purpose of providing the services you've requested. If you agreed to follow-up contacts by us or asked us to be put on our mailing list when you registered, we may also contact you from time to time. You can always change your preference for follow-up contacts just by emailing us at any time. We don't share any personal information you give us with anyone outside of Wyndham International. 

In the email section of our Site, we ask for some personally identifiable information, such as your name, address and phone number. We use this information only if we need to contact you directly because our attempts to contact you by email were unsuccessful. We don't share your personal information with anyone outside of Wyndham International. We don't use your email address for any purpose other than responding to the message you've sent. Wyndham International does not intend to collect any personally identifiable information from individuals under thirteen years of age. Where appropriate, we will specifically instruct children not to submit such information on our websites or advertisements. If a child has provided us with personally identifiable information, a parent or guardian of that child may contact us at the email address or address listed in this Privacy Statement if they would like this information deleted from our records and we will use reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from our databases. 

Our Site sometimes includes notices of promotions we are conducting, and we may permit you to enter electronically in some cases. If that occurs, we will use the information you provide for the purpose of conducting the promotion (e.g., to contact you if you're a winner). We don't share the information you give us with anyone outside of Wyndham International. 

Wyndham treats all customer information as confidential and regularly monitors access to such information and its use within Wyndham by its employees to ensure that level of privacy described in this Policy is maintained. Wyndham has also adopted security measures intended to prevent an unauthorized third party such as a hacker from gaining access to Wyndham data bases.   
  
Cookies  
Like most companies, we use "cookie" technology on our Site. When you log in, the cookie tells us whether you've visited us before or are a new visitor. The cookie doesn't track any personal information about you or provide us with any way to contact you, and the cookie doesn't extract any information from your computer. 

Wyndham International uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.  For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to <http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy>
