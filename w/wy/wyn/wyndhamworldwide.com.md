Cookies make web surfing and browsing easier for you by saving your preferences so that we can use these to improve your next visit to this Website. 
    * One of the purposes of cookies is to simplify the use of the Website.  A cookie may save a user’s login details for example, so that the user does not need to login every time. Cookies, by themselves, do not provide us with your personal information.

    * Cookies are also used for statistical or marketing purposes, to determine how the Website is used. These cookies are provided by us as well as by third parties (e.g., advertising partners). While we do not control or have access to the advertiser cookies we do permit those cookies to be used on this Website to facilitate tailored advertising and to monitor patterns of buying specific goods or interest in - for example, holidays or hobbies.  These cookies run advertisements tailored to the user based on his online buying habits.

  * **From Other Sources** :  We may receive your personal information from other sources, such as public databases; joint marketing partners; social media platforms; from people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected on social media platforms, as well as from other third parties.  For example, if you elect to connect your social media account to your Website account, certain personal information from your social media account will be shared with us, which may include personal information that is part of your profile or your friends’ profiles.
  * **Mobile Devices:** When you use access our Services from a mobile device, we may collect information such as your unique device ID and your location information.  When you download and use the App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.

  * **Retention Period**. We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
  * At this time, we do not respond to browser ‘do not track’ signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted.  Third parties, including our service providers, may collect information about your online activities over time and across different Web sites, including when you visit our Web site.  You can learn about how to exercise choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services by visiting [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/) and [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).
