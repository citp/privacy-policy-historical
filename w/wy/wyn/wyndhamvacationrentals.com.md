# Privacy Policy - Wyndham Vacation Rentals

Resort Rental, LLC (operating as Holiday Rentals, LLC in MD and TX) ("RR") (an affiliate of RCI, LLC ("RCI")) recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of certain Information collected about the users and visitors ("user," "you" or "your") of RR's Web site ("Web Site"). The following privacy and information practices policy discloses and describes what Information RR may gather about you, how RR may use such Information, to which third parties such Information may be disclosed, and how you can correct or change such Information ("Privacy Policy"). This Privacy Policy is designed to give you an understanding about how RR collects your Information and the uses RR may make of such Information during the course of RR's business and in providing you with access to the information, products and services that may be available at this Web Site. 

You should print a copy of this Privacy Policy for your records. Please note, however, that RR may update and amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, as RR deems necessary in its sole discretion. Certain capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy may be defined in RR's separate Web site Terms and Conditions. 

In this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means any information about you from which you can be personally identified, including, without limitation, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, financial details, username, password and other information which you may disclose. 

Where you provide information that relates to a person other than yourself then you must ensure that it is lawful for you to disclose this information to us so that we can use it as described in this Privacy Policy and that if required for that purpose, that you have obtained that person's permission to do so. 

**YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

By using this Web Site, you signify your agreement to the terms of RR's Internet Privacy Policy. **IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS WEB SITE.** Your continued use of RR's Web Site following the posting of any changes or updates to the terms of this Privacy Policy will signify your acceptance of those changes and updates.

**Purpose**

RR's purpose in establishing this Privacy Policy is to balance its legitimate business interests in collecting and using its users' Information with its users' reasonable expectations of privacy. RR's intent is to provide to you certain offers, information, services and discounts that it believes are relevant to your interests. RR believes that its users will benefit from promotional activity based on certain information employed to market goods and services offered by and through its businesses.

**Affiliate Web Sites**

This Privacy Policy applies to this Web Site only. Please note that, to the extent that this Web Site permits you to link to other Web sites of RR's affiliated or related entities, or its providers, separate privacy policies may apply to those linked Web sites, which separate privacy policies may contain different terms that are not the same as those terms contained in RR's Privacy Policy. **Your access to and use of such linked Web sites through links provided on this Web Site are not governed by this Privacy Policy but, instead, are governed by the privacy policies of those linked Web sites, and RR disclaims any and all responsibility for your access to and use of such linked Web sites, as well as for any use of the Information that you may provide to, or any Information that may be collected about you at, such linked Web sites.**

**What Information Does RR Collect?**

RR gathers the following three types of Information about its users: (1) data that users provide through optional, voluntary registration on RR's Web Site; (2) data that RR gathers from third party sources or providers; and (3) data that RR gathers through aggregated anonymous tracking of use activity and usage trends, mainly by tallying Web pages that are viewed by users throughout this Web Site. You should be assured, however, that RR will not disclose any of your Personal Information (as defined above) to third parties without your consent, except as may otherwise be described in this Privacy Policy or disclosed to you when you submit the Personal Information.

**How Does RR Collect Information?**

**Optional Registration:**

RR collects Information by specifically requesting it from you. Generally, this occurs when you register at the Web Site or request information or a service or product. You may elect, at your sole option, whether to provide the requested Information, although you may not be able to use or gain access to certain portions or features of this Web Site if you elect not to provide such Information. Usually, RR and/or its business partners use your Information to operate the Web Site and to deliver information and products and services to you. RR also uses your Information to inform you about other products and/or services available from RR, its affiliated or related entities, and/or its providers.

**Information from Third Party Sources:**

RR may collect information about you from third party sources to supplement the Information otherwise provided by you at this Web Site. This supplemental information allows RR to verify Information that you have provided to RR and to enhance RR's ability to provide you with information about its businesses, products and services, as further described in RR's Web Site Terms. RR's agreements with these third party sources typically limit how RR may use this supplemental information.

**Use of Aggregate Tracking Information:**

**Use of Internet Protocol ("IP") Addresses**

An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing or browsing the Internet so that your computer can be identified by the main computers, known as "Web servers," that "serve up" Web sites and Web pages. This IP address allows RR to identify and gather general information and data about users, such as the Web pages that users may view.

RR collects IP addresses for the following purposes: (1) helping RR diagnose and resolve problems with its main computers; (2) administering its systems and this Web Site; (3) reporting aggregated anonymous information to its business partners and providers; and (4) auditing the use of this Web Site. When users request Web pages from this Web Site, RR's Web servers log the user's IP address. RR does not normally link IP addresses to any Personal Information, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user will remain anonymous to RR. For example, RR collects and/or tracks the home server domain name, the type of computer, and the type of Web browser used by you to access this Web Site. Such collection and tracking information is gathered by RR as you navigate through this Web Site and the various Web Site pages, and shall be used by RR for its business purposes only, as described above in this section.

RR can, and will, use IP addresses to identify you when RR feels it is necessary to enforce compliance with its Web Site Terms and/or this Privacy Policy, or to protect its services, Web Site, systems, information, employees, business partners, providers, users, customers or others.

**Use of Cookies**

RR may place "cookies" on your web browser. Cookies are small pieces of information or text files that a Web site sends to your computer for record-keeping purposes, which information is stored in a file on your computer's hard drive. Cookies make Web surfing and browsing easier for you by saving your preferences so that RR can use the saved information to facilitate your use of, and improve your experience with, this Web Site when you navigate at or return to this Web Site. Cookies, by themselves, do not provide RR with your individual identity or Personal Information unless you have chosen separately to provide it to RR. RR never saves passwords or credit card information in its cookies. The use of cookies is industry-standard and, as such, you will find that most major Web sites use them.

By showing, tracking or recording how and when users use this Web Site, cookies help RR see which areas of the Web Site are popular and which are not. Many of RR's improvements and updates to the Web Site and enhancements to the user experiences are based on the data and information compiled from these cookies in conjunction with the total number of users of, and Web pages viewed at, this Web Site. This data and information are most easily tracked with cookies.

Most cookies expire after a defined period of time, or you can delete or disable your cookie file(s) at any time. Most Web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your Web browser to refuse cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. You should note that some parts or features of RR's Web Site or services may not function properly or be accessible, or may be considerably slower, if you delete or refuse to accept cookies. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set certain personalized preferences, and/or may have difficulty completing marketing or other Web Site transactions.

RR has two (2) primary uses for cookies. First, RR uses cookies to identify and specify a user's preferences. Second, RR uses cookies to track Web Site usage trends and patterns. This helps RR to obtain a better understanding of its users' needs and to improve areas of this Web Site. While both of these uses and related activities are dependent upon the use of cookies, you have the option, as described above, of disabling, deleting or refusing the cookies via your Web browser preferences or similar features.

In addition, you may occasionally receive cookies from RR's business partners or providers, or when you link to other third party Web sites. RR does not control these cookies, and disclaims any responsibility relating to the use or receipt of such cookies. You should note that the use of advertising cookies sent by third party Web servers is a standard practice in the Internet industry.

**Use of Pixels**

RR and its third party ad servers may also use invisible pixels or Web beacons on this Web Site to count how many users visit certain Web pages. Information collected from invisible pixels or Web beacons is used and reported in the aggregate without the use of Personal Information. This information may be used to improve marketing programs and content, and to target RR's Internet advertisements at this Web Site and/or other web sites.

**With Whom Does RR Share Information?**

As a general rule, RR will not share with or disclose to any third parties any Personal Information that you may submit or provide to RR via this Web Site, in a manner that connects you with the Personal Information, except (a) as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, (b) when RR has your permission such as to complete a transaction you have requested, or (c) under special circumstances, such as when RR believes in good faith that the law requires such disclosure or under the circumstances described below. The following describes some of the ways that your Personal Information may be disclosed:

Affiliates: RR may share any or all of your Personal Information with and among its affiliated or related entities or family of companies. This is typically done so as to allow such entities and companies to offer to you information about their respective businesses, products and services that they believe may be of interest to you.

Business Partners & Sponsors: RR may disclose some or all of your Personal Information to third party business partners or sponsors, as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. In the event and to the extent that there are additional uses of your Personal Information by RR's business partners or sponsors (which additional uses are not otherwise described in or contemplated by this Policy), any such additional uses will be specifically described to you prior to or at the time such Personal Information is collected or prior to any transfer of such Personal Information to the business partners or sponsors. Many promotions offer opportunities for you to request additional information from such business partners and sponsors. By requesting additional information, you signify your consent to RR's transfer of your Personal Information to the applicable business partners or sponsors so that they can respond to or fulfill your request. Although in many instances only your e-mail address will be shared with these business sponsors and partners, RR is not limited to the type of Personal Information that it may disclose, provided that you requested the additional information and that RR has otherwise complied with this Privacy Policy.

In order for us to process your order or redeem your certificate it is necessary for us to disclose Personal Information to various third party business partners which include our Web Site host, payment processing partners and credit card clearing houses, couriers (in the event that we need to send certificate orders by courier), resorts and travel/accommodation providers.

Third Party & Aggregate Data: From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third parties. If you opt to receive from these third parties information related to such materials or offers, RR will (with your permission) share your name and e-mail address with such third parties. Under confidentiality agreements, RR may match Personal Information with data provided by these third parties. Also, as described above in this Privacy Policy, RR may keep track of which portions of the Web Site users are visiting and other user statistics, and aggregate this information to help RR create a better experience for users of this Web Site. This is all done without knowing your name or other Personal Information, and allows RR (in addition to other lawful purposes) to describe its users' preferences, and the types of services in which the users may be interested, to its business partners, advertisers, sponsors and other third parties.

Other: RR may also disclose account information in special cases when it has reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the Web Site Terms or this Privacy Policy, or may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with any of RR's rights or property, other users, or anyone else. RR may disclose or access account information when it believes in good faith that the law requires it (and/or if compelled to do so by law enforcement or government agencies, or by other legal action), and for administrative and other purposes that it deems necessary to maintain, service, and/or improve this Web Site or its products and services.

Children: This Web Site is not intended for use by children. RR does not knowingly solicit or collect Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, you must obtain the consent of your parent or guardian to use this Web Site.

**Opting Out; How Can You Control the Use of Information?**

In the event that you decide that you want to opt out from RR's use of any Personal Information that you previously provided to (and/or authorized for use by) RR, or if any of your Personal Information (such as your zip code or e-mail address) changes, you may follow the procedure below. RR makes repeated efforts to verify the accuracy of your Personal Information and to correct and update its databases based on the information available to RR. In the event that you believe that any Personal Information held by RR is inaccurate or outdated, RR, upon notification and sufficient time for verification, will take all reasonable steps to correct any inaccuracy or update outdated Personal Information of which it is made aware. RR also gives you the opportunity to control or opt out from the communications that RR directs to you.

You can also ask to access any of the Personal Information we hold about you. These rights are in addition to your rights to request that your Personal Information is updated or corrected or is not used for direct marketing purposes.

If you would like to opt out from any use or communication described in this Privacy Policy for any reason, you may make that request by clicking [**www.wyndhamrentals.com/unsubscribe**](https://web.archive.org/unsubscribe) and you will be permanently removed from our contact list.

**What Happens When You Link to a Third Party Site?**

You should be aware that, when you are on RR's Web Site, you may be able to hyperlink, or may be directed, to other third party Web sites that are beyond RR's control and/or outside of its services. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement or a RR search result, the "click" may transfer you off this Web Site and to another unaffiliated Web site. These other Web sites may include sites of advertisers, sponsors, providers and/or partners that may use RR's and/or RR's affiliated or related entities' logos as part of a co-branding agreement. These other Web sites may send their own cookies to, or collect or solicit Information from, users. RR does not control such third parties or their Web sites, and, therefore, is not responsible for the contents of these Web sites or the hyperlinks or advertising placed on such Web sites. RR's inclusion in this Web Site of hyperlinks to these other third party Web sites does not imply any endorsement of the material on such other Web sites or any association with the third party operators. This Privacy Policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet and/or that is beyond RR's control.

Please keep in mind that whenever you give out information over the Internet or Web or otherwise in on-line environments (for example, via message boards or forums), such information can be collected and used by people you do not know. While RR strives to protect users' information and privacy, RR cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose in these environments, and you disclose such information at your own risk.

**Where is your information?**

All Personal Information will be processed and stored by RR in the United States. United States laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your jurisdiction.

**Is Your Information Secure?**

The security of all Information associated with users of this Web Site is an important concern to RR. RR exercises reasonable care in providing secure transmission of your Information from your computer to RR's servers and databases. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while RR strives to protect your Information, RR cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Information you transmit to RR, and you do so at your own risk. Once you complete the transmission of, and RR receives, your Information, RR uses industry standard efforts and practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your Personal Information, and uses commercially reasonable efforts to collect and secure such Personal Information consistent with all applicable laws and regulations. RR takes commercially reasonable efforts to use a variety of different security measures (such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers) designed to protect Personal Information from access by unauthorized users both inside and outside of RR, and to protect against the unauthorized or improper alteration or destruction of such Personal Information. RR's communication system, software and database practices have been designed to aid in supporting authenticity, integrity and confidentiality. However, as described above, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet and, despite these reasonable efforts by RR to maintain data and Information security, RR cannot guarantee the security of data or Information.

Effective date: This policy was last updated on December 15, 2010.
