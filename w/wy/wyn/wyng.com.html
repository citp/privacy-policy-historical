Revised: 6.6.01
<p><br>
  PRIVACY STATEMENT</p>
<p>This site "www.wyng.com" is owned by Clear Channel Communications, Inc., and is part 
  of the Clear Channel family of companies which includes other quality entertainment 
  brands such as broadcast and Internet radio stations, television stations, SFX 
  Entertainment, and the Premiere Radio Network (collectively referred to hereinafter 
  as "we" or "this site"). This statement informs you of Clear 
  Channel's practices with respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal 
  information. Personal information is information that allows us to contact you 
  (such as e-mail address, home address, or telephone number) or other information 
  that, when linked to your name or contact information, allows us to personalize 
  your visit to our site by providing you with information that suits your interests. 
</p>
<p>Clear Channel is the owner of this website and retains all ownership rights 
  to the information collected at this site. Clear Channel reserves the right 
  to change, modify, add, or remove provisions of this Privacy Statement. Any 
  changes to this Statement will be posted here, and we encourage you to check 
  back from time to time.</p>
<p><br>
  Personalization</p>
<p>Although you may use many features of this site without completing a registration 
  or sign up form, visitors who do register and/or sign up for special services 
  may have access to additional features of the site and are more likely to receive 
  information suited to their interests. For example, a registered user is eligible 
  for additional services provided by this website such as listener clubs and 
  personalized content. Our registration and special services sign up forms may 
  ask you for contact information (like name or email address) and demographic 
  information (like zip code or age). You must provide the information in order 
  to receive the benefits of registration or of the special service. </p>
<p>We may use the contact information that you give us to better tailor your website 
  experience to your interests, and to send you information about Clear Channel 
  and its services as well as promotional material on behalf of some of our partners. 
  We use other information that you provide to us to show you content in which 
  you may be interested and to display the content according to your preferences. 
  We will also share this information within the Clear Channel family in order 
  to enhance your experience on this and other Clear Channel websites. </p>
<p>In addition, we may share this information with advertisers or other third 
  parties that are not part of the Clear Channel family on an aggregate or other 
  basis that does not disclose your identity or contact information. </p>
<p>Online Surveys/Contests</p>
<p>From time to time, we may conduct online surveys and contests. These ask you 
  for contact information (like name or email address) and demographic information 
  (like zip code or age). We may use this contact information from our surveys 
  and contests to provide you with information about our company and promotional 
  material on behalf of some of our partners, and to contact you when necessary. 
</p>
<p><br>
  Supplemental Information</p>
<p>To enhance Clear Channel's ability to tailor this site to your preferences, 
  we may combine information that you provide us on registration and other online 
  sign up forms with other information about you that we may obtain. We do not 
  share that information with any other party.</p>
<p><br>
  Shopping/Commercial Services</p>
<p>This Clear Channel site may offer shopping services, which may be offered by 
  us or by a firm that operates a store under contract with us. If our site offers 
  shopping or other commercial services, you will use a customer order form to 
  request information, products, and services. The order form will ask you to 
  give us contact information (like name or email address), financial information 
  (like account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like zip 
  code or age).</p>
<p>We will use the financial information that you provide to bill you for products 
  and services. By giving our site your credit card and related personal information, 
  you are authorizing our store to give that information to the merchant and credit 
  card company in order to confirm and fulfill your order.</p>
<p>We will use contact information from the order form to fulfill your orders. 
  We may also use contact data to get in touch with you when necessary. We will 
  not otherwise use or distribute your financial information without your prior 
  approval. </p>
<p><br>
  Public Forums </p>
<p>This site may make available chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups. 
  Please remember that any information that you disclose in these areas becomes 
  public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose 
  your personal information. </p>
<p><br>
  Third Parties</p>
<p>From time to time we may enter into a special relationship with another company 
  that is not owned by Clear Channel to provide additional features at this site. 
  These special relationships may include "powered by" partners, business 
  partners, sponsors, and co-branded sites (referred to here as "co-branded 
  pages"). These might include, for example, pages that share our name and 
  that of another entity, such as TicketMaster. </p>
<p>You should look for a specific privacy statement on any such co-branded page. 
  Any personal information that you provide when signing up at one of these co-branded 
  pages may be shared with our third party partner. You should also check our 
  partner's website for information regarding its privacy policies. </p>
<p>In addition, we may share any of the information collected from you with these 
  other non-Clear Channel companies on an aggregate basis. The aggregated information 
  is not linked to any information that can identify you. </p>
<p><br>
  IP Address</p>
<p>We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer 
  our website, to help identify you and your shopping cart, and to gather broad 
  demographic information for aggregate use. We do not link IP addresses to personal 
  information.</p>
<p><br>
  Cookies</p>
<p>This Clear Channel site may use a standard technology called a "cookie" 
  to collect information about how you use the site. Cookies reside on your computer, 
  and help our website to recognize your computer's browser as a previous visitor. 
  This information allows us to customize delivery of information. For example, 
  our site may use cookies to save and remember registration information or preferences 
  that you may have set while you were browsing the site, to keep track of your 
  shopping cart, to ensure you don't see the same ad repeatedly, to deliver content 
  specific to your interests, and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter 
  it each time you visit our site. We use cookies only to gather information as 
  indicated in this policy. </p>
<p>In addition, on occasion our site may also set a "session cookie" 
  which cookie helps us administer the site. A session cookie expires when you 
  close your browser, and does not retain any information about you after it expires. 
</p>
<p><br>
  Log Files</p>
<p>We may use IP addresses to administer the site, to analyze trends, track users' 
  webpage movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 
</p>
<p><br>
  Banner Advertising</p>
<p>We license ad-server software from another company to place banner advertising 
  on our sites. All of the data provided and generated by the ad-server software 
  remains in our possession, and no data is transferred to the licensor of the 
  software. This feature of our site may, on occasion, set "cookies" 
  on your computer. Any information collected or stored by the ad-service or the 
  cookie is treated in the same manner as other information as described in this 
  statement. </p>
<p><br>
  Children's Personal Information </p>
<p>Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act:</p>
<p>· This site does NOT collect, use, or disclose personal information 
  (including online contact information) of children under the age of 13. <br>
  <br>
  · In the event that a child under the age of 13 attempts to register 
  on our site, we will NOT accept the registration and will delete information 
  received from the child. <br>
  <br>
  · In the event that a child posts personal information in a public forum 
  such as a chat room, we will attempt to delete that information once we become 
  aware of it. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Your Choices<br>
  <br>
  This Clear Channel site provides you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving 
  e-mail communications from us and our special relationship partners. As explained 
  above, if you choose not to provide us with information sought on registration 
  or sign up forms, it is possible that you will not be able to access or use 
  certain features of our site. If you do choose to opt-out of such e-mail communications, 
  you may:<br>

  · Send an email to <a href="mailto:ccinhelp@clearchannel.com">ccinhelp@clearchannel.com.com</a> <br>
  · Click <a href="http://WYNG-FM.hybrid.4mda.net/PHP_Preferences"><b>HERE</b></a></p>
<p><br>
  Access to Personal Information</p>
<p>Clear Channel gives you the opportunity to modify or remove personal information 
  that you have provided to us. You may do so by modifying your password-protected 
  registered user information on our website. </p>
<p><br>
  Security of Your Personal Information</p>
<p>Clear Channel employs reasonable security measures consistent with standard 
  industry practice, for information collected through this website. We believe 
  that we have adequate security measures in place in our physical facilities 
  to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information that we 
  collect on our website. We also use internal protections to limit access to 
  users' personal information to only those employees who need the information 
  to perform a specific job.</p>
<p><br>
  Sale or Merger </p>
<p>If this site is sold to, or merges with, another company not owned by Clear 
  Channel, you should expect that some or all of the information collected from 
  this website may be transferred to the buyer/surviving company. If so, Clear 
  Channel will seek to obligate the acquiring company to use any personal information 
  transferred by this site in a manner consistent with this statement, but cannot 
  guarantee that it will be able to impose that requirement or that the acquiring 
  company will comply.</p>
<p><br>
  Legal Process</p>
<p> You should be aware that Clear Channel may be required to disclose your personal 
  information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, 
  such as in court or regulatory proceedings. </p>

  privacy practices or the content of these websites. You should check the Privacy 
  Statement of the website sponsor when linking to other sites. </p>
