This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect, transmit, and store information about our users. This Privacy Policy is not a contract and does not create any legal rights. Providing your information is voluntary and your use of the site after the effective date of this document constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.

##  Information We Collect

In order to help you get the most out of our service, we collect user submitted personally identifiable information when you use the site. We only ask site users to submit the minimum amount of information necessary to use our service. Such information may include your name, password, zip code, email address, and phone number for communication purposes. Information may be submitted to the WyzAnt website or via phone or email when communicating with a WyzAnt representative. For students and parents, we may collect information related to your documentation of and payment for tutoring sessions. For tutors, we may collect your Social Security number (SSN) or Federal Employer Identification number (FEIN) for tax purposes or to complete a background check. As detailed in the "Data Transmission and Storage" section below, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption on any page of the site where we ask you to submit personally identifiable information and encrypt all such information for safe storage in our system.

We also gather non-personally identifiable information when you use the site. Such data is compiled in aggregate and includes things like the referring URL and the type of browser you may be using to access the site. This data is used to better understand and enhance the user experience on the site.

##  Data Transmission and Storage

WyzAnt is committed to keeping your information private and secure. We use industry-standard 128-bit SSL encryption when collecting and transmitting your information through the system. Once information has been collected, we encrypt sensitive data in our database for added security. WyzAnt also uses firewalls and hardware monitoring across our system to protect against unauthorized access.

##  Financial Information

If you elect to pay for tutoring lessons with a credit card, we will collect your name, credit card number, expiration date, and address information associated with the account. All financial information is collected securely and encrypted in our system in full compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

If you are a tutor and elect to pay for a background check, we will collect credit card information to order a background check on your behalf. Payment information entered into our system solely to procure a background check will not be stored on our servers.

##  Use of Cookies

WyzAnt may disclose personal information when we believe such action is necessary to comply with the law or enforce or apply our Terms of Service. In the event of a change in control of WyzAnt’s business, personal information may be exchanged as part of a merger, sale, or other business transfer. If such a transfer makes a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you of any changes.
