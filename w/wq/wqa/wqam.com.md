                                 Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc.
                                        Privacy Policy
Last Updated and Effective – March 6, 2014
This Privacy Policy has been updated to include a section regarding your California
privacy rights if you are a resident of California, broaden the definition of Personal
Information to include Internet Protocol (“IP”) Address and other persistent identifiers
under certain circumstances, and to add a statement in compliance with amendments to
the California Online Privacy Protection Act regarding disclosures how we will honor
browser Do Not Track settings that restrict serving targeted advertising across various
third party websites. We have not materially changed our use or disclosure of your
Personal Information.
 Privacy Policy
 The following discloses the privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) related to information
 collected from users through the Platforms owned and operated Beasley Broadcast
 Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively “Beasley,” “we”, “us”, or “our”), including,
 web properties, web pages, interactive features, iRadioNow, Apps, widgets, blogs, text
 message promotions, in addition to Twitter, Facebook or other social networking sites,
 and any other website or online service that includes an authorized link to this Privacy
 Policy, whether accessed via computer, mobile device or other technology platforms.
 (For a list of Platforms, click here.)
This Privacy Policy has been incorporated by reference into our Terms of Service
(“TOS”). Any capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy will have the same
meaning as defined in our TOS or Text Message Promotions Terms & Conditions.
 By visiting and using our Platforms, you accept the practices described in this Privacy
 Policy. If you do not want your Personal Information collected or used, please do not
 use our Platforms.
    1. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
If you are a California resident and have an established business relationship with
Beasley and want to receive information about our online opt-out/opt-in policies of
sharing your Personal Information with affiliated or non-affiliated third parties, and how
to exercise your disclosure choices, please send your written request following the
instructions below. We will not accept requests via the telephone or facsimile.
         • For all requests, include your full name, street address, city, state and zip
             code, and the name of the Beasley Platform to which you are requesting the
             information.
         • In your email request, you must state “Your California Privacy Rights” in
             the subject line and send your email to: privacy@bbgi.com.
         • In your postal request, you must send a letter or post card to:
             Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc.
             3033 Riviera Drive, Suite 200
             Naples, FL 34103
             Attention: Your California Privacy Rights c/o Privacy Coordinator


Beasley is not responsible for responding to notices that are not labeled, or not sent
properly, or do not have complete information. Non-affiliated third parties are
independent from Beasley and if you wish to receive information about your disclosure
choices or stop communications from such third parties after we have shared your
Personal Information with them, you will need to contact those non-affiliated third parties
directly.
     2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT & HOW WE USE IT
 The Platforms may ask you to provide information that could reasonably be used to
 contact you or to identify you personally (such as your name, email address, telephone
 number, text message ID, home address, gender, birth date, your interests or other
 profile-related information (“Personal Information”). For example, Beasley will collect
 Personal Information when you register on the Platforms, request information, submit
 comments or participate in a promotion, survey or other feature of the Platforms, or
 otherwise communicate or interact with us. Beasley, for purposes of this Privacy
 Policy, includes our Operational Service Providers, who provide internal support for
 our Platforms.
         We work closely with certain third parties called Operational Service Providers
        who may perform functions on our behalf in order to carry out your requests, to
        make various features, services and materials available to you through the
        Platforms and to respond to your inquiries. Consequently, we will share your
        Personal Information with companies or individuals that host or operate our
        Platforms, analyze data or provide customer service; administer our promotions
        or provide marketing or promotional assistance (such as in connection with
        winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law, such as on a winners
        list). Third parties that process credit card payments are independent third parties
        that handle your transaction without our control or access to your Personal
        Information. These companies are solely responsible for the financial transaction
        and the collection, use, and handling of your Personal Information.]
We will also collect data that can be reasonably linked to a specific consumer, computer
or device. For example, Beasley automatically collects your Internet protocol address
(“IP Address”), or unique device identifiers for mobile devices (“UDID”) when you
access our Platforms. Such information was traditionally classified as non-Personal
Information because it did not identify a specific user. An IP Address and UDID are
numbers or code that are automatically assigned to your computer or device,
respectively, when you access a Platform.
 Our computers identify your computer or device by them. We will use this information
 to administer the Platforms, help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends,
 track users’ web page movements to help improve our Platforms, help identify you and
 your shopping preferences, song history, and gather broad demographic information for
 aggregate use. We will also use such information to customize your experience on our
 Platforms by monitoring your usage, search and transaction history and using such
 information to offer targeted advertising. When IP Address or UDID are associated or
 linked with other Personal Information, or used to monitor usage, search and
 transaction history or build a user profile for the purposes of customizing your


experience on our Platforms, such information will be classified as Personal
Information to the extent required by applicable law.
Whenever you visit or interact with the Platforms, Beasley, as well as any third-party
Advertisers, will automatically collect non-Personal Information, such as, browser type,
device type, operating system, the preceding page views, and your use of features or
applications on the Platforms. This information helps us to improve the design and
content of our Platforms and our Advertisers use such information to measure your
interaction and interest in a particular ad.
Beasley uses the Personal Information collected about and from you for a variety of
business purposes, including internal business purposes and to: respond to your
questions and requests; provide you with access to certain areas and features of the
Platforms such as your favorite stations, your musical preferences, songs you have
listened to, shared playlists and your interaction with other users; verify your identity;
communicate with you; tailor content, provide advertisements and offers; process
applications and transactions; and for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your
Personal Information or otherwise with your consent. To the extent that you purchase a
good, service or event through the Platforms, your payment transaction will be handled
by an independent third party, such as PayPal. We do not collect, use or have any access
to your credit card data, checking or other financial account information. By submitting
your credit card and related personal information to the payment transaction provider,
you understand, acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for such
transactions. We will use contact information from the order form to fulfill your orders.
We may also combine your Personal Information with Non-Personal Information and
combine your Personal Information collected offline with that collected online, and/or
from other sources such as our Facebook, Twitter and other social network sites, our
affiliates, and Operational Service Providers.
 Cookies and Other Technology
 To enhance and customize your experience with our Platforms, many of our Platforms
 use cookies, pixel tags and other similar technology. If you would prefer not to accept
 cookies, you can change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie,
 which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; or set your browser to automatically
 not accept any cookies. However, please be aware that some features and services on
 our Platforms may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and
 associate you with your Beasley account(s).
 Cookies are data files placed on a device when it is used to visit the Platforms. Cookies
 by themselves, do not tell us your email address or other Personal Information unless
 you choose to provide this information to us, by, for example, registering at one of our
 Platforms. Once you choose to furnish the Platform with Personal Information this
 information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. Beasley, or our third-party
 Operational Service Providers, may place cookies or similar files on your device for
 security purposes, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while
 visiting our Platforms. Cookies allow us to collect technical and navigational
 information, such as browser type, your time spent on our Platforms and the pages you
 have visited. Cookies also allow us to improve the content and offerings on our
 Platforms, and to store certain information about you so that you do not have to


 complete an entirely new registration process each time you visit or so that you can use
 a shopping cart.
        A pixel tag is a transparent graphic image, sometimes called a web beacon or
        tracking beacon, placed on a web page to monitor the behavior and collect data
        about the visitors viewing that page. In addition, a pixel tag may tell your
        browser to get content from another server.]
 The cookies and pixel tags on Beasley’s Platforms are set only by us and by companies
 with whom we work, such as our Operational Service Providers and Advertisers. We
 do not control an Advertiser’s cookies or business practices and only offer you access
 to the opt-out tools provided below. See “Our Advertising Practices” section for more
 information about the types of Advertising we provide.
    3. SHARING OF INFORMATION
Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose any of your Personal
Information to any third parties without your specific consent. We will share your
Personal Information under the following circumstances:
        •   To Beasley affiliates for business, operational, promotional and marketing
            purposes.
        •   To Advertisers if you participate in a co-branded, co-sponsored, or jointly
            presented promotion/contest, survey, voting feature, or service, and/or to serve
            personalized or targeted advertising.
        •   To our Operational Service Providers, who are prohibited from using your
            Personal Information for any purpose not authorized by us or required by law.
        •   To protect the security of our Platforms, servers, network systems, and
            databases.
        •   To protect our users, affiliates, Advertisers, and Operational Service Providers
            against liability and harm.
        •   To implement and enforce our TOS and any other legal document or contract
            related to our Services.
        •   To respond to subpoenas, judicial processes, or government requests and
            investigations.
        •   To act in response to an emergency or situation that threatens the life, health
            or security of an individual, and to assist in the investigation of a violation (or
            presumed violation) of law, or if we believe in good faith that the law requires
            or authorizes such disclosure.
        •   In connection with any proposed or actual purchase, sale, lease, merger,
            assignment, re-organization or financing of all or any portion of Beasley, our
            Platforms, Stations, or any of the business, assets or shares of our company(s)
            and affiliates.
We may also share your Personal Information as disclosed to you at the time you register,
subscribe, or use a particular Platform, or participate in an activity or feature on a Platform.
We will use, disclose and process any Non-Personal Information collected from you in
any manner and any Personal Information you make public.


Our Advertising Practices
Advertising supports the various free Platforms, features and activities that we provide.
We license and/or utilize technology to serve targeted and non-targeted advertisements
on our Platforms and within our content as that content is served across the Internet.
Here’s a description of the types of advertising that we may provide to you, Contextual,
First-Party, and Third-Party. In addition, we may also use third party ad network
providers to help present advertisements on the Platforms, as well as third party
analytics vendors to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of our
Platforms and viewing of our content. For more information about how targeted
Network Advertising works, please visit: http://www.youradchoices.com/ or
http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising.
       •   Contextual Advertising: We may serve you an advertisement for brakes and shocks
           based on a used car dealer ad you just viewed or a search you’ve made about used
           cars on one of our Platforms; this type of relevant advertising based on particular
           content or search query is called “Contextual Advertising” because it is based on the
           context of how you used our Platforms. We do not collect any other information
           about you for Contextual Advertising.
       •   First Party Advertising: Advertising that is tailored or personalized based on a
           history of your use of content and participation in features and activities on our
           Platforms (and may be combined with information from our Facebook Fan page or
           our other social network sites) over time is based solely on a combination of
           information that Beasley or its Operational Service Providers collect from you – not
           from your use of other websites or third parties. We may share such information
           anonymously with our Advertisers in order to measure the effectiveness of ads on our
           Platforms, such as how many users opened or acted on a particular ad.
       •
           Network Advertising: Information about your use of our Platforms combined with
           similar information about your overall Internet usage across different third party
           websites or online services used to serve tailored and personalized advertising is
           generally called “Network Advertising.” Multiple third party websites and online
           services are involved in this tailored or personalized advertising process, in essence a
           “network” of advertising providers. Such information about you could include
           information about your browser, computer, and/or mobile device and general
           information about your demographics (whether you have provided such information
           voluntarily or such information is estimated based on your usage history and
           interests), such as your gender, age, lifestyle, education, home ownership, geographic
           location, etc. See below for more information about how to identify a Network
           Advertising ad.
       For advertising that is part of a Network Advertising service, you should see a small
       symbol (also called an icon) attached to a banner ad or other targeted advertising on
       certain Platforms that can be clicked open for information about why and how you are
       receiving a particular ad. For more information see www.aboutads.info.
You may opt-out of third party targeted advertising served by Network Advertising
service providers in two ways: 1) By directly notifying a Network Advertising service
provider via its opt-out tools or 2) via your browser’s Do Not Track (“DNT”) settings
to indicate that you do not wish to receive targeted advertising based on your overall


internet usage. For more information about DNT and how it works, please visit the
Future of Privacy Forum’s website: http://www.allaboutdnt.com/.
Beasley will make a good faith reasonable effort to honor your DNT browser settings
for opting out of receiving targeted third party advertising based on your overall
Internet usage. Please note that various browsers frequently update technology or
change their settings and business practices without advance notice, and we may not
have the latest information on how to honor your preferences. If you exercise either
opt-out option – the cookie opt-out or the browser opt-out – you will continue to
receive advertising, but such advertising may not relate to your specific interests,
previous purchases or search history.
However, you cannot opt-out of our contextual or first party advertising, which is based
on your usage of only our Platforms and may be combined with your usage of our
social media sites. We will continue to serve you contextual and first party advertising.
We will also continue to monitor your usage and search or transaction history to
provide us with analytics on how well our Platforms, advertisements and features and
activities are functioning and used. We will also share this information in an aggregated
form (meaning that no one individual person can be identified) to our Advertisers or
potential Advertisers.
Other Advertisers on our Platforms may also use cookies or other similar technology to
determine your interest in particular products and services based on your internet
usage, search and transaction history across third party sites and will serve targeted
advertising based on such information. We control our own use of cookies and other
technology. This Privacy Policy does not govern cookies or other technology placed by
Advertisers.
   4. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM/BY THIRD
       PARTIES
You may choose to participate in a third party application or feature (such as
Facebook or Twitter applications or a similar application or feature on a third party
website) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to collect and/or
share) information about you, including Personal Information such as lists of your
friends, “Likes”, comments you have shared, groups and location. In addition, we
may receive information about you if other users of a third party website give us
access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections” or information about
you is otherwise accessible through your profile page or similar page on a social
networking or other third party website or interactive service.
The Platforms may make available to you public areas such as chat rooms, forums,
message boards, and news groups and may contain links to other sites that we do not
own or operate whose information practices may be different from ours. This includes
links from Advertisers that may use our logo(s) as part of a co-branding or co-
marketing agreement. We do not control, recommend or endorse and are not
responsible for these sites or their content, products, services or privacy policies or
practices. These other websites may send their own cookies to your device, they may
independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have
their own published privacy policies. Please remember that any information that you
disclose in public areas becomes public information and is not subject to the


 protections and disclosure restrictions in this Privacy Policy. You should also
 independently assess the authenticity of any website which appears or claims that it is
 one of our Platforms (including those linked to through an email or social networking
 page).
 Any Personal Information submitted directly to an independent payment transaction
 provider for purchase of goods, services and events on our Platforms is governed by the
 payment provider’s terms of service and privacy policy.
 Visitors should consult all third party website privacy policies as Beasley has no control
 or responsibility over information that is submitted to, or collected by these third
 parties.
    5. CHANGING, DELETING OR VERIFYING PERSONAL INFORMATION.
 If you wish to modify, verify, correct, or delete any of your Personal Information
 collected through the Platforms, you may edit your registered user information. It is not
 always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our
 databases without some residual data due to technical limitations of our systems, or
 retention and/or record keeping requirements under federal and state law. Please be
 aware that we do not control certain privacy settings and preferences maintained by
 social media partners like Facebook and Twitter. If you wish to make changes to those
 settings and preferences, you may do so by visiting the settings page of the appropriate
 social media site.
    6. NOTE FOR PARENTS
The Platforms are not directed to children under 13. Beasley adheres to the Children’s
Online Privacy Protection Act. Generally, we do not knowingly solicit, collect, use or
disclose personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age. If we
determine upon collection that a user is under this age, we will not use or maintain
his/her Personal Information without the parent/guardian’s consent, unless retaining such
information is required by statute, rule or regulation. For example, we are required by the
Federal Communications Commission to retain any correspondence received from a
listener related to our programming and operations in a public inspection file, and that
would include correspondence from a child. If we become aware that we have
unknowingly collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of
13 that does not qualify for a legal exception, we will make reasonable efforts to delete
such information to the extent technically possible from our records.
    7. UPDATES AND EFFECTIVE DATE.
From time to time we may change, modify, add or remove information on the
Platforms and/or this Privacy Policy, at any time without prior notice to you. Any
changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy
on the Platforms and we encourage you to check back from time to time.
    8. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION.


  Although we take appropriate and reasonable measures to help protect against the loss,
  misuse, unauthorized disclosure, or alteration of your Personal Information, we cannot
  guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us. If we collect sensitive
  Personal Information such as credit card data, we will do so via a secured transmission
  standard or protocol, or engage a third party to do so. Despite our best efforts, no
  security measures are impenetrable, and transmissions or transactions over the Internet
  are not 100% secure or error free. You use the Platforms and provide us with your
  information at your own risk.
