If you would prefer not to receive cookies, you can alter your security settings on your web browser to disable cookies or to warn you when cookies are being used. However, by disabling the cookie function in your web browser you may impede your ability to use parts of the site. 

## ▲Top 2\. Use and disclosure of information 

The symptom and disease information that you provide to us via emails, chatgroups, chatrooms, discussion forums, surveys, comment forms, or feedback forms may be used for two primary purposes. First it will be used for statistical purposes and may be provided to third party researchers. Secondly, it may be used for the _Adviware_ website (e.g. published on the web site), published in medical journals, books or magazines. 

Specifically, _Adviware_ will not use or disclose or permit the use or disclosure of information that could be used to identify an individual member in any circumstances except: 

(a) to ensure the proper functioning of the _Adviware_ website; and 

(b) where personal information is to be used by a participating third party contracted to _Adviware_ for research and where the participating third party is bound by a confidentiality agreement with _Adviware_. 

Your information may also be used or disclosed if: 

(a) _Adviware_ is required or authorised by law or if it is reasonably necessary to enforce the law; the information is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim; or 

(b) the necessary authorities (i.e. police, ambulance and fire services) are to believe on reasonable grounds that disclosure is necessary to prevent a threat to life or health; 

(c) you have given express consent to _Adviware_ for a prescribed purpose, including but not limited to, your providing information to us via email, chatgroups, chatrooms, discussion forums, surveys, comment forms, or feedback forms. With regard to any information that you submit to the website or Adviware for any purposes, you expressly grant Adviware a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use such materials, and to use or modify the materials in any way including, but not limited to, not identifying you as its author. 

_Adviware_ will not sell, distribute, rent, licence, disclose or reveal, share or pass your personally identifiable information onto any third parties, other than those who are contracted to _Adviware_ to keep the information confidential subject to the Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and regulations regarding the handling of personal information.

## ▲Top 4\. Security of your information 

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that all information you provide to us that we use or disclose is stored in a secure environment accessed only by authorised _Adviware_ personnel. Please keep in mind that no information transmitted over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We will endeavour to protect your personal information, however we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from our online services. These activities are conducted at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we will use our reasonable efforts to ensure its security. However, as a small company, the extent to which _Adviware_ can protect such information and maintain security is limited. 

## ▲Top5\. Credit Card Information 

_Adviware_ does not currently accept credit card details directly. Instead, our partners such as Amazon.com process credit card transactions without distributing this information to us. For example, credit card details for orders at our Amazon Zshop are handled by Amazon Payments and are not seen by us. Email and shipping addresses are provided for us to ship product, but we do not see your billing details. Furthermore, for ordinary Amazom.com book, magazine or other referral sales that bypass our Amazon Zshop, we do not even receive email addresses or personal information, let alone credit card details. If for any reason we do receive your credit card details, we will use such information only in order to perform credit card verification and transaction approval. Our partners that collect credit card information may use this information in accordance with their own privacy or other policies and this is beyond our control.
