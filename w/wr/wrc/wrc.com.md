### **6\. Social Plugins**

Our website uses social plugins ("Plugins") currently from the following social networks: facebook.com ("Facebook") and micro-blogging service twitter.com ("Twitter").  
Facebook is a social network, operated by Facebook Inc. (1601 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA). When you visit a page of our website that contains a Facebook Plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to Facebook servers. Facebook directly transfers the Plugin content to your browser, which embeds the latter into the website, enabling Facebook to receive information about you having accessed the respective page of our website. We have no influence on the data gathered by the Plugin and inform you according to our state of knowledge. If you are logged into Facebook, your visit can be assigned to your Facebook account. If you interact with the Plugins, for example by clicking “Like”, or by entering a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted from your browser directly to Facebook and stored by it. If you are a Facebook member and do not want Facebook to connect the data concerning your visit to our website with your member data already stored by Facebook, please log off Facebook before entering our website. Even if you are not logged into Facebook, there is a possibility that the Plugins transmit your IP-address to Facebook. For the information on the purpose and scope of data collection and procession by Facebook, as well as your rights in this respect and settings options for protecting your privacy please visit Facebook's privacy policy: www.facebook.com/policy.php. Further you can block Facebook Plugins by using add-ons for your browser, like the “Facebook Blocker“.

Twitter is a micro-blogging service, provided by Twitter Inc. (795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA). When you visit a page on our website that includes such a Plugin, your browser connects directly with the servers at Twitter. The content of the Plugin is transferred from Twitter directly to your browser, which incorporates it into the website. For this reason, we have no influence on the amount of data gathered by Twitter with the aid of this Plugin. We provide this information to the best of our knowledge, which is that only the IP address of your connection and the URL of our website are transmitted when the Plugin is acquired, but are not used for purposes other than display of the content in the Plugin.
