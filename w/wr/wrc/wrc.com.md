### 8\. Cookies and other technologies

8.1           We collect information automatically through the use of ‘cookies’. Cookies may be set by us, or they may be set by third parties. A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of information that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as a tag that distinguishes your computer but does not name you. Some of our Website pages use cookies to better serve you when you return to the Website. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies; however, if you do this, some of our Website may not work properly.

8.2           We also make use of ‘web beacons’ also commonly known as ‘single pixel GIFs’, ‘clear GIFs’ or ‘tags’. Web beacons are small graphic images that may be included on our Website. Web beacons allow us optimise our products and services and provide us and third-party partners with analytics information, such as how many visitors our Website receives. We may also use web beacons in our email correspondence to determine whether you open them or take any further action. We also work with other organisations to place our web beacons on their websites or in their advertisements. We do this to helps us develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on our Website results in a purchase or other interaction on the advertiser's website.

8.3           For our Apps, we collect information automatically through the use of unique device identifiers (" **IDs** "). An ID is a specific string of numbers and letters (a ‘character string’) which is assigned to your device, but does not name you. The ID allows us and our selected third parties to track your behaviour when you use the App. Almost every App uses ID technology. IDs serve a number of purposes such as remembering your preferences, and generally improving your user experience. IDs may tell us, for example, whether you have used our Apps before or whether you are a new user. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see through the Apps are more relevant to you and your interests. This functionality makes IDs extremely useful to improve your user experience.

8.4           For information about the specific cookies, web beacons and IDs used on our Website please refer to our [Cookies Policy](http://www.wrc.com/en/footer/information/privacy-policy/cookie-policy/page/3208----.html)

9.2           In some pages of our Website, third parties that provide content, applications or plug-ins through our Website may track your use of content, applications and plug-ins or customise content, applications and plug-ins for you.
