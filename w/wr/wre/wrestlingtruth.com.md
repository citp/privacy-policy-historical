### Embedded content from other websites

### Cookies

To improve your experience on our site or in the process of delivering personalised ads, we and our partners may use ‘cookies’. Cookies are an industry standard and most major websites use them. A cookie is a small text file that our site may place on your computer as a tool to remember your preferences and browsing information. You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings.

### Analytics

Our website uses Google Analytics, a service which transmits website traffic data to Google servers in the United States. Google Analytics does not identify individual users or associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. We use reports provided by Google Analytics to help us understand website traffic and webpage usage.

By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner described in [Google’s Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/) and for the purposes set out above. You can opt out of Google Analytics if you disable or refuse the cookie, disable JavaScript, or use the[ opt-out service provided by Google](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

### Third Party Advertisers

We use third-party advertising companies, including Google AdSense, to display ads on some of our pages. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

Specifically, the [DoubleClick cookie](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/2839090) is used by Google in the ads served on the websites of its partners, such as websites displaying AdSense ads or participating in Google certified ad networks. When users visit a partner’s website and either view or click on an ad, a cookie may be dropped on that end user’s browser.

You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting <http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx>

You can review Google’s privacy policy regarding advertising [here](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/) and its partner sites [here](https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/partner-sites/).
