# WRAL OnLine - Visitor Privacy Statement

## Automatic Data Collection

When a visitor requests a page of information from a web site, information about the request is automatically stored in a log file. This information includes the address of the computer making the request (the Internet address, not the street address), the time and date of the request, the type of web browser being used, and sometimes, the page from which the visitor is coming. The information does **not** contain the visitor's name or e-mail address, since the visitor's browser does not provide this information to the web server. 

WRAL OnLine analyzes these log files to learn about how visitors are using the content on the site. This information is used to to allocate resources effectively and improve the content of our site. 

## Voluntary Registration

Certain parts of WRAL OnLine require that visitors register by providing their names, e-mail addresses, and other personal information, which is recorded in databases on our servers. 

This information is kept strictly confidential; it is not shared with or sold to other companies unless specifically noted on the registration form. Data supplied to WRAL may, however, be used internally to assist us in learning more about our audience and their preferences. The data may be used to send e-mail announcements of events on the site to users who registered for similar events. The data may also be used for direct mailings to WRAL viewers. 

If you do not want to receive such mail, when you register for one of our sections, you may opt to not be included in mailings. If a particular registration form does not have this option, you can send mail to [webmaster@wral-tv.com](mailto:webmaster@wral-tv.com). Please include your name and the section for which you were registering so that we can effectively remove you from the database. 

## Cookies

A cookie is simply a small piece of information that a web server asks your browser to store on your local computer, and then later your browser presents this information to the web server. In its simplest form, a cookie is just an identifying number. 

Some sites have sophisticated databases which link the cookie numbers to personal information so that they could monitor exactly what a particular visitor does on the web site. It is important to note that this personal information would have to be voluntarily provided to the web site by the visitor (by filling out an online form). 

WRAL OnLine uses cookies for anonymous visitor tracking. WRAL OnLine's web server assigns each visitor a unique numerical ID. All requests for pages are tagged with that ID, and by analyzing log files, we can determine how many unique visitors used the site. 

We do not know the identity of a person based on the numerical ID. The cookies used on WRAL OnLine do not contain any personal information about visitors, nor are they used to look up personal information about visitors. Even if you have entered information about yourself in one of our registration forms, we do not relate that information to the cookie data. 

The advertisements displayed on our site may also make use of cookies. When used by an ad rotation system, cookies help insure that when a visitor clicks through on a randomly displayed advertisement, the visitor is taken to the appropriate page. Most of the ads on the site come from advertising bureaus which serve ads for a large number of web sites. The advertising bureaus may have picked up personal information about visitors (again, only if the visitor voluntarily provides it) from other sites using the advertising bureaus. The advertising bureau may use the cookie and any related information for a variety of purposes, including targeting ads by demographics or direct marketing. 

WRAL OnLine does not share any personal information provided by our visitors with our advertising bureaus. 

## E-Commerce and Security in the WRAL iShop

WRAL OnLine has partnered with Shop The Country in Atlanta, Ga., to provide complete e-commerce services, including customer service, secure online ordering, credit card processing and order fulfillment. 

We know that security is important to you, and as a result, Shop The Country made safeguarding your information its top priority. ShopTheCountry.com is fully equipped with a secure server for all online transactions. All transactions and credit card information are encrypted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) Protocol. This ensures that your credit card information is encrypted throughout the entire process. Therefore, this system is very secure, and you need not be concerned about someone accessing your credit card (or any other) information. 

In order to protect our customers, we verify all orders placed over $500. We will contact you after your order is placed for verification before we process your order and charge your credit card.

WRAL OnLine works with a third party that serves ads to this site. To find out more about how Engage manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on this site, please go to <http://www.engage.com/privacy/privacy.htm>.
