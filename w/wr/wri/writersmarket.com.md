##  Information We Collect

###  Information about your computer hardware and software

For each visitor to our web site, our web server automatically recognizes your IP address. The address allows our server to deliver the information you request from us, such as an article or a form for posting to a discussion board. We also collect visitors' IP addresses in their domain-name form, allowing us to understand for instance how many customers access our site through various service providers. We collect this information on an individual basis and in aggregate, or combined, form.

We also collect both user-specific and aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit. We use the information to improve the content of our web pages, to customize the content and layout of our pages, and to notify consumers about updates to our site.

We use cookies to store visitors' preferences, record session information such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to our site, record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site, ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, and to customize Web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends. (We use both session cookies and persistent cookies.)

###  Email address, postal address, telephone number

If at any time you provide us with your email address to place an order or access a service, we collect that information. Areas we may collect your email address include but are not limited to discussion boards; chat areas; product or service transactions; emails you send us; and interactive forms. If you supply us with your postal address online, you may receive periodic mailings from us and carefully selected partners with information on new products and services.

Customers who supply us with their telephone numbers online may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding new products and services or upcoming events. We do not rent telephone contact information to third parties.

Finally, we keep any information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations, both in aggregate and personally identifiable ways.

If you do not wish to receive emails from us, please let us know by using the response device that can be found at the bottom of every email we deliver.
