# Privacy policy | Emphasis

**Privacy policy**

If you have any questions about this privacy policy please contact us at [info@writing-skills.com](mailto:info@writing-skills.com) and we will be happy to help.

**Information collected**

We collect personal information from visitors to www.writing-skills.com (‘the Site’) through the use of online forms and every time you email us your details. We also collect information about the transactions you undertake including details of payment cards used. We collect additional information automatically about your visit to our website (see Cookie policy, below).

Any personal information you provide via the Site may be used for the purposes outlined below. We may disclose this information to other companies in the Emphasis group and their subcontractors in connection with these purposes, but it will not be processed for other purposes or disclosed to other third parties without your express permission.

**Use of personal information**

We process personal information collected via the Site for the purposes of:

  * providing and personalising our services
  * dealing with your enquiries and requests
  * providing reservation or booking services
  * maintaining information as a reference tool or general resource
  * carrying out market research campaigns
  * providing you with information about products and services we offer.



We may also use and disclose information in aggregate (so that no individuals are identified) for marketing and strategic development purposes.

**Other websites**

The Site may contain links to other websites which are outside our control and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you access other sites using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from ours.

**Internet-based transfers**

Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process personal data necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Therefore, by browsing this website and communicating electronically with us, you acknowledge and agree to our processing of personal data in this way.

**Cookie policy**

We use cookies to help us:  
•    make our website work as you’d expect  
•    remember your settings during and between visits  
•    improve the speed/security of the site  
•    allow you to share pages with social networks like Facebook  
•    continually improve our website for you  
•    make our marketing more efficient (which ultimately keeps down the costs to you).

We do not use cookies to:  
•    collect personally identifiable or sensitive information without your express permission  
•    pass data to advertising networks  
•    pass personally identifiable data to third parties  
•    pay sales commissions.

You can learn more about all the cookies we use below.

**Granting us permission to use cookies**

If your browser is set to allow cookies, we take this as your implicit consent to receive cookies from our site. Should you wish to remove or not use cookies from our site, you can learn how to do this below. But this may mean that our site will not work as you would expect.

**Website function cookies**

**Our own cookies**

We use cookies to make our website work including:  
•    remembering your search settings  
•    allowing you to add comments to our site.

Unfortunately there is no way to prevent these cookies being set if you use our site.

**Third party functions**

Our site, like most websites, includes functionality provided by third parties (eg YouTube). We’ve listed these below. Disabling cookies will probably break the functions offered by third parties:

  * YouTube
  * Wistia



These cookies help power the video on our site.

**Social website cookies**

We have included buttons on our site so you can easily ‘Like’ or share our content on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. The plugin we use requires cookies to function.

The privacy implications of this will vary from social network to social network and will depend on the privacy settings you have chosen on those networks.

**Anonymous visitor statistics cookies**

Analytics programs use cookies to compile website statistics. Unless you explicitly give us your information by filling in a form or calling us, all data that analytics programs collects is stored in an anonymous, aggregate form.

Examples include:  
•    how visitors reached our website (eg from an advert, from social networks, from Google etc)  
•    the site usage of visitors to our website (such as the number of pages viewed, time spend on individual pages, the pages visitors leave our site on)  
•    how often visitors return to our site  
•    visitor technology (eg browser, operating system, device etc).

These statistics help us make our site as user-friendly as possible, to ensure a good experience for all visitors.

We use:

Google Analytics – a program that helps us measure site usage.

ResponseTap – a phone-call tracking system that allows us to see the website usage of people who call us. This includes where callers come from, how they arrived at our website, and which pages they viewed. ResponseTap is responsible for the automatically generated phone number on our pages and in our header banner. If you want to avoid giving us this information, simply call us using 01273 732 888 instead. That way no website usage information will be linked to your phone call.

Infusionsoft – a program that keeps track of the people we send email marketing to. If you give us your email address using a web form, your activity on this site will be associated with your email in our Infusionsoft database.
