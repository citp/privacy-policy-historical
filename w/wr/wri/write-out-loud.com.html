Cookies are identifiers that are transferred to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize the sites pages, or register with any of our site's services, a cookie enables <i>write-out-loud.com</i> to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.</p> <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying your Web browser; however, if you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the site.</p> <p>A web beacon is a transparent image file used to monitor your journey around a single website or collection of sites.
