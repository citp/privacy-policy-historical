  <p>WritersWeekly.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate 
    our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering 
    and dissemination practices for this website: WritersWeekly.com.<br>
    <br>
    You may visit WritersWeekly.com without identifying yourself, but if you'd 
    like to make a purchase you will need to register. Any information you provide 
    during the registration process, and the purchases you make, are considered 
    part of your WritersWeekly.com account. We use this information to fill your 
    orders, provide customer service assistance, and improve the content of our 
    site so that we may better serve you. <br>
    <br>
    WritersWeekly.com believes that your personal information - including your 
    purchases, email and residential addresses, and credit card information - 
    belongs to you. We collect this information when you provide it, but we do 
    not rent or sell information concerning our customers to third parties. <br>
    <br>
    We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer 
    our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping 
    cart. <br>
    <br>
    Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart. <br>
    <br>
    Our site uses javascript and image tags to track site traffic.<br>
    <br>
    Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information 
    (like their name and email address) We use customer contact information from 
    the registration form to send the user information about our company and promotional 
    material from some of our partners. The customer's contact information is 
    also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving 
    future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. <br>
    <br>
    This site contains links to other sites. <b>WritersWeekly.com</b> is not responsible 
    for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. <br>
    <br>
    Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, 
    and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email address) 
    and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). Contact 
    information from the order form is used to send orders to our customers. The 
    customer's contact information is used to get in touch with the visitor when 
    necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out 
    section below. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the 
    user for products and services. <br>
    <br>
    We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information 
    (like their email address). We use contact data from our contests to send 
    users information about our company. The customer's contact information is 
    also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving 
    future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.<br>
    <br>
    This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration 
    of the information under our control.<br>
    <br>
    Ensuring secure online ordering is an important part of our pledge to honor 
    your privacy. WritersWeekly.com utilizes SSL (secure socket layers) to protect 
    your credit card information. SSL encrypts all ordering information, such 
    as your name and credit card number, so that it cannot be read in transit. 
    When you place an order with us, your credit card information is captured 
    and stored separately from your order. It cannot be read by anyone other than 
    our staff. Only customers using browsers that support SSL can complete their 
    order online using secure transactions. <br>
  </p>
  <p>If you don't have a browser that supports SSL or if you feel uncomfortable 
    sending your credit card information via the web, we offer you the option 
    of faxing us to complete your order. Once you've selected the items you want 
    to order you will have the option to proceed with your order online or to 
    fax us with your credit card number or a copy of your check.<br>
    <br>
    If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this 
    site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can contact:</p>
