## 1\. Personal Information

The following personal information is collected: Name, email, phone, job title, school name, address, etc.

When you register to use our service, we request your personal information for these purposes:

  1. To verify your identity and determine your status to register in connection with your specific academic institution.
  2. To obtain your contact information so we can correctly administer your account.
  3. To inform you of changes in the functionality, auxiliary services, and promotions of the Turnitin service.

  2. To request your evaluation and recommendations for the Turnitin service.



PAPER SUBMISSION

When anyone requests access to our paper submission web pages, we request personal information for these purposes:

  1. To identify the individual connected to any uploaded text.
  2. To provide receipt and confirmation of successful text uploads.



The type of information we request is connected to a specific purpose. For example, we collect personal contact information such as name, physical address, telephone number, and email address for a registered user in order to facilitate use of the Turnitin service and facilitate customer relations. In addition to the specific uses noted above, Turnitin also uses your personally identifiable information to process your requests and transactions.

Turnitin may also use your personally identifiable information to prevent harm or injury, to prevent fraud, to protect our legal interests, to comply with or respond to legal process, and to comply with applicable laws.

Access to personal information by third parties will only occur via signed or electronic consent by registered users as stated in our registration agreement. This approval includes, but is not limited to, one registered user allowing Turnitin to provide his or her contact information to another registered user for document source analysis tracking. For example, if material uploaded to our database matches material from a later upload, contact information related to the former is given to the registered user associated with the latter upload for follow-up if the former specifically consents. As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets, or Turnitin might be acquired by another company. In any of these circumstances, personal information in our databases may be included among the transferred assets. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information. You may opt out of marketing communications [here.](http://go.turnitin.com/preferences)

This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you and to improve site functionality.
