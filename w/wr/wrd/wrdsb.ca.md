**Privacy Policy Statement**

This Privacy Policy applies to our online practices only. 

The following policy applies to the **wrdsb.on.ca** site. 

The WRDSB is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its online visitors. This policy statement provides our visitors (e.g., parents, teachers, and students) with an overview of the measures we have taken to provide a safe environment for everyone. 

**Use of IP Addresses**  
We collect IP addresses to obtain aggregate information on the use of **wrdsb.on.ca**. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by a Web server when you're on the Web. When you are on our site, we have a back-end server that logs your computer's IP address. We only use the information we find out from tracking IP addresses in the aggregate, such as how many users entered a specific area of our site, and not to track a specific IP address to identify an individual user. However, we may use such information to identify a user if we feel that there are or may be safety and/or security issues or to comply with legal requirements. 

**Security**  
WRDSB ensures that all personally and non-personally identifiable information that it receives via the internet is secure against unauthorized access. This information is kept in a safe and secure system isolated from direct connection to the internet. This means that no eyes but ours will ever see the information that our visitors send to us, unless we indicate otherwise. 

**Why are we so safe?**  
**wrdsb.on.ca** uses secure server software over a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) line to protect your credit card information. It encrypts all of your personal and credit card information so that this information cannot be read as it travels to our ordering system, and once it is received, it is stored in a location not accessible via the Internet. 

**Links to other sites**  
Visitors will find links from **wrdsb.on.ca** to independently owned, controlled and/or managed World Wide Web or Internet sites whose content we have found or possible interest to our visitors. In many cases, but not always, the links represent cooperative projects or mutual links established with the organizations connected with these sites. While we initially visit these sites to which we directly link, please note that we do not monitor or control the content that appears on these sites and such content may be constantly changing. We recommend that children check with their parents or teachers before clicking off to any new sites, and we encourage all end users of **wrdsb.on.ca** to read the privacy policies of all linked sites before navigating through them. 

Please note that we may revise our policy as the content on our sites continues to change. 

We hope that you enjoy exploring our sites. 

**wrdsb.on.ca** is owned and operated by the Waterloo Region District School Board., 51 Ardelt Ave Kitchener Ontario N2C 2R5. We can be reached by phone at 1-519-570-0003. If you have any questions about our privacy policy or practices, or you wish to amend, update, or verify information on file, or to notify us that you want your information deleted from our files, contact us at this address.
