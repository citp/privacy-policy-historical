# Wisconsin Public Radio's Privacy Policy

Protecting the privacy of our Web site visitors is very important us!. Because we gather certain types of information about our visitors, we want to make sure you are informed of the ways in which we may and may not use the information you transmit to us when you visit us. This statement discloses the privacy practices for all WPR Web sites including the [Wisconsin Public Radio Association](http://wpra.org/) member support site. 

Voluntarily-Supplied Information

We will not collect personally identifiable information from you, other than what you supply to us on a voluntary basis. To make use of certain features on our web sites, you may need to register and provide some information as part of the registration process. The information you supply helps us offer you more personalized features, tailoring our site to your interests and making it more useful to you. 

In order to participate in some activities, you may be asked to provide some personally identifiable information so we can continually improve the services we offer. For example, we need to know your e-mail address to send you electronic newsletters and for you to participate online in various activities. Knowing some of your program preferences can help us send information tailored to your interests. Supplying such information is entirely voluntary. 

The areas of the site in which we collect such information, the information collected and the purpose for collecting that information are described below: 

Online Pledges and Purchases

WPR's Web site offers you the convenience of making membership contributions and other purchases via credit card. We take seriously the security of your account information. As with credit card transactions made over the phone or in person, your credit card information is used only for the purchase or contribution you wish to make.

When making an online pledge, you must provide your name, mailing address, home telephone number, contribution level and credit card or other payment information. This is the same information we ask of all contributors in order to process pledges. In addition, Online contributors must also supply their e-mail addresses. You also have the option of supplying a telephone number.

You can purchase various items through our Web sites. When making an online purchase, you must provide your name, mailing address, home telephone number, e-mail address and credit card payment information. This information is also handled through our secure server and is required to process and ship orders. This information will not be disclosed to any third party.

Our Web transaction forms are stored and served from a secure server. This means that all information flowing between your computer and our server is encrypted, so in the highly unlikely event that your transmission is intercepted, it will not be usable. The web address of these forms will start with "https" and most browsers will show that the session is encrypted with an icon next to the address or elsewhere on the screen.  
For example: 

Volunteer opportunities

If you would like to volunteer your time to support WPR, you can do so through an online form on our Web site. In order to register as a volunteer, you must provide your name, mailing address, daytime and evening telephone numbers and your e-mail address. This information makes it possible for us to notify you of volunteer opportunities. Other details you provide in the online form help us match your interests with our needs. 

Subscription to Electronic Newsletters

WPR offers free electronic newsletters to users. These newsletters include highlights of WPR programming, daily program schedules and other information of interest to our listeners and supporters. To subscribe, you must provide your e-mail address. To remove yourself from the mailing list, follow the instructions at the bottom of any newsletter. 

Feedback, Requests and Suggestions

WPR uses several e-mail forms throughout its Web sites such as on our "Listener Feedback" page, our "Comments & Suggestions" page, and on our "Classics by Request" page. In most cases, we request your name, e-mail address and other information such as your comments, suggestions or musical requests. In addition, some forms give you the option of entering a city and state. This information is used to respond to your comments and it may be used in aggregate form for statistical purposes. 

Surveys

WPR may occasionally conduct a survey with the option of participating through wpr.org. Apart from program preference information you provide, survey responses are not correlated to any personally identifying information and are used in aggregate form to help us tailor WPR's broadcast and online services to your needs.
