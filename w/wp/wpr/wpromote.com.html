				<h2>WPROMOTE, INC. Privacy Policy for www.wpromote.com</h2>
			</div>
			
			<p><i>Updated Date: January 1, 2014</i></p>
			
			<p>
				WPROMOTE, Inc. ("WPROMOTE" or "www.wpromote.com" or "we" or "us") has created this privacy policy (this "Privacy Policy") in order to demonstrate its commitment to user, visitor and customer privacy with regard to the WPROMOTE web site at www.wpromote.com (the "Website"). Privacy on the Website is of great importance to us. Because we gather important information from our users, visitors and customers (collectively "Customers" or "you" or "your"), we have established this Privacy Policy as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. By accessing this Website, you acknowledge and agree to this Privacy Policy and also agree to the Terms of Use of the Website.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
			<p>
				We require Customers who register to use the services offered on our Website (collectively, the "Service") to give us contact information, which may include but is not limited to the Customer’s name, company name, address, phone number, email address, credit card number, cookies, IP logs, and other information (collectively "Personal Information"). Besides the Personal Information, we may also collect other information regarding your use of the Website. From time to time, we may also collect or ask for additional Personal Information, which will also be expressly included herein as Personal Information. You can opt out of providing this additional information by not entering it when asked or not using the Website, although not providing it may hinder your ability to use the Website.
			</p>
			<p>
				We use the information that we collect to provide and maintain the Website as we deem appropriate in our sole discretion. We may also use the information to contact you to further discuss interest in our company, the services that we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions and events. You may be invited to receive an email newsletter or other correspondence by providing an email address. Your email address and any Personal Information will not be distributed or shared with third parties unless it is to transact such business as you have contracted us to do, to comply with any legal processes and/or law enforcement requests, or in order to conduct any business as we, in our sole subjective discretion, deem reasonable. We may also email (or send via other methods) information regarding updates to the Website or WPROMOTE, and may send a customer newsletter, or other correspondence. You will have an opportunity to unsubscribe to any emails or mailings by clicking on an "unsubscribe" hyperlink contained in promotional emails we send you, or by e-mailing us at our Customer Service Department. Any opt-out by you is not deemed valid until processed by WPROMOTE. It is your obligation to verify that you have been opted-out. WPROMOTE shall not be liable for problems with the opt-out procedures.
			</p>
			<p>
				Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, or as provided for herein or in the WPROMOTE Terms of Use Agreement, we do not disclose to third parties the information provided. All financial and billing information that we collect through the Website is used solely to check the qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for the Service. This billing information is not used by WPROMOTE for marketing or promotional purposes, except as provided for herein. We may use a third-party intermediary to manage the credit card processing and we may share any appropriate information with them.
			</p>
			<p>
				You may be using the Website to host data (including but not limited to pictures, email correspondence with other users and other content) and information ("Data"). We will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such Data except as provided herein and in the WPROMOTE Terms of Use, as may be required by law, or in order to conduct any business that we, in our sole subjective discretion, deem reasonable.

Of course, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your user registration and password.
			</p>
