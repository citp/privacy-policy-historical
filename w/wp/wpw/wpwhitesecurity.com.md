This notice regards our relationship with you as a website visitor and/or as a customer.

## What information we collect

### Customer service and contact forms

If you contact us with a customer service concern, we’ll do our best to help. This may involve us asking you for technical information about your website. Any information you give to us in the context of a support query will only be used by our internal team for as long as it takes to resolve your concern. We will log your support experience in our internal customer service system in case we need to follow up.

We don’t use any third parties for customer service, and we won’t pass your details to any.

If you fill in a contact form, the form will collect your name, email address and the other information you provide in the form. We only use this data to reply to you. We retain this data  for as long as it is necessary to respond to your message.

### Email lists and promotional messaging

While we’d love to keep you in the loop about our latest plugins and news, you will not receive any promotional messages from us unless you opt in to allow us to send them.

If you have opted in but are no longer interested in our promotional messages from us, you can unsubscribe by using the unsubscribe links in all our emails.

### Comments

When visitors leave comments on articles or posts, the site collects the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection. An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it.[ The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here](https://automattic.com/privacy). After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

Outside of Google Analytics, this site does not use any other third party cookies.

We may occasionally embed useful content such as videos from [YouTube](https://policies.google.com/privacy), [tweets](https://twitter.com/en/privacy), etc. Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website. These services may collect your IP Address, your browser’s User Agent, store and retrieve cookies on your browser, embed additional third party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including correlating your interaction with the content with your account with that service, if you are logged in to that service.
