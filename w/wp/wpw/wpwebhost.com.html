Some of the methods WPWebHost uses to collect data are automated and will take effect automatically as you navigate the Website and/or use the Software.
What information does WPWebHost collect?
Personal Information.
Personal information means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person (“Personal Information”).

Server Information.
If you use one of WPWebHost’ services such as WPWebHost ‘ Web Hosting, Dedicated Server, VPS, Domain Name or SSL, WPWebHost may collect certain information concerning such services and concerning the server upon which the services operates. This information includes without limitation: (a) the licensed or unlicensed status of the software used under the services; (b) the source from which the license for the software was obtained (i.e., WPWebHost or an WPWebHost affiliate); or (c) information about the server upon which the software is installed including (i) the public IP address, (ii) the operating system and (iii) the use of any virtualization technologies on such server ((a) through (c) collectively, “Server Information”)).

Non-Personal Information.
WPWebHost also collects data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. WPWebHost may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.
What information does WPWebHost collect if you’re under the age of 13?
By Default, WPWebHost does not knowingly collect Personal Information about children under the age of 13. If WPWebHost becomes aware that it has inadvertently collected Personal Information about children under the age of 13, it will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible, except where WPWebHost is required by applicable law to keep it.
Where WPWebHost knows a child is above the age of 13, but considered a minor under applicable law, WPWebHost will obtain parental/guardian consent prior to using that child’s Personal Information.
How does WPWebHost use and store the information it collects?
As a general matter, WPWebHost may use the Personal Information you disclose to WPWebHost to improve and provide the Website, the Services and WPWebHost’ other products and services, and for the specific purpose that you gave WPWebHost your Personal Information. More specific details on how WPWebHost uses your information follows below.
WPWebHost may use Personal Information to create and authenticate your account, to process transactions you request such as domain name registration in order to perform any contract you have entered into with WPWebHost, to provide you with customer and technical support and to communicate with you about your account and WPWebHost’ products and services.
The Personal Information you provide to WPWebHost allows WPWebHost to provide you with the newsletters and mailing lists that you have signed up for with WPWebHost. If you do not want to be on WPWebHost’ mailing list, you can opt out at any time by changing your settings in your ‘My Details’ page within the client area.
WPWebHost may also use Personal Information to offer, market or advertise to you WPWebHost products and services. While such WPWebHost products and services may reference, incorporate or include third-party products and services, WPWebHost will not use your Personal Information to independently offer, market or advertise third-party products and services unless WPWebHost first obtains your consent to do so.
From time to time, WPWebHost may use your Personal Information to send important notices, such as important product updates and communications about purchases as well as changes to WPWebHost’ terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important for your interaction with WPWebHost you may not opt out of receiving these communications.
WPWebHost may also use your Personal Information for any other legal purpose stated in this Privacy Policy, and any other purpose for which you have given WPWebHost express consent.
Where you consent to WPWebHost doing so, WPWebHost may use your Personal Information to send you direct marketing communications. Should you ever choose to ‘opt out’ of receiving such communications, WPWebHost may retain your Personal Information on file to ensure that WPWebHost does not continue to target you with communications of the type that you have asked WPWebHost to cease sending to you.
WPWebHost limits the use of Personal Information to the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy and for which you have provided explicit consent. In accordance with established policies and procedures, WPWebHost retains Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfil the stated purposes, unless it is required by law for a different period or WPWebHost has the consent of the individual.
In accordance with established policies and procedures, WPWebHost will periodically destroy or erase any Personal Information that is no longer needed.
WPWebHost may use User Communications in the same way as WPWebHost uses Personal Information. If you communicate with WPWebHost for a particular purpose, WPWebHost may use your User Communications for that purpose. For example, if you contact WPWebHost for technical support, WPWebHost may use your communications to provide technical support to you.
WPWebHost may use Server Information to provide you with technical support services and to maintain, evaluate, improve and provide WPWebHost products and services. WPWebHost may also use such information to investigate unlicensed (and therefore unauthorised) uses of WPWebHost’ software.

To protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of information that is collected from customers, WPWebHost has appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in place.
How can I modify my personal information?
You may modify your personal information by logging a Help Desk ticket to make the request or update from the WPWebHost Client Billing System.
If you have registered a domain name with WPWebHost and wish to change the Technical Contact from WPWebHost to another company or change any other registration information, you should be able to do so by logging into the respective Domain Registrar Control Panel. WPWebHost provides you with full access to your domain account by sending you your own username and password. It is important to note that your domain name registration information is made publicly available in the registry of domain names. In the event you lose your domain password, you can log a Help Desk ticket and we will re-send the password to the email address on the domain registration record. In the event you lose your password and the email address on record with Domain Registrar is no longer valid, a direct request to Domain Registrar is required, therefore it is important to keep your Domain Registrar email address current as well as your email address with WPWebHost.
Will WPWebHost Ever Send Me Direct Mailings?
From time to time, WPWebHost may send you information about various products and services that may be of interest. We will not send you information of this type without specifically allowing you to “opt out” of such mailings.

You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose Personal Information to other users or to third parties on the WPWebHost system, through e-mail, or outside of the WPWebHost system, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other members or third parties.
