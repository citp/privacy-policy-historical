By Default, WPWebHost does not knowingly collect Personal Information about children under the age of 13. If WPWebHost becomes aware that it has inadvertently collected Personal Information about children under the age of 13, it will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible, except where WPWebHost is required by applicable law to keep it.

Where WPWebHost knows a child is above the age of 13, but considered a minor under applicable law, WPWebHost will obtain parental/guardian consent prior to using that child’s Personal Information.

As a general matter, WPWebHost may use the Personal Information you disclose to WPWebHost to improve and provide the Website, the Services and WPWebHost’ other products and services, and for the specific purpose that you gave WPWebHost your Personal Information. More specific details on how WPWebHost uses your information follows below.

WPWebHost may use Personal Information to create and authenticate your account, to process transactions you request such as domain name registration in order to perform any contract you have entered into with WPWebHost, to provide you with customer and technical support and to communicate with you about your account and WPWebHost’ products and services.

The Personal Information you provide to WPWebHost allows WPWebHost to provide you with the newsletters and mailing lists that you have signed up for with WPWebHost. If you do not want to be on WPWebHost’ mailing list, you can opt out at any time by changing your settings in your ‘My Details’ page within the client area.

WPWebHost may also use Personal Information to offer, market or advertise to you WPWebHost products and services. While such WPWebHost products and services may reference, incorporate or include third-party products and services, WPWebHost will not use your Personal Information to independently offer, market or advertise third-party products and services unless WPWebHost first obtains your consent to do so.

From time to time, WPWebHost may use your Personal Information to send important notices, such as important product updates and communications about purchases as well as changes to WPWebHost’ terms, conditions, and policies.

Where you consent to WPWebHost doing so, WPWebHost may use your Personal Information to send you direct marketing communications. Should you ever choose to ‘opt out’ of receiving such communications, WPWebHost may retain your Personal Information on file to ensure that WPWebHost does not continue to target you with communications of the type that you have asked WPWebHost to cease sending to you.

WPWebHost limits the use of Personal Information to the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy and for which you have provided explicit consent. In accordance with established policies and procedures, WPWebHost retains Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfil the stated purposes, unless it is required by law for a different period or WPWebHost has the consent of the individual.

In accordance with established policies and procedures, WPWebHost will periodically destroy or erase any Personal Information that is no longer needed.

WPWebHost may use User Communications in the same way as WPWebHost uses Personal Information. If you communicate with WPWebHost for a particular purpose, WPWebHost may use your User Communications for that purpose. For example, if you contact WPWebHost for technical support, WPWebHost may use your communications to provide technical support to you.

WPWebHost may use Server Information to provide you with technical support services and to maintain, evaluate, improve and provide WPWebHost products and services. WPWebHost may also use such information to investigate unlicensed (and therefore unauthorised) uses of WPWebHost’ software.

If you have registered a domain name with WPWebHost and wish to change the Technical Contact from WPWebHost to another company or change any other registration information, you should be able to do so by logging into the respective Domain Registrar Control Panel. WPWebHost provides you with full access to your domain account by sending you your own username and password. It is important to note that your domain name registration information is made publicly available in the registry of domain names. In the event you lose your domain password, you can log a Help Desk ticket and we will re-send the password to the email address on the domain registration record. In the event you lose your password and the email address on record with Domain Registrar is no longer valid, a direct request to Domain Registrar is required, therefore it is important to keep your Domain Registrar email address current as well as your email address with WPWebHost.

From time to time, WPWebHost may send you information about various products and services that may be of interest. We will not send you information of this type without specifically allowing you to “opt out” of such mailings.
