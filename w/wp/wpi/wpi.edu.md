# WPI's Privacy Statement

Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of visitors to our website. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website (www.wpi.edu).

**Collection & Use of Personal Information**  
Many of the forms on our site require visitors to give us contact information (like their name and email address), unique identifiers (like their social security number), and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use information from registration forms to send each visitor information about our University. This information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary.

Registered users of our [Admissions Café](http://www.wpi.edu/cgi-bin/ubb/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro), may receive email messages from time to time from our Admissions staff - users can choose to opt out of these mailings by going into the Café and editing their profile to be left off the mailing list. Unique identifiers (such as social security numbers) are collected only to verify the user's identity internally.

Demographic and profile data is also collected through some of our web forms. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content in which we think they might be interested, and displaying the content according to their preferences.

**IP Logging**  
When a visitor sends us email via our [Feedback Form](http://www.wpi.edu/cgi-bin/feedback), we collect that person's _IP address_ (the unique identifier of a computer on the Internet) and use it to help us diagnose problems with our server. In fact, a majority of our webforms collect and pass along the sender's IP address to the recipient of the email generated by the form.

**Cookies**  
In some areas of our website, including, but not limited to the [Admissions Café](http://www.wpi.edu/cgi-bin/ubb/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro), we use cookies to save a visitor's password so it doesn't have to be re-entered each time that person visits our site.

**Confidentiality**  
All of the data collected via our web forms is confidential and internal to employees of the University. **At no time will WPI sell or otherwise distribute to parties external to WPI the contact information or demographic data collected via its website.**

**Reporting Violations of this Privacy Statement**  
This site contains links to other sites, including the personal websites of WPI faculty, staff, and students. WPI is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. Visitors who observe personal sites on the WPI server which violate copyright laws and/or the [WPI Acceptable Use Policy](https://web.archive.org/+AUP) should immediately report such activity to [webmaster@wpi.edu](mailto:webmaster@wpi.edu).

**Public Forums**  
This site makes use of discussion forums, such as the [Admissions Café](http://www.wpi.edu/cgi-bin/ubb/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro), the contents of which are accessible to users of the Internet. **Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information** and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

**Security**  
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Certain portions of the WPI website are restricted by domain to members of the WPI community only. Still other pages may require users to enter their username and password. These pages are intended for internal use only, and generally require the CCC UNIX username and password offered to all faculty, staff and students. Information on these pages is available to members of the WPI community [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20000610085032id_/http%3A//www.wpi.edu/Web/safe.html).

**Choice/Opt-Out**
