<div class="entry-content"><div>
<p>The WPProBusiness.com Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in  understanding how we collect and use the personal information you  provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using  our site and our products and services.</p>
<h4>What Information Do We Collect?</h4>
<p>When you visit our website you may provide us with two types of  information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that  is collected on an individual basis and website use information  collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse the site.</p>
<h4>1. Personal Information You Choose to Provide</h4>
<p><strong>Registration Information</strong><br>
You will provide us information about yourself, your firm or company, or your services when you contact WP Pro Business for products and services or register for our email newsletters.</p>
<p><strong>Email Information</strong><br>
If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the  content of your email messages together with your email address and our  responses.</p>
<h4>2. Website Use Information</h4>
<p>Similar to other commercial websites, this site utilizes a standard  technology called “cookies” (see explanation below, “What Are Cookies?”)  and Web server logs to collect information about how this site is used.  Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include  the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at this site,  and the websites visited just before and just after our site.  We, our  advertisers and ad serving companies may also use small technology or  pieces of code to determine which advertisements and promotions users  have seen and how users responded to them.</p>
<h4>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</h4>
<p>Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of  administering and expanding our business activities, providing customer  service and making available other products and services to our  customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the  information we collect to notify you about important changes to this  website, new services and special offers we think you will find  valuable. You may notify us of your desire not to receive these offers  by clicking the unsubscribe link contained in each such email.</p>
<h4>What Are Cookies?</h4>
<p>A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an  anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site’s  computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part  of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each website can  send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow  it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website  to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent  to you by other sites.  Some of our business partners (e.g.,  advertisers) use cookies that originate from their sites. We have no  access or control over those cookies.</p>
<h4>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</h4>
<p>As you use this website, the site uses its cookies to differentiate  you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you  from seeing unnecessary advertisements or requiring you to log in more  than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our web  server’s log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people  visiting this site and which parts of the site are most popular. This  helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve this site and  better serve our customers. Cookies do not allow us to gather any  personal information about you and we do not generally store any  personal information that you provided to us in your cookies.</p>
<h4>Sharing Information with Third Parties</h4>
<p>The information we collect is used to improve the content of this  site and the quality of our service, and is not shared with or sold to  other organizations for commercial purposes. That being said, your  information could be shared under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>We use third parties to facilitate our business, including, but not  limited to, sending email and processing payments. In connection with  these offerings and business operations, these third parties may have  access to your personal information for use in connection with those  business activities.</li>
<li>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business  offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of  the transferred business assets in these types of transactions.</li>
<li>We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or any dissolution.</li>
<li>If it becomes necessary to share information in order to  investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,  suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical  safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as  otherwise required by law.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Notice of New Services and Changes</h4>
<p>Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify  you about important changes to this website, new services, and special  offers we think you will find valuable. As our customer, you will be  given the opportunity to notify us of your desire not to receive these  offers by clicking the unsubscribe link contained in each such email.</p>
<h4>How Do We Secure Information Transmissions?</h4>
<p>Email is not recognized as a secure medium of communication. For this  reason, we request that you do not send private information to us by  email. Some of the information you may enter on this site may be  transmitted securely via Secure Sockets Layer SSL, 128 bit encryption  services. Pages utilizing this technology will have URLs that start with  HTTPS instead of HTTP.</p>
<h4>Certain Disclosures</h4>
<p>We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law  or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a)  conform to the law or comply with legal process served on us or  affiliated parties; (b) protect and defend our rights and property, our  site, the users of our site, and/or our affiliated parties; (c) act  under circumstances to protect the safety of users of our site, us, or  third parties.</p>
<h4>What About Other Websites Linked to This Site?</h4>
<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked  to or from our site nor the information or content contained therein.  Often links to other websites are provided solely as pointers to  information on topics that may be useful to the users of our site.  Please remember that when you use a link to go from our site to another  website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and  interaction on any other website, including sites which have a link on  our site, is subject to that website’s own rules and policies. Please  read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p>
<h4>Your Consent</h4>
<p>By using this site you consent to our collection and use of your  personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we change  our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on this  site to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and  under what circumstances we may disclose it.</p>
