**Privacy Policy**

**What Personally Identifiable Information of Yours is Collected**

Rangefinder Publishing recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about visitors to the rangefindermag.com web site and the wppinow.com/wppionline.com site. (the "Sites"). As a general policy, no personally identifiable information, such as your name, address or email address, is automatically collected from visitors to these Sites. Personally identifiable information about visitors to these Sites is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted by you. However, we may automatically collect certain non-personal information to optimize our web pages for your computer (e.g., the identity of your Internet browser, the type of operating system you use, and the domain name of your Internet service provider).

**How the Information is Used**

Rangefinder Publishing uses the personal information you supply us to enhance our services, fulfill your requests, personalize your experience and provide you or permit others to provide you with special offers we think you will find valuable. We also use other information obtained from user site traffic patterns to better provide you with a personalized experience and special advertising offers and promotions.

Rangefinder Publishing uses your personal information to, among other things, send you advertising from third parties, including selected Rangefinder Publishing partners, provide you with advertising and other promotional offers that we believe will be of interest to you, and contact users for feedback regarding Rangefinder Publishing and Rangefinder Publishing's partners via email surveys.

Rangefinder Publishing may also be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to appropriate governmental authorities. If requested by law enforcement or judicial authorities, we will provide this information upon receipt of the appropriate documentation. Rangefinder Publishing may also provide information to law enforcement to protect its property and the health and safety of individuals as permitted by statute.

**With Whom the Information May Be Shared**

Rangefinder Publishing may make your personally identifiable information available to selected business partners of Rangefinder Publishing. In the event that all or substantially all of Rangefinder Publishing's stock and/or assets are transferred or sold to another entity, Rangefinder Publishing may transfer personally identifiable information to the acquiring entity. Also, Rangefinder may have a need to disclose your information to persons providing services for Rangefinder, such as ISPs.

Rangefinder Publishing may disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. Rangefinder Publishing may also disclose personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Use or to protect the safety of our users and the public or to certain third parties which assist us in developing, operating and maintaining the Rangefinder Publishing web site.

**Controlling the Use of Your Information**

If you do not wish to receive future offers or information from us, you may opt out of such communications by using the automated link on our website to remove yourself from our database. Please note that by using this automated link, you will typically be removed from our database within approximately 24 hours, though removal may require up to 10 business days.

If you would like to change or update your current data (e.g., your e-mail address) in our database, simply e-mail subscriptions@rfpublishing.com and we will take quick action.

**Links to Other Web Sites**

Rangefinder Publishing does not control the information collection and distribution policies on Internet domains other than those internet domains that are under the control of Rangefinder Publishing itself. When you are on the Site, you may be presented with links to other web sites that are beyond our control. These other sites may independently collect data, solicit personal information, or send their own cookies to you. Rangefinder Publishing is not responsible for any use of your information by such third party web sites.  
Use By Minors

This web site does not publish any content intended for the use of minors. Minors may not submit any personally identifiable information to this Site. If you are under 18 years of age, please do not submit any personal information to this Site.

**How is the Information Protected**

Rangefinder Publishing has measures in place to protect the security of personally identifiable information, including password and physical security measures, and limitation of access to such information to authorized individuals. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure, and no network can be guaranteed completely inaccessible to unauthorized individuals. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use this Site at your own risk.

**How This Privacy Policy May Change**

Rangefinder Publishing may add to, change or remove any part of this Privacy Policy at any time, without notice. Any changes to this Privacy Policy apply as soon as they are posted. By continuing to use this site after any changes are posted, you are indicating your acceptance of those changes.
