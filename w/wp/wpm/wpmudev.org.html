<h4>Your Rights</h4>



<p>If you are a registered user or have left comments on our site you can request to see or download the data we have about you.</p>



<p>Typically for visitors that have left comments, the data will be their email address, any IP addresses assigned to them at the time of leaving the comments and the user agent strings of the browsers they used. The rest of the data is public as published by the visitors.</p>



<p>For registered users or paying customers, this will also include profile information and download, payment, and support ticket histories.</p>



<p>You can also request “to be forgotten” and we will erase any personally identifiable data we have about you. Of course, this excludes data we need for administrative or security purposes or if we are required by law to retain some of the data.</p>



<p>An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, should direct his/her query to admin@incsub.com. We will respond within a reasonable timeframe, not to exceed one week.</p>



<h4>Protecting Your Data</h4>



<p>The security and reliability of our service is our number one priority. We invest heavily in the training of our staff and our infrastructure to ensure that best practices are followed in everything that we do.</p>



<p>See <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/security">wordpress.org/about/security</a> for details on the security of the WordPress core itself.</p>



<ul><li>Prevention is best when it comes to security, and as a first step, we follow all WordPress Code Standards in the plugins that we build and use.</li><li>In addition, we have an extensive internal review and Quality Assurance process in place specifically to prevent potential security vulnerabilities in our plugins and services.</li><li>Every Incsub employee and contractor goes through background checks and an onboarding process that includes a trial period where access to customer data is provided only when working directly under the supervision of another staff member.</li><li>All staff only have access to systems that are directly required to complete the functions of their job. We use dual factor authentication for all critical systems and communications services, and automatically log all staff activity using an internal logging tool, Google ‘G’ Suite features, and Amazon Cloud Trail.</li><li>All staff (including any contractors) undergo initial training to ensure proper understanding of all security-related processes. Staff regularly attend industry conferences and otherwise stay informed of best practices and relevant trends. Staff review and agree, in writing, to all policies and procedures annually.</li><li>We only use third-party services, such as Amazon Web Services, that are fully vetted and adhere to the highest levels of privacy and security practices.</li></ul>



<h4>Data Breach Procedures</h4>



<p>Should any event occur where customer data has been lost, stolen, or potentially compromised, our policy is to alert our customers via email no later than 48 hours of our team becoming aware of the event. We will also report such incident to any required data protection authority. We will work closely with any customers affected to determine next steps such as any end-user notifications, needed patches, and how to avoid any similar event in the future.</p>
