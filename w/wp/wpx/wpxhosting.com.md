### OK, but what do you DO with this information?

Because your personal information is so valuable to both you and us, we strongly believe in minimising the personal information we collect as well as limiting its use and purpose.

We will use this information as necessary to carry out our obligations, arising from any contracts between you and us, for which we have been given permission.

This information may also be used as required or permitted for legal compliance or other lawful purposes, as well as to provide you with the products and services you request from us and notify you about any changes in that regard.
