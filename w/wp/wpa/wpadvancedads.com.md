# Privacy Policy - Advanced Ads

This policy helps you to understand how we collect, share and use information about you. It applies to this website as well as to services and products connected with it (e.g., our _Advanced Ads_ plugins).

If you do not agree with this policy, do not access or use our services or interact with any other aspect of our business.

Our aim is to offer this information as complete and helpful as possible, so please [reach out](https://wpadvancedads.com/support/) in case something is missing or incomprehensible.

When we use “Advanced Ads”, “we” or “us” in this policy we refer to webgilde GmbH, the company behind and services offered by it.

## How and where we handle your information

We have access to information about you when you give it to us, use our services and products, and when other services provide it to us.

### Account and purchase information

For each purchase on wpadvancedads.com, an account is created automatically. It contains the information you gave us during the checkout and combines a history of your purchase and license activity (e.g., when you enable a license for one of our product). We are legally bound to store this information for 10 years. You can request the removal of your account information after 10 years of complete inactivity.

By purchasing you agree that we

  * Send you important account, order, service information, but not impersonal newsletters.
  * Respond to your queries, refund requests, or complaints.
  * Process payments to prevent fraudulent transactions and log downloads and license checks. We do this on the basis of our legitimate business interests.
  * Set up and administer your account, provide technical and/or customer support, and to verify your identity.



Additionally, we may also collect location and traffic data (including IP address) because we are legally obliged to charge you taxes based on this information and keep a record of it,

You can update your account information [here](https://wpadvancedads.com/account/edit-profile/).

We are using external services to process your payment. These services store the information you give them either on their sites or during the checkout. If you don‘t accept these services then please reach out to use and ask for wire transfer details.

We neither store nor have access to your credit card number.

We only give access to your account information to those members of our team who need it to support you, need access to payment information for accounting or maintain appropriate features on our website.

### User activity (e.g., Comments)

Please be aware that interaction with our websites, e.g., commenting or using forms, most likely leaves data and personal information. We store this information on our own server (comments) or using third party services (forms, help desks).

When you leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also your IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available [here](https://automattic.com/privacy/). After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

You can request this data or its removal. The latter can be limited by legal obligation and depends on the nature of the appropriate data.

### Passive user activity, website tracking, and cookies

By using our websites, you might also leave information.

Our website uses cookies to show different information to different users (e.g., based on their browser size, number of page impressions) for a better user experience. These cookies can last up to ten years.

If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.

By visiting this website you agree to accept cookies.

Our websites are using  **Google Analytics** , a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site.

Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing them other services relating to website activity and internet usage.

We may enable **server logs** if needed (e.g., to prevent or avert an attack on our server). Server logs contain the time, IP address, user agent, and page visited. We are keeping them only as long as needed. We are not cross-referencing them with other information.

Our products may contain attributes links to our website (e.g., manual) which we use to determine a) which features we should improve so that users need less documentation and b) which pages on our site are worth keeping updated and c) which pages we can remove, because they are no longer used.

We are using a firewall from **Sucuri** to secure and prevent our websites from attacks and hacks. We do this to protect the availability of our service and user data. They use the visitor’s IP address in encrypted form.

We use **Stripe** for payment, analytics, and other business services. Stripe collects identifying information about the devices that connect to its services. Stripe uses this information to operate and improve the services it provides to us, including for fraud detection. You can learn more about Stripe and read its privacy policy at <https://stripe.com/privacy>.

### Support Channels

We are using **Help Scout** to manage user communication (except our newsletter) and support. The advantage of mentioned service is to have all our conversations at one place, which allows us to look into similar and previous conversations to help you.

The [support forum for Advanced Ads on wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/advanced-ads) is not in our sphere of influence. If you don’t agree with their terms and [privacy policy](https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/) you may use [our own support form](https://wpadvancedads.com/support/).
