<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>PRIVACY POLICY</b></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Last Updated: January 1, 2005</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">MikeSteup.com strives to offer its visitors
the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and
personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your
name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of
this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to
any unauthorized third party. Period."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>How we gather information from users</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">How we collect and store information depends on
the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and
the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when
you register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain
features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide
information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and
chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites,
MikeSteup.com also collects information automatically and through the use
of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may
log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to
recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the
cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to
re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number of
times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we
adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means.
In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example
by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be
unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your
user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s
features according to your preferences.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>What we do with the information we collect</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Like other Web publishers, we collect information
to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising.
We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Aggregated Information (information that does not
personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine
information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from
other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages
are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information
may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again,
this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about
you or allow anyone to identify you individually.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We may use Personally Identifiable Information
collected on MikeSteup.com to communicate with you about your registration
and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services
and products offered by MikeSteup.com and other topics we think you might
find of interest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Personally Identifiable Information collected by
MikeSteup.com may also be used for other purposes, including but not
limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce
transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other
communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for
the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such
information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition,
from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy,
merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user
information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your
information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are
reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of
amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we
deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice
prior to disclosure in such cases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and
advertisements</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">MikeSteup.com expects its partners,
advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware,
however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and
other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy
and data collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to
our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a MikeSteup.com
page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also,
through MikeSteup.com you may be introduced to, or be able to access,
information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other
parties. MikeSteup.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of
such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those
third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a
third party.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">While on our site, our advertisers, promotional
partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt
to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For
example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include
cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a
particular advertisement before. Other features available on our site may offer
services operated by third parties and may use cookies or other technology to
gather information. MikeSteup.com does not control the use of this
technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible
for any actions or policies of such third parties.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You should also be aware that if you voluntarily
disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas,
that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third
parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other
individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of
MikeSteup.com and this policy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Children</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">MikeSteup.com does not knowingly collect or
solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 13
except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from
a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information
immediately. If you believe MikeSteup.com has any information from or about
anyone under 13, please contact us at the address listed below.</font></p>

continued use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms will
