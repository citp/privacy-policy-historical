# Privacy– FIGS

******FIGS Privacy Policy**

Welcome to  **www.wearfigs.com**  (the “ **Site** ”), a website operated by FIGS (“ **FIGS** ”, “ **we** ”, “ **us** ”, or “ **our** ”).  If you’re reading this, you know that our Site provides users with an opportunity to learn more about and purchase high quality medical apparel (such apparel, our “ **Products** ”).  We know you are concerned about your privacy, so we developed this privacy policy (“ **Privacy Policy** ”) to explain how we collect, use, and disclose information from and/or about you, whether you are simply visiting our Site, making a purchase, or otherwise interacting with us.

YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.  BY USING THIS SITE AND PROVIDING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE TRANSFER OF DATA FROM YOUR COUNTRY TO A COUNTRY THAT HAS LESS STRINGENT LAWS, AND THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IN CONFORMANCE WITH THIS POLICY.

So we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase  **“Personal Information”**  in this Privacy Policy, we mean contact information (e.g., name, address, email address, or telephone number) and any other information that can be used to personally identify an individual.

**Children.**

The Site is not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Site.  Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us.  We do not collect or maintain Personal Information from people we actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of our Site is designed to attract people under 13 years of age. When the Site does collect age information, and users identify themselves as under 13, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Site. Additionally, if you are under the age of majority (typically 18 or 19 years, depending on your jurisdiction), you may not purchase any Products.

**How We Collect and Use Personal Information.  **

We may collect Personal Information when you:

  * Create an Account through our Site

  * Sign-up to receive marketing communications
  * Enter a contest or participate in a promotion
  * Contact us with a comment, question or complaint

  * Apply to or participate in our Ambassador Program



_Create an Account_ **:** You do not have to create an account in order to browse our Site or place an order. If you choose to create an account, we will collect your first and last name, email address and password in order to create and administer your account. We strongly recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication (such as letters, phone calls or email messages).

These contests and promotions are voluntary.  We recommend that you read the rules for each contest and promotion that you enter.

We may retain this information to assist you in the future and to improve the quality of our Site, customer service, and Products.

_Surveys and Customer Research_ : From time to time, we may offer you the opportunity to participate in one of our surveys or other customer research.

**Information about our Site.**

  * _Information Collected by Our Servers_.  In general, you can visit our Site without telling us who you are or submitting any Personal Information. However, to make our Site more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“ **IP** ”) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. We use this information to help us understand our Site activity and to monitor and improve our Site.


  * _Log Files._ As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider ( **“ISP”** ), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Site to our users’ needs.  For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Site or again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. For more information, see the “Interest-Based Advertising” section below.


  * _Cookies_.  Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information.   **“Cookies”** are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.  This type of information is collected to make the Site more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.  


  * _     Third Party Analytics_.  We may use third party tracking and analytics services such as Google Analytics to track and analyze how visitors use our Site. Such third parties may use Cookies to help track user behavior. We do not have access or control over these Cookies. For example, Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Site, rather than your name or other Personal Information.  We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with other Personal Information. Although Google Analytics places a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Site, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google.  Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Site is restricted by the [Google Analytics Terms of Service](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/) and the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US). You can prevent the storage of data relating to your use of the Site and created via the cookie (including your IP address) by Google, as well as the processing of this data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en>. You can also obtain additional information on Google Analytics’ collection and processing of data and data privacy and security at the following link: 
    * <https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites>; and
    * <https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/2919631>


  * _Third Party Links_ : The Site may contain links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by us, including our partner sites and social media websites. We provide links to third party websites as a convenience to the user. These links are not intended as an endorsement of or referral to the linked websites. We have no control over, do not review and are not responsible for the privacy policies of or content displayed on such other websites, and therefore we have no responsibility or liability in any manner for the manner in which the organizations that operate such linked websites may collect, use or disclose, secure or otherwise treat Personal Information. When you click on such a link, you will leave our Site and go to another site.  During this process, another entity may collect Personal Information about you. The linked websites have separate and independent privacy policies, notices and terms of use. We recommend that you review the privacy policy of any new website you visit.



**Interest-Based Advertising.**

We work with third parties such as ad networks and other advertising companies that use their own tracking technologies (including cookies and pixel tags) on our Site in order to provide you with tailored advertisements across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your activity on our Site and third-party websites (such as web pages you visit and your interaction with our advertising and other communications) and use this information to make predictions about your preferences, develop personalized content and deliver ads that are more relevant to you on third party websites. This information may also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of our online advertising campaigns.

_Opting-out of Interest-Based Advertising_ : For more information about interest-based advertising and to understand your options, including how you can opt-out of receiving behavioural ads from third-party advertising companies, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance at <http://www.aboutads.info/choices> and the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada website at  <http://youradchoices.ca/choices>.  

Please note that even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising by a third party, these tracking technologies may still collect data for other purposes including analytics and you will still see ads from us, but the ads will not be targeted based on behavioural information about you and may therefore be less relevant to you and your interests.

To successfully opt out, you must have cookies enabled in your web browser (see your browser’s instructions for information on cookies and how to enable them). Your opt-out only applies to the web browser you use so you must opt-out of each web browser on each computer you use. Once you opt out, if you delete your browser’s saved cookies, you will need to opt-out again.
