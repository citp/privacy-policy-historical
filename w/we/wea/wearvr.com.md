If you have any queries or requests concerning this privacy policy or how we handle your data more generally, please contact our Data Protection Officer on [dpo@wearvr.com](mailto:dpo@wearvr.com).

If you are concerned about the accuracy of personally identifiable information maintained by WEARVR or wish to review, access, amend or correct it, or would like your personally identifiable information removed from WEARVR’s records or otherwise deactivated, please contact us at [privacy@wearvr.com](mailto:privacy@wearvr.com).

## What Information We Collect

Technical data such as IP addresses, device id, user agents and operating system version may be logged for analytics, monitoring, security and stability purposes when using any of WEARVR’s products or services.

When you sign up for any of our email newsletters, promotions or referral programs, we store your email address while you remain a subscriber. You can unsubscribe at any time using the unsubscribe link included in every email.

When you create a user account, we will ask you for enough information to create you an account that only you can log in to. If you upgrade to a developer account, we may collect additional contact details and ask you to review the information you have already associated with your account.

We keep a record of some of the actions you may perform as you interact with our products and services, such as downloading, rating or commenting. When you make a purchase our payment processors will store the financial details necessary to complete the transaction. We also request and store billing address information for European Union (EU) customers.

We may store any information you include in messages you post on, or through, any of WEARVR’s products or services or third party services or accounts belonging to WEARVR. This includes sending messages via contact, comment or feedback forms, or to our email accounts.

If you have a developer account, we store information related to the virtual reality content you have listed on WEARVR, as well as statistical information of how users have interacted with that content. We may request and store further personal information necessary for you to do business with us or our partners; if this happens, we will explain in advance what information we need, why we need it and who will have access to it.

External websites and companies with links to and from WEARVR’s online sites and products may collect personally identifiable information about users. Third party publishers may also collect personally identifiable information as a requirement of accessing their virtual reality games or body. WEARVR’s privacy policy does not extend to these external websites and companies or third party publishers. Please refer directly to these companies and websites regarding their privacy policies.

## Use of Personally Identifiable Information

We only process your information when we have a lawful basis for doing so and there is a reason permitted under data protection law. This basis may be: we need to process your information to provide you with one or more of the WEARVR products or services you have requested, or to enter into a contract; you have given us your consent; we have a justifiable reason for processing your data; or we are legally required to do so.

We process the technical and analytic data we collect to develop, deliver and improve our products, body and services. We use this data to maintain the quality and availability of the services we offer.

Purchase, download and other account activity information is used to improve the accuracy of our statistical information (such as download and view figures) and to protect and secure the content that appears on our products and services. We do not share individual user account activity with anyone other than the user that the data relates to.

We store comments and ratings you submit and we may display them next to the content that it relates to, where it is visible to other users of our products or services. We will not share or make public any messages sent via email or a similarly private or direct means of communication, unless you advise us that you would like us to do so.

We use email addresses provided by users who signed up to our email newsletter to send information about WEARVR, including news about product updates, contests, events, and other promotional materials, but only if the users agree to receive such communications.

We may use the information we have collected from developers to pay them for the content they have sold through WEARVR’s products and services, or its partners. We may also contact developers via email, from time to time, to discuss or notify them of matters relating to their existing or future virtual reality content, or to discuss opportunities or developments we believe they may be interested in.

## Who Has Access To Your Information

WEARVR will not share personally identifiable information with other parties except as described in this policy.

WEARVR may allow third parties performing services under contract with WEARVR to access and use personally identifiable information, but only to the extent necessary to provide those services.

The types of third party service providers whom we may share your information with include:

These service providers may have servers that store information outside of the EU.

WEARVR may release personally identifiable information to comply with court orders or laws that require us to disclose such information.

In the event of a reorganization, sale or merger, we may transfer personally identifiable information to the relevant third party.
