                         Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on the Internet as enjoyable 
                         and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the Internet's vast array of information, tools, 
                         and opportunities with complete confidence.
                         <br><br>
                         We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. 
                         This Privacy Policy describes how our company collects information from all end users of our 
                         Internet services (the "Services")-those who access some of our Services but do not have accounts 
                         ("Visitors") as well as those who may purchase Products and/or pay a monthly service fee to 
                         subscribe to the Service ("Members") what we do with the information we collect, and the choices 
                         Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and use of such information. We request that 
                         you read this Privacy Policy carefully.

                         <br><br>
                         Introduction. Our company collects information in different ways from Visitors and Members who 
                         access the various parts of our Services and the network of Web sites accessible through our 
                         Service. We use this information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our 
                         Products and Services, and generally, do not share this information with third parties. However, 
                         we may disclose personal information collected if we have received your permission beforehand or 
                         in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is required by law or 
                         other special cases described below.
                         <br><br>
                         Registration:  Members may be asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up 
                         for our Products or Services including name, address, telephone number, billing information 
                         (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the 
                         Services. The personal information collected from Members during the registration process is 
                         used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing purposes). This information is not 
                         shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances.
                         <br><br>
                         However, in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote our Services, we may provide 
                         the partner certain personal information, such as the name, address, and username of persons who 
                         subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of allowing us 
                         and the partner to assess the results of the promotion.
                         <br><br>  
                         In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose. We 
                         may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide 
                         during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in 
                         more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell 
                         advertisements that appear on the Services.
                         <br><br>
                         Our Company Partners and Sponsors:  Some products and services may be offered to Visitors and 
                         Members in conjunction with an affiliate, independent contractor seller or non-affiliated partner. 
                         To provide Visitors and Members some of these products and services, the partner may need to 
                         collect and maintain personal information. In these instances, you will be notified before any 
                         such data is collected or transferred and may decide not to use that particular service or 
                         feature.
                         <br><br>
                         Additionally, our partners may have advertisements or co-branded Web Pages that are cosponsored by 
                         an affiliate, independent contractor seller, or non-affiliated partner. Our company may share 
                         non-identifying and aggregate information (except as described above), but not personal information, 
                         with such partners in order to administer the co-branded products or services offered.
                         <br><br>
                         Online Shopping: At some Web sites, you can purchase products and services or register to receive 
                         materials, such as a newsletter, catalog or new product and service updates. In many cases, you 
                         may be asked to provide contact information, such as your name, address, email address, phone 
                         number, and credit/debit card information.
                         <br><br>
                         If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order sent directly to a 
                         recipient, you may be asked to provide information about the recipient, such as the recipient's 
                         name, address, and phone number. Our company has no control over the third parties' use of any 
                         personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care when doing so. 
                         <br><br>
                         If you order services or products directly from our company we will use the personal information 
                         you provide only to process that order. We do not share this information with outside parties 
                         except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
                         <br><br>
                         Online Advertisements: Our company may display our online advertisements. In those cases we share 
                         aggregated and non-identifying information about our Visitors and Members collected through the 
                         registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers.
                         <br><br>
                         Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver 
                         tailored advertisements or joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company 
                         tells us the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement tailored to the audience. 
                         Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we have collected, we may then display 
                         or send the advertisement to the intended audience. Our company does not share personal information 
                         about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers or joint venture companies.
                         <br><br>
                         Responses to Email Inquiries: When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to our company, the 
                         return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive. Our company does not use the 
                         return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any 
                         third party.
                         <br><br>
                         Voluntary Customer Surveys: We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer 
                         surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with 
                         important information that helps us to improve the types of products and services we offer and how 
                         we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, 
                         even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in our customer surveys is 
                         voluntary.
                         <br><br>
                         We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer Surveys and 
                         combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other customers we may have, to create broader, 
                         generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, 
                         employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated 
                         information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and 
                         products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with third 
                         parties.
                         <br><br>
                         Promotions: Our company may offer polls, contests, sweepstakes, drawings, games, content, or other 
                         promotions that are sponsored by or cobranded with third parties. In certain instances, company 
                         may have to supply personally identifiable information of the winners to the third parties. Our 
                         company has no control over third parties' use of this information.
                         <br><br>
                         You may be entered in a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion, simply by making a purchase from 
                         us or by providing us with personally identifiable information for some other reason or purpose. 
                         When the winning entries are chosen, only the names and personally identifiable information of the 
                         winners are shared with the entity administering the sweepstakes or contest, so that they can notify 
                         the winners.
                         <br><br>
                         Special Cases:  It is our company's policy not to use or share the personal information about 
                         Visitors of Members in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an 
                         opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
                         <br><br>
                         However, we may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, or information regarding 
                         your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our 
                         sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: credit agencies, collection 
                         agencies, merchant database agencies, law enforcement, or to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic 
                         Communications Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal 
                         requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or 
                         bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or Terms Of 
                         Service, or other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect our company and 
                         our Members.
                         <br><br>
                         Notice of Compliance to California Residents â?? Your California Privacy Rights Under The California 
                         Online Privacy Protection Act and the California Business and Professions Code.
                         <br><br>
                         This privacy policy identifies the categories of personally identifiable information that our 
                         company collects through our Web site or online service, about individual consumers who use or 
                         visit our company's commercial Web site or online service and the categories of third-party 
                         persons or entities with whom our company may share that personally identifiable information.
                         <br><br>
                         Our company does not maintain a process for an individual consumer who uses or visits our 
                         commercial Web site or online service to review and request changes to any of his or her 
                         personally identifiable information that is collected through our Web site or online service.
                         <br><br>
                         See the section below entitled "Revisions To This Policy" for a description of the process by 
                         which our company notifies consumers who use or visit our commercial Web site or online service 
                         of material changes to our company's privacy policy for this Web site or online service.
                         <br><br>

                         For the purposes of this policy and California compliance the following definitions apply:                           
                         <br><br>
                         Depending on the visitor's activity, in our commercial Web site or online service, the following 
                         "personally identifiable information" may be collected, in addition to information set forth in 
                         other sections of this document.
                         <br><br>
                         The term "personally identifiable information" means individually identifiable information about
