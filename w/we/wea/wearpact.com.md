## What kind of information does PACT Apparel, Inc. collect?

We may collect personal information from you, such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number, and credit card number when you place an order online or by phone, create an account with us online, contact us with a question or concern, or participate in a contest, promotion, or survey. We only store your order history and contact information. We do not store your credit card information on our servers. 

When you visit wearPACT.com, we collect navigational information, such as browser type and version, service-provider identification, IP address, and the site from which you came. Navigational information is largely anonymous in the sense that it doesn't contain your name, address, phone number, email address or other information that directly identifies you. 

PACT and its marketing partners use form elements and/or cookies to collect information and enable certain technology solutions used to operate our online store and to market our products. 

A cookie is a short line of text that attached to your browser when you visit a website or view a particular advertisement. This cookie can then be identified to determine how often you have visited a site or seen particular ad. Cookies are otherwise generic, and cannot be used to access any other information on your computer. 

PACT uses cookie data we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features, information and services outlined at [wearpact.com](http://wearpact.com/). PACT may also use this information to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve the way the site and PACT technology works and looks, and to create new features and functionality. Cookie data may also be used by PACT marketing partners to enhance our customers' advertising experience on wearPACT.com or other venues across the internet.

We may use your navigational information to analyze trends and traffic to our website.

## Does PACT Apparel, Inc. share my information?

When you place an order on wearPACT.com or by phone, your credit card information is securely transferred to Authorize.net, one of the largest and most trusted payment gateway providers. Your contact information is sent to our warehouse, Planet Access Company, so that they can fulfill your order. 

PACT does not share your information with any other third party other than those outlined above unless we are required to do so by law.

PACT wants to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If you prefer not to receive promotional information, such as information about special offers and sales events, you can let us know by contacting us at [info@wearPACT.com](mailto:info@wearPACT.com)

Please be sure to include your full name and the email address you used when you registered with or made a purchase on wearPACT.com or by phone. If you ask us to remove your name and address from promotional lists, we will maintain your name in a "do not contact" file to ensure that we can honor your request.

We do our best to provide you with a safe and convenient shopping experience. When you enter your personal information on wearPACT.com, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your information as it is transmitted to us and then to Authorize.net for payment processing. If you have accessed our secure server, the first characters of the address in the URL should change from "http" to "https". 

If you cannot access the secure server, or if you're not quite comfortable shopping online at wearPACT.com, please feel free to place your order with us by telephone at 800.662.PACT. 

## What is "phishing" and how do I avoid it?

"Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an email that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal information, do NOT respond. We will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal information through email. 

## What about links to other websites?
