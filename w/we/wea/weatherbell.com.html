Some uses WeatherBELL Analytics makes of this information are processing and verifying subscriptions, billing, and providing you with up-to-date information on the newest WeatherBELL Analytics products. Third parties, providers, advertisers and vendors (hereinafter "Providers") may be utilized by WeatherBELL Analytics in conjunction with the operation of the WeatherBELL Analytics Sites and the products, services, and advertising related to them. These Providers may also collect information.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">You may be asked to provide information that personally identifies you or allows WeatherBELL Analytics and/or its Providers to contact you. Generally this information is requested when you are asked to register for fee-based services, although some free products and services may also request or require registration. You may be asked to provide personally identifiable information such as your name, address, email address and billing information (collectively 'Personally Identifiable Information' or 'PII'), as well as select a username and password (if one is not selected for you by WeatherBELL Analytics).</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">To the extent unique information, which is not in itself PII, such as personal profile, anonymous identifier(s), demographic information, behavioral information, browser identifiers, session information, device type, carrier provider, unique device ID, UUID/UDID, carrier user ID, web sites visited, IP address and traffic data, is associated with PII, then such unique information shall NOT be considered PII, but shall be considered User Data. Additionally, PII does NOT include information that is collected anonymously (i.e. without identification of the individual user) or demographic or behavioral information that is not connected to or correlated with an identified individual.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong>Cookies.</strong> When you visit WeatherBELL Analytics, we send one or more cookies to your computer or other device.

SSL provides strong encryption to all digital information as it crosses the Internet. While on a secure page, such as on order forms, the lock button on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked or open when you are just surfing or in other areas of the Site.</span></span></p>

WeatherBELL Analytics may also be requested to disclose PII to law enforcement authorities or as may be required by court-ordered subpoena.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">WeatherBELL Analytics is in the business of providing and hosting weather information products, services, and other related products and services as a service to our users.
