# Washington, DC weather and forecast information on WeatherBug.com

WeatherBug wants to make your experiences with us satisfying and safe. Our data collection policies allow you to choose how much personal information to provide to us, and to control how we use that information. Our goal is to provide you with a satisfying experience while allowing you to control your privacy. WeatherBug collects and uses information primarily to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services. If you choose to register with us, you may be asked at various times to provide information such as your name, email address, and/or information about what you like and do not like. We request this information to provide our strongest value to you - a personalized experience. Customers who personalize our service come back more often - and it's the customers that visit us often who make us successful - so we do everything we can to make WeatherBug your service and to give you just the content you want. 

Information collected online is often defined as being either **_personally identifiable_** or **_anonymous_** : 

**Personally Identifiable Information** refers to information that identifies specifically who you are, such as your name, e-mail address, or mailing address. We may also ask you for demographic information such as ZIP Code,gender and year of birth. In many cases we need this information to provide the personalized or enhanced service that you have requested. We hope that, like many of our customers, you will find it beneficial to judiciously provide Information to WeatherBug so that we may provide more valuable free content and products to you. 

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. WeatherBug stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. 

Your friend may contact us at [privacy@weatherbugsupport.com](mailto:privacy@weatherbugsupport.com) to request that we remove this information from our database. 

The amount of Personally Identifiable Information that you choose to disclose to WeatherBug is completely up to you. The only way we know something about you personally is if you register for a personalized service or promotion. In other words, we will know Personally Identifiable Information about you only if you choose to share this type of information with us. 

**Anonymous Information** refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For instance, we may know that 10,000 people visited this Privacy Policy today, but we do not know their names, where they live, or their date of birth. What we collect from transactions such as this constitutes anonymous information. Some of the individuals who access our services decline to use the personalization features that are available to them, and therefore those individuals are anonymous to us and the data we collect is similarly anonymous information. Anonymous Information may be collected several ways, including through the use of cookies, web beacons or from the device that you are using. 

**Registration and Payment Information:** We may ask you to provide us with personal information on a voluntary basis in certain areas of the Site, and you will be required to provide personal information when you make purchases on the Site. The kinds of personal information that we may request may include your name, address, email address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information ("Personal Information") and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. All such information will be treated in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

**IP Addresses and "Cookie" Information:** As is the case with many sites, the Site logs your IP address and uses standard technology called "cookies," which are small data files that are downloaded onto your computer when you visit the Site. Cookies automatically identify your browser to the weatherbug.com server whenever you interact with the Site. We use cookies and the information they provide to improve our services and the quality of your experience with the Site. If you prefer not to allow us to collect "cookie" information, you can disable the cookies by turning them off in your browser, although some areas of the Site may not function properly if you do. We do not link IP addresses to your name, email address or other Personal Information. This means that your session will be tracked, but you will not be personally identified. 

**Web Beacons and Clear GIFs:** The Site may also use pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" to obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses the Site or when you are provided the opportunity to complete surveys, participate in a sweepstakes or other incentives, or open or respond to any newsletter or other email you may have received from the Site. These web beacons or clear GIFs may also be used to deliver cookies that conform to our cookie policy. 

**Use of Information From Third Parties:** Earth Networks/WeatherBug may use consumer information obtained from third party providers for a variety of purposes, including improving the accuracy of our customer database, to increase our understanding of our customer database, to increase our understanding of our customers, to identify potential new customers and to better tailor our advertising to our customers. 

**Third-Party Optimization Providers and Cookie Opt-Out:** We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize the Site. We use these services to help us measure how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by our online partners on the Site. The type of information we collect includes information provided by the customer, IP addresses, cookie information (and other information that tracks browsing history). By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our online partner logs the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. 

**Third Party Advertising Partners:** We may share your personally-identifiable information, including your name, address, email address,(if you’ve given this information to us) as well as Anonymous Information, with third-party advertising partners and service providers in order to deliver to you advertisements and other advertising tailored to your interests when you visit certain websites. Our advertising partners will make the data we provide it anonymous when utilized in advertising. To learn more about the use of this information or choose not to have this information used by our third-party advertising partners by opting out, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). 

**Links to 3rd party Sites:** Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of WeatherBug. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Web site you visit. 

**How Else Does WeatherBug Use Information That It Collects from the Site?** As well as using information about you for the specific purposes set out above, we may also use information about visitors to the Site to monitor consumer interest in our range of products and services, to troubleshoot problems that may arise on our Site, to protect against fraud or other criminal activity on our Site and other websites, to customize your user experience on the Site, to notify you of product or service offerings that we think may be of interest to you, to inform you about special promotions, and to assist us in tailoring our product lines, our services, and the content of the Site to our online visitors' needs by collecting information about their preferences through tracking patterns of page-viewing on the Site. To assist in this, at certain times, we create a profile relating to you in order to show you the content that we think you might be interested in and to display the content according to your preferences. We may also share data we collect about you, your devices and other visitors to the Site in an anonymous or aggregated form with our business partners and others. 

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. From time to time, WeatherBug may be required to share personal information in response to a valid court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful. In addition, we may share certain personal information when we believe that doing so is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property and safety of our company and/or others. WeatherBug may also share personally identifiable information with controlling entities, entities it controls, and those under common control. Finally, WeatherBug may transfer personal information to participating companies in the event of a corporate sale, merger, acquisition, dissolution or similar event, in which case, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.   
We may also share your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These service providers are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. 

**Your Rights** You can correct factual errors in your Personal Information by sending us a request that credibly shows any error. If you wish to access, update or correct your Personal Information that we collect online, please contact us by mail at the address shown in the How to Contact section below. To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. 

**Opt Out:** From time to time, WeatherBug may notify you by email of special promotions, changes to our Site, new product lines or products or service offerings that we think may be of special interest to you. If you decide you no longer want to receive emails notifying you of this information, click [here](http://replies.earthnetworks.com/functions/unsubscribed.html) to unsubscribe or follow the instructions in each promotional message. 

**Location Information.** When you use a location-enabled WeatherBug service, such as one of our mobile applications, we may collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine your approximate location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers. 

Our services have been designed to enable WeatherBug to provide hyper-local, personally relevant weather related content to those customers who wish to receive it. The majority of the services that are provided for free through WeatherBug are supported by advertising revenues. Our ability to provide enhanced services and content to our customers is dependent on our ability to provide venues for our advertising partners that reach specific demographic segments of our customer base. Generally, advertisers have little interest in reaching a specific customer of our services - and as a matter of policy we provide no mechanism for an advertiser to reach you individually or any other specific customer. Instead, our advertising partners have the need to reach customers who share common demographic or behavorial characteristics such as a specific gender or age range. For instance, certain products, such as sporting goods, may be purchased more often by men then by women, and therefore when advertising those types of products, the advertiser would prefer to target their messages just to men. The better job WeatherBug does in providing a mechanism for advertisers to reach specific sub-segments of our users, the more revenue we can generate from advertising and that, ultimately, is what allows you to get the free content that is available from WeatherBug. 

Most importantly, at no time is your Personally Identifiable Information used to determine what advertising you receive nor do we use it to determine what type of advertising any other customer of WeatherBug will receive. 

**_Below is a description of the uses of the information that we collect and how our visitors and advertisers benefit from these actions:_**

We provide personalized content in the form of weather conditions, forecasts, storm warnings, camera images, and related relevant content to our users. We pay attention to what our customers do and do not use on our service and modify our content appropriately. We match the patterns of usage that our consumers exhibit on any website where we serve advertising to create anonymous profiles about our customers. The creation of an anonymous profile allows WeatherBug to statistically model the demographic characteristics of a customer, without ever knowing that customer's name or any other Personally Identifiable Information about them. These anonymous profiles are used to target advertising to those customers, both on the WeatherBug domain and any of the other Internet domains where we serve advertising. 

The power and popularity of smartphones has enabled to us to take our hyper-local weather information and present it customers on the move. These types of services are typically known as "location based services", and they require and are enabled by the collection of specific location data from the device itself. The location data is collected anonymously, in a way that does not identify you. We use this data to send precise, location-specific weather information to our customers who activate this feature. We also share anonymous location data with advertisers to enable more relevant advertising to be served to the applications. 

On occasion, WeatherBug may offer affiliates the opportunity to host the WeatherBug application for download, and to receive branding or other consideration in return for helping us increase the number of users for our product(s). In some cases, if you have downloaded the WeatherBug application from an affiliate, the registration information that you provide may be shared with the affiliate. You will be advised prior to registering whether the information will be shared, and if so whether this is a mandatory condition of the download. Please check the affiliate's own Privacy Policy to determine their information distribution policies. 

If you choose to upload photograph(s), participate in blogs, chat rooms or other forums, on the WeatherBug community section, we will collect the Personally Identifiable Information that you wish to share with us. This may include: name, location where the photo was taken and ZIP Code where the photo was taken. If you have participated in the WeatherBug Community and wish to have a photo removed, please send your request tosupport@weatherbugsupport.com. 

Information provided within the community section of the site that is Personally Identifiable Information can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the Personally Identifiable Information you choose to submit in these forums. 

WeatherBug does offer you the ability to control the email communications we make to you. It is our intention to give you as much control over our relationship as possible. First, as mentioned earlier, the consumer always has the final word on whether WeatherBug \- or any Internet company - knows who you are. It is your choice to share Personally Identifiable Information with WeatherBug, and we encourage you to consider only sharing information with any site on the Internet in which you feel you receive true value in exchange for that information and if you respect the privacy practices of the firm. 

WeatherBug will always give you a chance to unsubscribe to any email communication from us - clear directions for doing so will appear in any email message we send to you. At times, WeatherBug may enter into co-branding arrangements with other companies, and if so, an opt-in question may be present for contact from these firms as well. Their opt-out features are specific to each organization, but you should never receive email from these organizations unless you have indicated that it is acceptable. All email from WeatherBug, or from co-brand partners who gain your permission to send you commercial email, will include an opportunity to opt out of future communications. 

We may post customer testimonials on our web site from time to time, which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer's name. We do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. 

At times, WeatherBug may enter into co-branding arrangements with other companies, and if so, an opt-in question may be present for contact from these firms as well. Their consent features are specific to each organization, but you should never receive email from these organizations unless you have indicated that it is acceptable. All email from WeatherBug, or from co-brand partners who gain your permission to send you commercial email, will include an opportunity to opt out of future communications. 

WeatherBug does reserve the right to send a one-time registration confirmation email, and infrequent Service Alert messages to its customers to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status. We may also periodically contact you regarding new or upgraded services or product offerings. We also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of our Terms of Service. WeatherBug is retaining these rights because in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters that will be important to you. 

With respect to location-based services, there is no method by which you can opt-out of the collection and sharing of geographic information. By accepting WeatherBug’s Privacy Policy and/or by using WeatherBug’s products and/or services, you consent to the collection and use of such geographic tracking technologies by WeatherBug and its advertising partners. 

If your personally identifiable information changes you may contact us at [ privacy@weatherbugsupport.com](mailto:privacy@weatherbugsupport.com) with the necessary changes. 

If you no longer desire our service, or wish to delete/deactivate our service please do the following: (1) uninstall the application and (2) send an email to [ privacy@weatherbugsupport.com](mailto:privacy@weatherbugsupport.com) requesting full removal from all WeatherBug databases. 

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
