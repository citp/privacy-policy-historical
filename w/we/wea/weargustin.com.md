#### Referral Program Terms and Conditions

LIMITED TIME ONLY. 

To participate, refer friends who have not previously made a purchase from Gustin and are not current Gustin customers (each a “referred new customer”) by sending them the personal referral link provided to you as the recipient of this invite-only special offer. Each new customer you refer who clicks on your personal referral link will receive a store credit when they sign up for an account via your referral link and make a purchase of more than $80 prior to the referral offer's expiration or modification (a “qualifying purchase”).

During this limited time offer, each referring customer will receive store credit for each qualifying purchase made by a referred new customer. You may only refer up to one (1) member of your household to receive a promo code and a referral credit. The maximum referral credit any referring customer can acquire over the course of this limited time offer is $200.

In the event a referred new customer returns a purchased item and their lifetime order value decreases below $80, the referral credit awarded to the referring customer may be rescinded. Referring customers may not refer anyone who is an existing Gustin customer, including an existing customer with an account under an alternate email address. Referring customers may not use spam or send unsolicited emails to persons they don't personally know to collect referrals and may not collect referrals by posting on message boards. Gustin reserves the right to cancel a referring customer’s referral credit if it determines in its sole discretion that a referring customer has violated these terms, including through any fraudulent or misleading referral activity (for example, by referring fake people to Gustin, using false names, using multiple identities, email accounts or email addresses, impersonating another person, or otherwise providing false or misleading information) or if Gustin terminates the referring customer’s account for any reason. Referring customers may also be liable for civil and/or criminal penalties under applicable law. Any other abuse of this offer (including but not limited to hijinks and tomfoolery), as determined by Gustin in its sole discretion, may result in the rescission of the referring customer’s referral credit and cancellation of the referred customer’s discounted order, as well as a determination that one or both parties are ineligible to participate in this or future offers. Determination of referral eligibility and qualifying purchases, as well as any exceptions, are at the sole discretion of Gustin. Gustin reserves the right to verify and adjust credits at any time prior to or following posting and redemption.

Referral credit cannot be applied to previous purchases, and is not redeemable for cash. Offer not transferable. This referral program is subject to modification, suspension or termination at any time without notice in Gustin's sole discretion.
