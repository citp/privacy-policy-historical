<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
Last Modified: Nov 15, 2013. 
</p>
<h2>WeatherSpark.com and Cedar Lake Ventures, Inc</h2>
<p class="commentx">
WeatherSpark.com is owned and operated by Cedar Lake Ventures, Inc. This is why there are a lot of references to Cedar Lake Ventures below and very few to WeatherSpark. 
</p>
<p class="commentx">
This policy is generic in nature since it is shared across multiple web properties. There may therefore be references to features not available on WeatherSpark.com. 
</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
Cedar Lake Ventures, Inc ("Cedar Lake Ventures") knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting the <a href="http://weatherspark.com">weatherspark.com</a> website and domain name, and any other linked pages, features, content, or application services offered from time to time by Cedar Lake Ventures in connection therewith (collectively, the "Website"), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. 
</p>
<h2>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
This Privacy Policy covers Cedar Lake Ventures's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Cedar Lake Ventures gathers when you access the Website and when you use Cedar Lake Ventures's services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Cedar Lake Ventures does not own or control, or to individuals that Cedar Lake Ventures does not employ or manage. 
</p>
<h2>What Personal Information Does Cedar Lake Ventures Collect?</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our customers: 
</p>
<h3>Personal Information You Provide to Us</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">
We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected include your full name, email address, IP address, browser information, username, password and any other information necessary for us to provide you with our services. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of certain features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions, sending product updates, and communicating with you about Cedar Lake Ventures's products and services, including specials and new features. 
</p>
<h3>Personal Information Collected Automatically</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or use our services. Cedar Lake Ventures automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Cedar Lake Ventures only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Website or services. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use the Website or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Cedar Lake Ventures never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally. 
</p>
<h3>E-mail Communications</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">
We compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. When you receive e-mail from Cedar Lake Ventures, you can opt out of receiving further e-mails by following the included instructions to unsubscribe. You cannot opt out of receiving certain types of account management emails such as signup confirmation, receipts of purchases made and the like. 
</p>
<h3>What about Cookies?</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. We use cookies to enhance visitors' experiences, to learn more about their use of the Website and to improve quality. 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because without cookies you will not be able to use any of our services. 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
Ads appearing on the Website may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Cedar Lake Ventures and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. 
</p>
<h2>Will Cedar Lake Ventures Share any of the Personal Information it receives?</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<i>With Your Consent: </i>Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.
