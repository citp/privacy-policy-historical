# Privacy Policy - Wealthfront

Policy Effective Date: Updated August 1, 2018

## Your Privacy Matters

Wealthfront’s number one priority is your trust. Your privacy is essential to earning and keeping that trust. This tenet drives all of the decisions we make, as well as how we gather, use and store any information we acquire from you. 

We created this Privacy Policy to be as clear and direct as possible about how we gather and use your non-public personal information and other types of personal information (“Personal Information”). Want the details? Read on. 

## Introduction

Wealthfront Corporation (formerly known as Wealthfront Inc.) and its affiliates (“Wealthfront”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”) offer financial planning and portfolio management services through an automated investment adviser service (“Service”). Our Service is made available through Wealthfront’s website, [www.wealthfront.com](https://web.archive.org/) (“Site”), or our related mobile application (“App”). This Privacy Policy describes how Wealthfront treats your Personal Information when you use or evaluate our Site, the App and/or Service or when you apply to and/or become an employee (“Employee”). 

For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, a User is an individual who uses our Site or App to understand or evaluate our Service; and a Client is an individual who signs our [Client Agreement](https://www.wealthfront.com/static/documents/client-agreements/WEALTHFRONT-BROKERAGE-TAXABLE-CLIENT-ACCOUNT-AGREEMENT.pdf) that entitles the Client to have her or his investment portfolio managed by Wealthfront. 

Our Privacy Policy, [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/legal/terms) and, where applicable, [Client Agreement](https://www.wealthfront.com/static/documents/client-agreements/WEALTHFRONT-BROKERAGE-TAXABLE-CLIENT-ACCOUNT-AGREEMENT.pdf), collectively govern your use or evaluation of our Site, App and/or Service. 

## Information Collection

The type of information we collect depends on whether you are a current or former User, Client and/or Employee. We collect Personal Information from you when you voluntarily provide it to us. Examples of instances when we collect Personal Information include: 

  * when you answer questions on the Site or in the App to determine what kind of portfolio we might recommend if you were to become a Client, 
  * when you register to open an account, 
  * when you contact our client service organization with questions, 
  * when you become a Client, or 
  * when you apply to become or become an Employee. 



Wherever Wealthfront collects Personal Information, we endeavor to provide a link to this Privacy Policy and other relevant terms, such as our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/legal/terms). 

#### Information We Collect from Users

We collect Personal Information such as name, address, telephone number and other information you may provide, such as your age, investable assets, and risk tolerance, which may include your financial goals and objectives, income information and other financial planning information about your household. 

We may collect your e-mail address and/or telephone number should you engage with us via our Site, App, or email or by calling our client service team. 

#### Information We Collect from Clients

If you choose to become a Client, in addition to the information we collect from you as a User, described above, we will ask you for certain additional Personal Information, including but not limited to: 

  * your and your beneficiaries’ full legal name, contact information, birth date, Social Security Number, citizenship; 
  * your investment objectives, approximate net worth, and other regulatory disclosures that may be necessary and required by federal and certain statutory laws (see our [Client Agreement](https://www.wealthfront.com/static/documents/client-agreements/WEALTHFRONT-BROKERAGE-TAXABLE-CLIENT-ACCOUNT-AGREEMENT.pdf)); 
  * account numbers and login credentials for the accounts (bank or brokerage) you choose to link to our Service, any challenge and/or security questions associated with those accounts and any information contained in those accounts. Note: if you choose to link to our Service, we may use a third-party service to aggregate your account data. 



#### Information We Collect when Acting As a Client’s Authorized Agent

Many of Wealthfront’s Clients choose to aggregate information from accounts at other financial institutions onto their dashboard on our Site or in our App; in enabling this functionality, Wealthfront acts as an agent to retrieve the Client account information maintained by such third-party financial institutions with which the Client has a legally-binding customer relationship (“Account Information”). This Account Information may include account balances, transactions and holdings from the linked financial institutions. 

By choosing to use our Service to aggregate and analyze Account Information, you expressly authorize and direct Wealthfront, on your behalf, to electronically retrieve Account Information. Wealthfront may work with one or more third-party financial service providers to access and retrieve your Account Information. 

#### Information We Collect from Employees

Wealthfront collects Personal Information from current, prospective and former Employees, their designated contact in case of a medical emergency, and beneficiaries under any insurance policy (“Employee Personal Information”). The Employee Personal Information we collect may include title, name, address, phone number, email address, date of birth, passport number, driver’s license number, social security number, financial information related to credit checks, bank details for payroll, external brokerage account information, holdings and trading activity, information that may be recorded on a CV, resume or other employment application form, contact information in case of an emergency, and beneficiaries under any insurance policy. Additionally, we may collect sensitive Employee Personal Information, such as details of health and disability, including mental health, medical leave, and parental leave. 

#### Information We Collect via the Referral Program

Wealthfront manages a referral program called “The Wealthfront Invite Program.” The program allows our Clients to lower their annual advisory fee in exchange for referring a person who ultimately become a client. Participation in our referral program is free and voluntary for our Clients. By participating, you may provide us with certain information about the person to whom you refer our service, such as name and e-mail address. We treat this information like all our other Personal Information. 

#### Information Regarding Children

Due to the nature of our business, Services and benefits are not marketed to minors. Except for beneficiary information as described above, Wealthfront does not knowingly solicit Personal Information from children under the age of 18. 

If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any Personal Information to Wealthfront. 

If we learn that we have collected Personal Information directly from a minor, we will delete such information from our files. 

If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child under the age of 18 has directly provided us with Personal Information without his or her consent, he or she should contact us at [support@wealthfront.com](mailto:support@wealthfront.com) and we will delete such information from our files. 

#### Other Ways We Collect Information

Other means by which we collect Personal Information include the following: 

  1. **Anonymized or aggregated Information.** Wealthfront’s Site and App automatically record certain anonymized or aggregated information about your use or evaluation of our Service. Anonymized or aggregated information is used for a variety of functions, including the measurement of Users’ interest in and use of various portions or features of the Site and App. Anonymized or aggregated information is not Personal Information, and we may use such information in a number of ways, including internal analysis, analytics and research. We may share this information with third parties for our purposes in an anonymized or aggregated form that is designed to prevent anyone from identifying you. 
  2. **Cookies and Pixels.** Similar to other technology platforms and services, Wealthfront uses cookies, a small piece of computer code that enables our Web servers to “identify” Users, each time an individual initiates a session on our Site. A cookie is set in order to identify you and tailor the Site to you. Cookies do not store any of the Personal Information that you provided to us; they are simply identifiers. You may delete cookie files from your own hard drive at any time. However, cookies may be necessary to provide access to much of the content and many of the features of the Site. 
  3. **Pixel Tags.** Along with cookies, we may use “pixel tags,” also known as “web beacons,” which are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of our Sites. A pixel tag can collect information such as the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the type of browser that fetched the pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. 
  4. **Site and App Activity.** Wealthfront may also use third-party tracking technology, such as Google Analytics, to record similar information regarding you and your activity on our Site and App. 
  5. **“Do Not Track” Technology.** We do not collect Personal Information about your online activities over time and across different web sites or online services. Therefore, our Site does not respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals. We do not knowingly authorize third-parties to collect Personal Information about your online activities over time and across different web sites or online services.

Some of these tools may store information on mobile or other devices. These tools may transmit Personal Information to Wealthfront to enable you to access your account information and to enable us to track the use of these tools. Some of these tools may enable users to e-mail reports and other information from the tool.

Wealthfront may share your Personal Information among affiliated Wealthfront entities in connetion with the provision of Services to Clients and Users.

For example, from time-to-time, we hire third-parties to perform certain business and technology related functions (e.g., mailing information, database maintenance and payment processing). In the case we hire a third party to perform a function of this kind, we endeavor to only provide them with the minimum information they need to perform their specific function and to require these third parties to safeguard your information. 

#### No Renting, Selling or Trading Out List

We will **never** rent, sell or trade your Personal Information to anyone. Ever. 

### Your Choices and Opting Out

You have the right to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your Personal Information, as set out in this Privacy Policy. 

You may decline to provide Personal Information to Wealthfront. Declining to provide personal information may disqualify you from using Wealthfront Services, Site, and App features that require certain Personal Information. 

#### Opting-Out - Obtaining and Withdrawing Consent

Where you have consented to Wealthfront’s use of your Personal Information, you may withdraw that consent at any time and opt out by contacting us by email, phone or physical mail via the contacts indicated under the “Questions and Contacting Us” section below. Additionally, before we use Personal Information for any new purpose not originally authorized by you, we will provide information regarding the new purpose and give you the opportunity to opt out. 

Prior to disclosing sensitive Personal Information to a third-party or processing sensitive Personal Information for a purpose other than its original purpose, the purposes set forth under this Privacy Policy or the purpose authorized subsequently by you, we will endeavor to obtain your explicit consent (opt-in). Where your consent for the processing of Personal Information is otherwise required by law or contract, we will comply with the law or contract.

Although Wealthfront makes good faith efforts to provide individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which we are unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If we determine that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will endeavor to provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made within one month of the request, a contact point for any further inquiries and any other legally required information. To protect your privacy, we will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making any changes to your Personal Information.

### Security
