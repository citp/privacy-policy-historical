  * Register for our services 
  * Complete a survey 
  * Register for a promotion, contest or sweepstakes

You are not required to disclose any personally identifiable information to us, although portions of our Web site may be unavailable to you without such information. 

How We Use Information

We use the information you provide to process and maintain your account, compile demographic statistics about our users and display information and advertisements that match your interests and profile.

We may also use this information to contact you about your account, or to send you necessary information directly related to the products or services you have requested. We share personally identifiable information with our third party partners where necessary to process the services you have requested.

If you order products from The Weather Channel Store, you will be required to provide contact information (e.g., name and shipping address) and financial information (e.g., credit card number and expiration date). This information will be used by our third party partner, eCompanyStore, to fulfill your order and to bill your account accordingly.

With your permission, we may use your contact information to inform you of new features and special offers from The Weather Channel. As part of the registration process, you have the option to inform us if you do not wish to receive these announcements and promotions.

**We will not provide your contact information to unaffiliated third parties without your express permission.** Credit card information will be shared with third parties only as necessary to provide products and services that you request.

E-mail Links

The Weather Channel provides various e-mail links throughout the site to help you communicate with us easily. We review the questions and comments that we receive to help us improve the site and set the direction for future enhancements. Any personal information that you provide will not be used or shared with any third parties without your explicit permission. 

IP Addresses and Cookies

The Weather Channel uses IP addresses (random numbers assigned to individual computers) to help diagnose problems with our servers, administer our Web site and anonymously track content preferences and traffic patterns. We also use cookies (small text files transferred from our Web site to your hard drive) to recognize repeat users, track usage behavior and facilitate your access to and use of our site. Cookies do not damage files or allow anyone to access your personally identifiable information - they simply allow us to tailor information and advertisements to make your visits more enjoyable and meaningful (and enable us to provide you with personalized weather information, if you choose). They also provide information to us about site usage to help us improve and update our site. We may share aggregate (not individual) site usage statistics and demographic information with advertisers and other third parties, but this information will not include any personally identifiable information.

The Weather Channel works with Real Media and DoubleClick to serve ads on our site. Some of these ads contain cookies that are used to track user behavior. This privacy policy does not cover the use of cookies set by Real Media or any other third party advertisers.

We use encryption software and other security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of sensitive information under our control. However, The Weather Channel's site includes links to other sites, and when you choose to visit those sites, we are not responsible for their privacy policies or how they treat user information. In addition, we may permit third parties to offer registration-based services through our site. We are not responsible for the actions and policies of these third parties, and you should review the privacy policies of these parties when supplying personally identifiable information to them.

Children's Privacy

The Weather Channel is committed to protecting the safety and privacy of young people using the Internet. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information about children and believe that children should get their parents' consent before giving out any personal information.
