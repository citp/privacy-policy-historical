			  <p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong><br>
The following describes the Privacy Policy for our HTTP://PROSPERITYTEAM.COM  AND ITS SUBSIDIARY WEBSITES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO:  HTTP://PROSPERITYHANGOUT.COM, HTTP://PROSPERITYFAQ.COM,  HTTP://LINKPROSPERITY.COM, HTTP://PROSPERITYFORMULA.NET, AND  HTTP://PROSPERITYVIDEOS.NET websites.<br>
<br>
<strong>Your Privacy</strong><br>
Your privacy is important to us at PROSPERITY TEAM, LLC.&nbsp; To better protect your privacy we provide  this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can  make about the way your information is collected and used.&nbsp; You agree to agree to these policies by  virtue of using our website in a way that leads to you providing us with  personal information.<br>
<br>
<strong>State Law &amp;  Accompanying Rights</strong><br>
Please understand that you may have additional rights  originating from State laws based on where you live.&nbsp; These State-based rights may augment,  strengthen, or otherwise somehow compliment any privacy rights you have  inherently or under Federal law.&nbsp; Our  policy is to comply fully with the privacy policies of every jurisdiction in  which we operate.&nbsp; Accordingly, you are  free to use our Contact information to reach us at any time to assert any State  rights.<br>
<br>
<strong>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy</strong><br>
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that  reason, our website will never collect or maintain information at our website  from those we actually know are under 18, and no part of our website is  structured to attract anyone under 18.<br>
Under our Terms of Service and Conditions of Use, children under 18 are not  allowed to use our website and access our services.&nbsp; It is not our intention to offer products or  services to minors.<br>
<br>
<strong>Collection of Personal Information</strong><br>
When visiting our website, the IP address used to access our website may be  logged along with the dates and times of access. This information is purely  used to analyze trends, administer our website, track users movement, and  gather broad demographic information for internal use such as statistical  assessments and website improvement. Most importantly, any recorded IP  addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.<br>
<br>
Other information may be collected as well by PROSPERITY  TEAM, LLC, which is rather typical of most websites.&nbsp; For instance, the source that referred you to  our website is generally known.&nbsp;  Likewise, your duration on our website, and your destination when you  leave our website can also be tracked.&nbsp;  Other common data collected includes the type of operating system the  computer you are using to access our website has.&nbsp; Similarly, the type of web browser is often  noted.&nbsp; Again, this is common data  collection, and helps ultimately produce a better end-user experience.<br>
<br>
Cookies are another common internet practice.&nbsp; Cookies are a key means of improving user  experience by allows us to customize your use of our website.&nbsp; Simple information is transferred to your  computer to allow the content and experience at HTTP://PROSPERITYTEAM.COM AND  ITS SUBSIDIARY WEBSITES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO:  HTTP://PROSPERITYHANGOUT.COM, HTTP://PROSPERITYFAQ.COM,  HTTP://LINKPROSPERITY.COM, HTTP://PROSPERITYFORMULA.NET, AND  HTTP://PROSPERITYVIDEOS.NET to reflect your actions, preferences, and so  on.&nbsp; You should simply make the  assumption our website uses cookies, and note that you are free to make  adjustments in your web browser to disable these or otherwise receive  notification of cookies so you can take whatever desired action you so  choose.&nbsp; Please understand that refusing  cookies may cripple some of our website features and render some aspects  useless to you.<br>
At times, you will be fully aware of information received,  as you are the direct source providing it.&nbsp;  For instance, you may comment on a blog post, reply to an email (whether  broadcast message or autoresponder), provide an email address, complete a  survey, requests SMS, or otherwise.&nbsp;  Likewise, purchases necessarily involve collecting certain information,  such as credit card information, Paypal addresses, your physical address for  billing and/or shipping, phone number, and so on.&nbsp; Refusing to provide some of this information  may lead to us being unable to provide you with the products or services you’ve  requested.<br>
<br>
A prime example of limited access to our website is where  some HTTP://PROSPERITYTEAM.COM AND ITS SUBSIDIARY WEBSITES INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO: HTTP://PROSPERITYHANGOUT.COM, HTTP://PROSPERITYFAQ.COM,  HTTP://LINKPROSPERITY.COM, HTTP://PROSPERITYFORMULA.NET, AND  HTTP://PROSPERITYVIDEOS.NET content may be protected by a username and  password.&nbsp; Whether a username and  password is generated by our website, or created by you, these will almost  always be connected with some other information related to or connected with  you.&nbsp; This is true since much content that  is protected on the internet is subscription based, often paid for.&nbsp; Thus, the username and password must  necessarily be tied to your other account data.&nbsp;  Usernames and passwords, by their very nature, should be kept  private.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<strong>Handling of Personal Information </strong><br>
Note that any personal information you provide to others  apart from us or our vendors is wholly optional.&nbsp; As an example, you might disclose something  in a blog post comment.&nbsp; That “private”  information is now “public,” and we have no control over that.&nbsp; In like fashion, you sharing information with  any other third party not functioning as a service provider to us puts that  information beyond our control and becomes subject to the policy that party has  in place.<br>
<br>
Our primary intention for collecting personal and private  information from you is simply to conduct our business.&nbsp; We can use this internally to better serve  you.&nbsp; Accordingly, we see no reason to  share your personal information to other parties and outside interests unless  you have authorized us to do so.&nbsp; Of  course, there are instances where your information is stored with third party  service providers, such as email service providers, as they provide services  that are industry-leading in quality and security and are far more beneficial  to our end user than attempting such services “in-house.”&nbsp; However, you are never required to deal with  any such third party directly, they are limited in how they use your  information, and they cannot sell or transfer it to others in any way.<br>
However, of course, your information does comprise part of  an overall whole.&nbsp; This aggregate of  information, by contrast, may be used to understand our overall user base.&nbsp; Further, we may share this information about  our website visitors as a whole, not individually, with third parties for  various purposes, in our sole discretion.<br>
<br>
While we are staunch privacy advocates at PROSPERITY TEAM,  LLC, there are times when even we may be forced to abandon these ideals.&nbsp; Just as major search engines face ongoing  compulsion to provide data against their will, so too may the same occur with  our HTTP://PROSPERITYTEAM.COM AND ITS SUBSIDIARY WEBSITES INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO: HTTP://PROSPERITYHANGOUT.COM, HTTP://PROSPERITYFAQ.COM,  HTTP://LINKPROSPERITY.COM, HTTP://PROSPERITYFORMULA.NET, AND  HTTP://PROSPERITYVIDEOS.NET websites.&nbsp;  Illegal activity or other serious acts or allegations could create legal  liability for our website.&nbsp; In those  cases, we reserve the right to share your information, or else may simply be  compelled to do so by law.&nbsp; On the other  hand, there may be times when we would need to share your private information  in order to protect our own interests.&nbsp;  For instance, in cases of suspected or alleged copyright infringement or  other intellectual property violations, it may be necessary to share personal  information.<br>
<br>
<strong>Google Adsense and the DoubleClick DART Cookie</strong><br>
Google, as a third party advertisement vendor, may use cookies to serve ads on  this HTTP://PROSPERITYTEAM.COM AND ITS SUBSIDIARY WEBSITES INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO: HTTP://PROSPERITYHANGOUT.COM, HTTP://PROSPERITYFAQ.COM,  HTTP://LINKPROSPERITY.COM, HTTP://PROSPERITYFORMULA.NET, AND  HTTP://PROSPERITYVIDEOS.NET websites.&nbsp;  The use of DART cookies by Google enables them to serve adverts to  visitors that are based on their visits to this website, including past visits,  as well as other websites on the internet.<br>

            <p>For the love of all that is holy, my results aren't typical. I'm in no way telling you that you will experience what i have experienced. It is my opinion that most people who purchase ANY "how to" or "business opportunity" product... including but not limited to my own, get litte if any results. I believe this is because they don't take action, and they don't keep trying after hitting the inevitable roadblock. If you want to succeed, you need to have a good plan, a sloid work ethic, and the ability to keep working toward your goals when you hit a snag. If you simply keep buying the ext "greates &amp; latest" business and never follow instruction and take action, you're wasting your time. The people illustrated throughout this site have worked hard to see results and the same opportunity exists for you if you work hard.</p>
