If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have a legal basis for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal basis depends on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:

If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use although, in some cases, this may mean no longer using our services.

All of our information, including the personal information about you described in this Privacy Notice, is stored in the United States of America.

We will retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

We may disclose aggregated (i.e. anonymized) information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual, without restrictions.

We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as described in this Privacy Notice:

  * a. To our subsidiaries and affiliates.
  * b. To contractors, service providers, and other third parties we use to support our business and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep personal information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.

To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of ICF Technology, Inc.’s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by ICF Technology, Inc. about our website users is among the assets transferred.
  * d. To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it. For example, if you give us an email address to use the "email a friend" feature of our website, or copy a co-worker on a request being made through our portal, we will transmit the contents of that email/request and possibly your email address to the recipients.
  * e. For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.
  * f. With your consent.



We may also disclose your personal information:
