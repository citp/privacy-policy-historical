Wendy's respects the privacy concerns of the visitors to its site and accordingly, no personal information is automatically obtained by visiting the site. However, Wendy's may obtain certain non-personal information from its on-line visitors. Such information includes, but is not limited to, the total number of visitors to the site in the aggregate and the name of Internet server.

There may be occasions when Wendy's obtains personally identifiable information to provide the visitor with correspondence or otherwise.

### Parents

Wendy's strongly encourages all parents to supervise their children's on-line activities and regularly monitor their children's use of the Internet. Parents should consider using parental control tools and other services to assist them in supervising their children's on-line use or on-line disclosure of their name, address or other personal information without parental consent.

Wendy's reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes.
