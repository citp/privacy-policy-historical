Wenatcheeworld.com is committed to the privacy of individuals on the Internet. The policy of wenatcheeworld.com and World Publishing Company in regards to information gathered through our Web sites is is as follows:

Wenatcheeworld.com collects identifying information about individuals only when those individuals provide that information on a voluntary basis, by registering for comments, contests, e-mail notifications and other like services.

It is the policy of wenatcheeworld.com that such information will not be made available to unrelated third parties. We will never relate specific identifying information about any of our online readers. We may let advertisers know how our online readers use our site and provide them with information about our online readers in the aggregate.

We will review our statistics occasionally, and go over server logs and IP addresses to learn more about our audience, but, again, we will not relate that information to third parties except in aggregate.

Some activity on wenatcheeworld.com, such as the individual posting identifying information in comments, may be used by third parties without our permission or endorsement. That is beyond our control. We also have no control over Web sites not operated by World Publishing Company that may contain hyperlinks to wenatcheeworld.com or that wenatcheeworld.com links to, via our banner advertisers and news links for additional information.

Wenatcheeworld.com uses 'cookies' in circumstances that require session data or require user verification.
