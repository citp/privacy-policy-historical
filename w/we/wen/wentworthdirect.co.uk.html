									cookies to provide you with a better service tailored to suit you.
								</p>
								<p>Cookies help you to save time. For example, if you register for our Services, a 
									cookie helps us to remember who you are and what your preferences are. Next 
									time you return, we can fill in any questions that you have already answered. 
									The more you tell us about yourself, the more we can help to find information 
									or products you want.</p>
