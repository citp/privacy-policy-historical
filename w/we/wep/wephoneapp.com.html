		<h1>WePhone Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>(Last updated on Jan 13, 2014)</p>
		<p>Innovation Works, Inc. ("WePhone" or "we" or "us" or "our" or other
			similar pronouns) takes your privacy matters very seriously. Please
			read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy ("Policy").
			This Policy details how we receive, collect and use information in
			connection with our website located at WePhoneNow.com (the "Site"),
			the WePhone VoIP software ("WePhone App"), and other products and
			services provided on the WePhoneNow.com website (all of the foregoing,
			collectively, the "Services").</p>
		<br>
		<h2>1. Collection and Use of Information</h2>
		<p></p>
		<h3>WePhone Application</h3>
		<p>When you install the WePhone App , you may be asked to set your
			phone number (collectively, "Personal Information"). A copy of the
			phone numbers will be stored on our servers and will only be used to:</p>
		<p>(a) support caller id display when you enable it ,</p>
		<p>(b) we may also create a function in the future that will use
			this data to facilitate your use .</p>
		<p>
			WePhone also maintains a Call Detail Record (CDR - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_detail_record" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_detail_record</a>)
			for each call conducted on the system. These are industry standard
			records used by all phone companies. We maintain this information in
			order to better understand network behavior and trends (numbers of
			calls made by users, typical destinations, call lengths, network
			type, etc.), detect potential outages and technical issues (this
			helps us notice things like a drop in call volume in a certain
			geography, a shift in call length, a change in typical networks,
			etc.) and for public safety reasons. All log analysis is done in an
			anonymous, aggregate, non-personally identifiable manner. We may look
			into a specific Call Detail Record in response to a customer support
			request.
		</p>
		<p>Audio calls by users are transmitted either directly from user
			to user or, if direct transmission is not possible (due to, for
			example, firewalls), WePhone servers are used to transmit the call. In
			the latter scenario, the information transmitted is stored briefly in
			volatile memory (RAM) solely to enable the transmission of the call
			to the other user. WE DO NOT RECORD ANY PART OF YOUR CALL IN OUR
			SERVER.</p>
		<h3>Other Services</h3>
		<p>In the event we make message boards and forums available to you
			(collectively, "Forums"), you will be solely responsible for the
			information and any other content you post on and through these
			Forums and should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose
			personal information (e.g., name, e-mail address, telephone number)
			on or through these Forums, such information is generally accessible
			to, and may be collected and used by, other users. This may result in
			unsolicited messages from third parties, and such messages are beyond
			our control. We do not exercise control over any users or Site
			visitors, and in no way are we responsible, and have any liability
			whatsoever, for any collection or use of information you may disclose
			through the Forums. This Policy does not cover such disclosure of
			information. You are encouraged to exercise discretion when providing
			personal information about yourself in and through Forums. Please do
			not post any personal information on this Site that you expect to
			keep private.</p>
		<h3>Cookies, Clear GIFs and Other Automatically Collected Data</h3>
		<p>If you have permitted your computer to accept cookies, we may
			use cookies on the Site. Cookies are pieces of information that a
			website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping
			purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier by saving preferences and
			browsing patterns while you are at the Site. Cookies may be used to
			analyze the Site usage, improve content, customize the Site's content
			and layout and for other customer service purposes. A cookie may
			enable us to relate your use of our Site to other information about
			you, including your Personal Information. All of these purposes serve
			to improve and personalize your experience on our Site. Most Web
			browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you
			and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie.
			Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer,
			your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies.
			However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from
			using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Site or
			certain areas or features of the Site.</p>
		<p>We may use "clear GIFs" (aka "Web beacons" or "pixel tags") or
			similar technologies, in the Site and/or in our communications with
			you to enable us to evaluate Site usage information about visitors to
			the Site, target campaigns, upgrade visitor information, and know
			whether you have visited a Web page or received a message. A clear
			GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a
			visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or
			other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the
			Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or
			receipt of a Web page or message. A clear gif may enable us to relate
			your viewing or receipt of a Web page or message to other information
			about you, including your Personal Information.</p>
		<p>Our servers may automatically collect data about your Internet
			address when you visit us. This information, known as an Internet
			Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that is automatically
			assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever
			you are on the Internet. When you request pages from our Site, our
			servers may log your IP Address and, if applicable, your domain name.
			Your IP Address is used to help identify you and to gather
			demographic information about our members and users as a whole, but
			does not include personally identifiable information. Our server may
			also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another
			web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Site; the
			web site you visit after this Site; the ads you see and/or click on;
			other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform,
			related software and settings you are using; any search terms you
			have entered on this Site or a referral site; and other Web usage
			activity and data logged by our servers. We use this information for
			internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our
			servers, and to administer our Services. Such information may also be
			used to gather demographic information, such as country of origin and
			Internet Service Provider.</p>
		<p>We will not link any Personal Information, including e-mail
			addresses, with aggregate data of our users.</p>
		<p>Any or all of these activities with regard to Site usage
			information may be performed on our behalf by our services providers,
			including, for example, our analytics vendor(s) and our e-mail
			management partner(s).</p>
		<h3>Third-Party Sites and Privacy Practices</h3>
		<p>You may arrive at our Site and/or download the WePhone App from
			another website. In addition, our Site may contain links that will
			let you leave our Site and access another website. Websites linked to
			or from our Site are not under the control of WePhone and it is
			possible that these websites have a different privacy policy. Our
			Policy applies solely to Personal Information that is acquired on the
			Site or through your use of our Services, and/or your relationship
			with WePhone. We urge you to be careful when you enter any personal
			information online. We accept no responsibility or liability for
			these other websites.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>2. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h2>
		<p>We do not rent, sell, or share any information about the user
			with any third-parties. We may disclose your Personal Information if
			we believe such action is necessary to:</p>
		<p>(a) comply with the law, or legal process served on us;</p>
		<p>(b) protect and defend our rights or property (including the
			enforcement of our agreements); or</p>
		<p>(c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety
			of users of our services or members of the public.</p>
		<p>We may use Apple's Push Notification Service to notify you
			about our apps. If we do, the personal information may be part of the
			message. This message is sent to Apple Inc., for delivery to your
			iPhone.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>3. Children's Privacy</h2>
		<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially
			important. We operate our Site in compliance with the Children's
			Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We never knowingly, directly
			or indirectly, collect or maintain Personal Information at or on our
			Site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our
			Site is directed at or structured to attract anyone under 13.
			Visitors younger than 13 years of age may NOT use the Services
			(including the WePhone App) and must LEAVE immediately.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>4. Security</h2>
		<p>We take reasonable precaution to protect Personal Information
			from misuse, loss and unauthorized access. Although we cannot
			guarantee that Personal Information will not be subject to
			unauthorized access, we have physical, electronic, and procedural
			safeguards in place to protect Personal Information. Personal
			Information is stored on our servers and protected by secured
			networks to which access is limited to a few authorized employees and
			personnel. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or
			method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>5. Business Transitions</h2>
		<p>In the event that we go through a business transition, such as
			a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion
			of our assets, Personal Information will likely be among the assets
			transferred. As part of such a transaction the new entity will be
			required to commit to the same level of protection of your Personal
			Information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we cannot obtain
			such a commitment, we will not perform the business transition.</p>
		<p>We will post a notice on this Site of any such change in
			ownership or control of the Personal Information we may have prior to
			such transfer.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>6. Changes to Policy</h2>
		<p>From time to time, we may revise this Policy. We reserve the
			right to update or modify this Policy, or any other of our policies
			or practices, at any time with or without notice. We will post the
			revised Policy on the Site, so that users can always be aware of what
			information we collect, how the information is used and under what
			circumstances such information may be disclosed. You agree to review
			the Policy periodically so that you are aware of any modifications.
			Your continued use of the Site indicates your assent to any changes
			and signifies your agreement to the terms of our Policy. If you do
			not agree with these terms, you should not use the Site, the WePhone
			App, or any of the other Services.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>7. Change or Removal of Information</h2>
		<p>Due to technological reasons, we do not know when and if you
			delete the application. Therefore, if we detect no activity from your
			device for 60 days, we will assume that you deleted the application
			and we will remove your data from our servers. However, since we are
			not certain that you deleted the application (you may just be on
			vacation, etc.) we will not deactivate your WePhone account (which is
			your phone number and device ID). We do not want to force you to
			register again in the event of non-use.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>8. Contact Information</h2>
		<p>
			Please direct all questions in connection with this Policy via e-mail
			to <a href="mailto:privacy@wephoneapp.com">privacy@wephoneapp.com</a>
