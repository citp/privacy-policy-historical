  <p><em>(Last updated: January 8, 2008)</em></p>

  <p><a href="http://www.weplay.com">http://www.weplay.com/</a> (“Weplay”) has
  created this privacy policy (the “<strong>Policy</strong>”) so you will understand
  when and how personal information is collected, used, disclosed and
  protected with respect to your use of our Web site (“<strong>Site</strong>”)
  located at <a href="http://www.weplay.com/">http://www.weplay.com/</a>. By using the Site or the services available
  through the Site (the “Service”), you consent to the privacy practices
  described in this Policy. This Site is owned and operated by weplay, Inc.</p>
  <p>We reserve the right to change this
  Policy at any time. If we make any material changes to our Policy, we
  will post a new policy on our Site and update the “last updated”
  date set forth above. Therefore, we encourage you to check our Policy
  whenever you use the Service to see if it has been updated since your
  last visit.</p>
  <p>For information on our privacy policy regarding children under the age
  of 13, please refer to our <a href="/t/kids">Kids Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h3>INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</h3>

  <p>We collect two basic types of information
  with our Service, namely personal information and aggregate information.
  As used herein, the term “personal information” means information
  that specifically identifies an individual (such as a first and last
  name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or other
  account number), and demographic and other information about an individual
  when directly linked to personally identifiable information. A user
  name may be personal information if it includes personally identifying
  information such as a first and last name.</p>
  <p>Our definition of personal information
  does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information
  is data we collect about a group or category of services or users from
  which individual user identities have been removed. In other words,
  information on how you use our Service may be collected and combined
  with information about how others use the Service, but no personal information
  will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps us understand
  trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features
  or otherwise tailor our Service. This policy in no way restricts or
  limits our collection and use of aggregate information, and we may share
  aggregate information about our users with third parties for various
  purposes, including to help us better understand and improve our Service,
  and for advertising and marketing purposes.</p>

  <p>Those are the types of personal and
  other information we collect. You should refer to the rest of this Policy
  to see how we use, disclose and protect this information:</p>

  <h4>Information You Give Us.</h4>
  <p>We collect information you give us
  at various times when you register with us and use our Service. Examples
  include the following:</p>

  <h4>Registration and Transaction Information.</h4>
  <p>When you register to use the Service, we may collect various kinds of
  contact information about you including, for example, your name, e-mail
  address, birth date, country of residence, and zip code. We may also
  collect demographic information that you provide to us. You will also
  be asked to create a user-chosen ID and password for your use when accessing
  the Service. Finally, you will be asked to choose a secret question
  and answer for purposes of password retrieval. </p>

  <h4>Use of Services and Interactive Areas of Site.</h4>
  <p>Personal information may also be collected
  if you provide such information in connection with participating in
  interactive areas on the Site or using the Service. For example, you
  may submit for posting on the Site images that could reasonably
  be used to identify you, and written statements and descriptions that
  could be used to identify you. Several categories of this information
  are optional, and you will have the ability to edit or remove much of
  this information at any given time. </p>

  <h4>Submissions and Customer Service. </h4>
  <p>From time-to-time we may post surveys, contests or sweepstakes on our
  Service, which may request personal or demographic information and customer
  feedback. Participation in these requests is completely voluntary and
  with each request you will have the choice of whether or not to participate
  and disclose information. We may also collect personal information if
  you provide it via e-mail, message boards, or other interactive services.
  Please do not post any information that you expect to keep private.
  In addition, we may collect and retain information that identifies you
  personally when you send us comments, questions or suggestions. </p>

  <h4>Automatically Collected Information.</h4>
  <p>We automatically receive certain types
  of information whenever you interact with us. For example, when you
  use the Service, our systems may automatically collect your IP address
  and the type of operating system or browser you use. We may also collect
  information pertaining to your account activity, information pertaining
  to the files accessed or used by you, transactional information, and
  standard access information, such as the time and date of accessing
  the Service, and usage of the Service. We use such information to help
  manage the effectiveness of our online advertising and to gather access
  information, such as counting the users who have visited those pages
  and compiling aggregated statistics about Service usage. We may also
  correlate this information with personal information through the use
  of backend analytical tools.</p>

  <h4>Cookies.  </h4>
  <p>We may also use cookie technology to collect information. Among other
  things, the use of cookies enables us to improve our Site by seeing
  which areas and features are most popular; to count the number of computers
  accessing the Site; to personalize the Site and improve the Site experience;
  to record your preferences and track the ads you view; to track your
  transactional information; and to allow you to visit the Site without
  re-entering your member ID and/or password. A cookie is a small amount
  of data, often including an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent
  to your browser from a Web site’s computers and stored on your computer’s
  hard drive. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default
  setting. You can modify the setting to reject cookies or to prompt you
  before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit by editing browser
  options. However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a
  user rejects a cookie, some portions of the Site and the Service may
  not function properly. For example, you may not be able to sign in and
  may not be able to access certain Site features or services.</p>

  <h4>Web beacons.  </h4>
  <p>“Web beacons” (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, single-pixel
  GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, 1-by-1 GIFs, and Web bugs) are tiny
  graphic files placed on a Web page which send a signal when a user has
  visited that page, allowing the site to collect standard access information,
  such as time and date of a page view, and a description of the page
  on which the Web beacon resides. We use Web beacons to help manage the
  effectiveness of our online advertising and to gather access information,
  such as counting the users who have visited those pages and compiling
  aggregated statistics about site usage.  </p>

  <h4>Information about Children Under
  13.</h4>
  <p>We recognize the need to provide additional
  privacy protections for children who visit our sites. To read about
  our protections for children who are under the age of 13, please see
  Weplay’s Kids Privacy Policy <a href="http://www.weplay.com/t/kids">http://www.weplay.com/t/kids</a>.</p>

  <h3>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

  <h4>Internal Use of Personal Information.</h4>
  <p>In general, we use personal information
  internally to process your requests or transactions, to provide you
  with information or services you request, to inform you about other
  information, events, promotions, products or services we think will
  be of interest to you, to facilitate your use of, and our administration
  and operation of, the Site and to otherwise serve our users and enable
  them to take maximum advantage of our Service. For example, personal
  information may be used: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>to request feedback and
    to enable us to develop, customize and improve the Site and our publications,
    products and services;</li>
    <li>to conduct marketing analysis,
    to send you surveys or newsletters, to contact you about our or a third
    party’s services, products, activities, special events or offers and
    for other marketing, informational, product development and promotional
    purposes;</li>
    <li>to provide products or services
    or complete transactions you have requested and to process payments
    in connection therewith; </li>

    <li>to send you a welcoming
    email and to contact you about your use of the Site, to respond to your
    emails, submissions, comments, requests or complaints, to perform after-sales
    services, to anticipate and resolve problems with our Service, to respond
    to customer support inquiries, for assistance with our product and service
    development, and to create and inform you of new products and services
    from Weplay that better meet your needs; </li>
    <li>to generate a customer profile
    for you and to select specific advertisements for you to view; </li>
    <li>to notify contest winners;
    and </li>
    <li>for the specific purpose
    for which the information was provided.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Please note that we may use your personal
  information in correlation with information collected by one of our
  partners or advertisers. Also, as mentioned above, we may correlate
  your personal information with automatically collected information through
  the use of backend analytical tools.</p>

  <p>You should review the following section
  to understand when Weplay discloses personal information to non-affiliated
  third parties.</p>

  <h4>Disclosure of Personal Information
  to Third Parties.</h4>
  <p>We do not rent, sell, or share personal
  information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies
  except (i) when we have your permission, (ii) to third party service
  providers who need access to such information to carry out their work
  for us., (iii) as part of a business transfer, or (iv) when required
  by law or permitted to protect our rights, property, or safety. The
  following section describes these disclosure circumstances more fully.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent.</strong> Unless you
    give us your consent, we will not disclose your personal information
    to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. With your consent,
    we may disclose your personal information to third parties so that they
    may provide you with products and services that you have requested. </li>
    <li><strong>Service Providers. </strong>
    We may share personal information with third party vendors, consultants,
    and other service providers who assist us in operating and managing
    the Site, the Service or our business and who need access to such information
    to carry out their work for us. For example, we may share your personal
    information with companies who are fulfilling orders, processing payment
    or other information, or administering surveys on our behalf. We may
    also share personal information with service providers who are performing
    internal analysis of the Site on our behalf, such as to estimate our
    audience size, measure aggregate traffic patterns as well as to understand
    demographic, customer interest, and other trends among our users. In
    some cases, the Service Provider may be directly collecting the information
    from you on our behalf. In the event that we use third party vendors
    to assist us in performing these functions, the third parties may not
    use or disclose your personal information for any other purpose. </li>

    <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong>
    Information about our users and the Service is one of our most important
    business assets. Therefore, information about our users, including personal
    information, may be disclosed and transferred as part of any merger
    or acquisition, creation of a separate business to provide the Service
    or fulfill products, sale or pledge of company assets as well as in
    the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal
    information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the
    company. </li>
    <li><strong>Protection of
    Weplay and Others.</strong> We may release personal information in the good
    faith belief that release is appropriate and necessary to comply with
    legal process or authority (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court
    order); to enforce or apply our policies; to initiate, render, bill,
    and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our rights, property,
    or personal safety of Weplay, our users, our employees, or the public;
    or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger
    of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure
    of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>THIRD PARTY SITES</h3>
  <p>Please be aware that we may provide
  links to third party Web sites as a service to our users and we are
  not responsible for the content or information collection practices
  of those sites. Please also note that these Web sites’ privacy policies
  will differ from those of Weplay. Therefore, we encourage you to review
  and understand their privacy practices before providing them with information
  or visiting their sites.</p>

  <h3>NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY; DATA STORAGE</h3>

  <p>Reasonable effort will be taken to
  prevent unauthorized release, corruption, or loss of your personal and
  project data. For example, we limit which teams at Weplay have access
  to your personally identifiable information. </p>
  <p>Personal information submitted by you
  is stored and maintained in our database and may be archived elsewhere.
  Our records are stored indefinitely, as are our archival backup copies.
  Weplay generates automatic backups of all system data. These backups
  are transferred using commercially reasonable efforts such as secure
  technology, and are stored on systems that are only accessible by authorized
  employees of Weplay and our third-party vendors and partners. We also
  use encryption for processing sensitive information.  While we
  have taken efforts to guard your personal information, we cannot guarantee
  that your information will not be disclosed or accessed by accidental
  circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others.</p>
  <p>Your account information and access
  to our Service is accessible only through the use of an individual user
  ID and password. To protect the confidentiality of personal information,
