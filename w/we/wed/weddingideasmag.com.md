**Our legitimate interest and your right to object:  **Legitimate Interest means the interests of our company in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service, content and offers.

For example, we have an interest in making sure our content and offers are relevant to you, so we may process your information to send you newsletters, marketing offers and partner promotions that are tailored to your specialist interests.

When we process your personal information for our legitimate interests, we make sure to consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative), and your rights under data protection laws.
