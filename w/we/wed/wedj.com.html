<br>
<b><i><font face="Times New Roman">Site Vendors:</font></i></b><br>
<font face="Times New Roman">Our service collects information from thousands of DJs, Photographers, and other wedding-related businesses throughout the Unites States and abroad.

<font face="Times New Roman">The purpose of our site is to find DJs and Photographers for wedding receptions or special events.

To assist the customer we ask for voluntary information which is stored on the customer's computer as a cookie.  It is used to help auto-populate redundant forms.  Data collected from cookie-based forms are only provided to the vendor selected, and only at the option of the customer.</font><br>
<font face="Times New Roman">Some of our pages contain a simple "Request more information" form which can be used to exchange information with our site vendors.  Each field is stored in a cookie for 7 days and can be erased by clearing the fields and leaving a page.</font><br>
<br>
<b><i><font face="Times New Roman">Registered Visitors:</font></i></b><br>
<font face="Times New Roman">Anonymous customers who want additional information by email may become a registered user of our site.  The information collected is used internally to match their interests to DJs and Photographers in their area.  Accounts may be terminated at any time by sending an email message to support@wedj.com with "remove" as the subject line.</font><br>
