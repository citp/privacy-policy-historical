### The Information We Collect

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on our website. WeDJ.com does not provide this information to any third party source. We collect information from four specific areas:

### Site Vendors:

Our service collects information from thousands of DJs, Photographers, and other wedding-related businesses throughout the Unites States and abroad. The information is used to create search results available to any person who visits the site. Vendor information is divided into two categories: public and private. 

  * Public Information: Available to any person who searches this site. Includes: company name, general location, phone number, email (provided as a link), web site (optional), and user-supplied company information text. 
  * Private Information: Used for account maintenance purposes; not available to the public. Contact name, full mailing address, actual email address, toll-free number (optional), general company statistics, and username/password.

  


### Anonymous Visitors:

The purpose of our site is to find DJs and Photographers for wedding receptions or special events. Anonymous visitors are considered the "customer" and visit our site to gather information and/or provide basic contact information to prospective DJs and/or Photographers. To assist the customer we ask for voluntary information which is stored on the customer's computer as a cookie. It is used to help auto-populate redundant forms. Data collected from cookie-based forms are only provided to the vendor selected, and only at the option of the customer.  
Some of our pages contain a simple "Request more information" form which can be used to exchange information with our site vendors. Each field is stored in a cookie for 7 days and can be erased by clearing the fields and leaving a page.

### Registered Visitors:

Anonymous customers who want additional information by email may become a registered user of our site. The information collected is used internally to match their interests to DJs and Photographers in their area. Accounts may be terminated at any time by sending an email message to support@wedj.com with "remove" as the subject line.

### Payments:

Site vendors may opt-in for account options. Electronic payments are handled externally through PayPal. WeDJ.com does not collect any information other than the product requested. For further information concerning electronic payments, please see our provider's policy (<http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/privacy-outside>).
