# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to Wedding Window, Inc. ("Wedding Window"). This Privacy Policy describes the information practices for the Wedding Window websites, including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared. As described below, this statement applies to your interactions with Wedding Window sites as well as other interactions with Wedding Window, such as when you enter into Terms of Use for a Wedding Window offering, or provide information to Wedding Window including at a trade show or other event. 

**What Information We Collect:** This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected by or submitted to Wedding Window (or carefully selected third parties acting on our behalf), including personal information. "Personal information" is data that reasonably can be used to identify or describe an individual. You do not need to provide us personal information to simply browse our site.

**Wedding Window services allow registered users to create web pages that will be generally available on the internet. Registered users are responsible for determining which, if any, personal information to include on such pages. The terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to personal information registered users, or their page visitors, choose to publish using the services.**

**Wedding Window may collect personal information when:**

  * you make purchases of products or services;
  * you request support for a Wedding Window product or service;
  * you register or otherwise create a user account on a Wedding Window Site;
  * you register for webcasts, seminars or roundtables;
  * you request information or materials;
  * you participate in surveys and evaluations;
  * you participate in promotions, contests or giveaways;
  * you apply for a job, or submit your resume to Wedding Window;
  * you submit any such information to a Wedding Window site; or
  * you submit questions or comments to us.



Wedding Window may also collect personal information from individuals (with their consent) at conventions, trade shows and expositions. 

**The types of personal information collected may include (but are not limited to):**

  * your first and last name;
  * your wedding date;
  * your home, billing, or other physical address (including street name, name of a city or town, state/province, postal code);

  * any information that Wedding Window collects online from you and maintains in association with your account, such as: (a) your Wedding Window username, (b) your Wedding Window password, and/or (c) your credit card account information.



**Use of Your Personal Information:** Wedding Window collects and uses your personal information to operate and improve its sites and deliver the services or carry out the transactions you have requested. These uses may include providing you with more effective customer service; making the sites or services easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies; and displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences.

We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements. Some Wedding Window services may send periodic member letters that are considered part of the service. We may also contact you to inform you of other products or services available from Wedding Window and its affiliates.

Personal information collected on Wedding Window sites may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Wedding Window or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using a Wedding Window site or service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.

**Sharing of Your Personal Information:** Wedding Window will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others. Wedding Window shares personal information with companies working on our behalf. Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties for their own marketing purposes unless you have provided consent.

Some Wedding Window services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services, both Wedding Window and the other company may receive information collected as part of the co-branded services. If so, the privacy policy of such other company shall apply to their use of this information.

In some cases Wedding Window uses contractors to collect, use, analyze and otherwise process information on its behalf. It is Wedding Window's practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with Wedding Window's policies. Wedding Window may also allow carefully selected Wedding Window partners to participate in limited marketing campaigns solely to promote Wedding Window's products and services to you.

If you request something from a Wedding Window site (for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials), we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we may share information with others, such as Wedding Window's business partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, and postal or government authorities (e.g., customs authorities) involved in fulfillment. As part of a transaction, we may also contact you as part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Such companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.

We may access and/or disclose your personal information if we believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on Wedding Window; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Wedding Window (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Wedding Window services or members of the public.

**Your Choices:** Wedding Window provides a number of ways for you to 'opt-out' of receiving additional information from us, or having us provide your personal information to our partners. We may offer you these choices at the time you give us your information.

If you do not wish to continue receiving certain marketing materials (e.g., e-mail messages), you can opt-out of receiving these materials by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the materials. This option does not apply to communications primarily for the purpose of administering orders, contracts, support, product safety warnings, software updates, or other administrative and transactional notices. 

**How to Update Your Information:** Here are some ways you can modify the contact information that you have provided to us:

  * Email: Should your email address change, you may manage your subscription by unsubscribing to our newsletter and re-subscribing with your new email address.
  * Account Information: Those areas of our web site that require you to register may identify, at the point of collection, the ways available for you to update your information.
