<p>II. WHAT INFORMATION DOES WEDDINGTON WAY COLLECT?</p>
<p>We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained</p>
<p>more fully below.&nbsp; We may use this Personal Information to personalize and improve our</p>
<p>services, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile, to contact users, to fulfill</p>
<p>your requests for certain products and services, to analyze how users utilize the Website,</p>
<p>and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may share certain types of Personal</p>
<p>Information with third parties (as set forth in this Section and in Section III below).&nbsp; We</p>
<p>collect the following types of information:</p>
<p><strong>A. Information You Provide to Us: </strong></p>
<p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us.&nbsp; For example,</p>
<p>during the registration process, we collect Personal Information such as your name, user</p>
<p>name, email address, IP address, browser information, credit card information, the date of</p>
<p>your wedding or the wedding you’re a part of (“Event Date”) and third-party account</p>
<p>credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Facebook or other third party sites).</p>
<p>If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you understand some content</p>
<p>GDSVF&amp;H\1224781.3<strong> </strong></p>
<p>and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”), such as your</p>
<p>third party account profile picture, may be transmitted into your account with us, and that</p>
<p>Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Website is covered by this Privacy</p>
<p>Policy.&nbsp; We may collect other Personal Information you provide us through your use of</p>
<p>our services, including without limitation your dress size, measurements, and preferences</p>
<p>regarding certain dresses.&nbsp; You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but</p>
<p>then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.&nbsp; An email</p>
<p>address is required to register with us.</p>
<p><strong>B. Information Collected Automatically: </strong></p>
<p>• Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and record</p>
<p>information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address,</p>
<p>“cookie” information, and the page you requested.&nbsp; “Cookies” are identifiers</p>
<p>we transfer to your computer through your browser that allow us to recognize</p>
<p>your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by</p>
<p>how many people.&nbsp; You may be able to change the preferences on your</p>
<p>browser to prevent or limit your computer’s acceptance of cookies, but this</p>
<p>may prevent you from taking advantage of our Website’s best features.&nbsp; Our</p>
<p>advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your computer, when you</p>
<p>click on ads that appear on our site.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy does not cover the</p>
<p>use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
<p>• We also collect usage information, including without limitation the numbers</p>
<p>and frequency of visitors to our site.&nbsp; We only use this data in aggregate form,</p>
<p>and not in a manner that would identify you personally.&nbsp; For example, this</p>
<p>aggregate data tells us how often customers use parts of the Website, so that</p>
<p>we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible.&nbsp; We</p>
<p>may also provide this aggregate information to our partners, so that they can</p>
<p>understand how often people use their services and our Website, so that they,</p>
<p>too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. We never disclose</p>
<p>aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you</p>
<p>personally.</p>
<p><strong>C. E-mail and Other Communications: </strong></p>
<p>We may contact you, by email or other means; for example, we may send you</p>
<p>promotional offers on behalf of other businesses, or communicate with you about your</p>
<p>use of the Website. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please</p>
<p>contact us at <span id="emoba-6466"><span class="emoba-em">unsubscribe<img src="http://www.weddingtonway.com/wp-content/plugins/emoba-email-obfuscator-advanced/at-glyph.gif" alt="at" class="emoba-glyph">weddingtonway<img src="http://www.weddingtonway.com/wp-content/plugins/emoba-email-obfuscator-advanced/dot-glyph.gif" alt="dot" class="emoba-glyph">com</span></span><script type="text/javascript">emobascript('%75%6E%73%75%62%73%63%72%69%62%65%40%77%65%64%64%69%6E%67%74%6F%6E%77%61%79%2E%63%6F%6D','&lt;span class="emoba-em">unsubscribe&lt;img src="http://www.weddingtonway.com/wp-content/plugins/emoba-email-obfuscator-advanced/at-glyph.gif" alt="at"  class="emoba-glyph" />weddingtonway&lt;img src="http://www.weddingtonway.com/wp-content/plugins/emoba-email-obfuscator-advanced/dot-glyph.gif" alt="dot" class="emoba-glyph" />com&lt;/span>','emoba-6466','','','0'); </script>.&nbsp; Also, we may receive a confirmation</p>
<p>when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make emails more</p>
<p>interesting and improve our service.</p>
<p>III. WILL WEDDINGTON WAY SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL</p>
<p>INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</p>
<p>GDSVF&amp;H\1224781.3<strong> </strong></p>
<p>We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form</p>
<p>to anyone.&nbsp; We share your Personal Information in personally identifiable form with third</p>
<p>parties only as described below.</p>
<p><strong>A. Advertisers:</strong> We may allow advertisers to choose the demographic</p>
<p>information of users who will see their advertisements and we may provide information</p>
<p>we have collected from you to an advertiser in non-personally-identifiable form, in order</p>
<p>for that advertiser to select the appropriate audience for its advertisements. For example,</p>
<p>we might use your interest in a certain brand of bridesmaid dress to show you ads for the</p>
<p>company that sells that brand, but we do not tell that company who you are.</p>
<p><strong>B. Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites We Do Not Control:</strong> In</p>
<p>certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell items</p>
<p>or provide services to you through the Website (either alone or jointly with us).&nbsp; You can</p>
<p>recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and</p>
<p>we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent</p>
<p>that it is related to such transaction or service.&nbsp; One such service may include the ability</p>
<p>for you to choose to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your</p>
<p>Website profile. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party</p>
<p>websites as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to allow these automatic</p>
<p>transmissions, please review all third party websites’ policies.</p>
<p><strong>C. Agents:</strong> We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our</p>
<p>behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to</p>
<p>you.&nbsp; &nbsp; Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal</p>
<p>Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.&nbsp; For example, if</p>
<p>you were to engage in a credit card transaction via the Website, we would need to allow a</p>
<p>credit card processing company to verify the transaction; however, that company would</p>
<p>only be authorized to use your credit card information to the extent we needed their</p>
<p>assistance in completing your transaction.</p>
<p><strong>D. User Profiles and Submissions:</strong><em> </em> Certain user profile information, including</p>
<p>without limitation a user’s name, email address, user name, photo, Event Date, and</p>
<p>preferences regarding certain dresses, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user</p>
<p>interaction within the Website or address your request for Company’s services.&nbsp; Your</p>
<p>account privacy settings allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal</p>
<p>Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to</p>
<p>others.&nbsp; Any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a</p>
<p>manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within</p>
<p>your public profile page, as part of a product review, etc.) becomes publicly available and</p>
<p>can be collected and used by others. Your user name may be displayed to other users if</p>
<p>and when you send messages or comments or upload images through the Website and</p>
<p>other users can contact you through messages and comments.</p>
<p><strong>E. Business Transfers:</strong> We may choose to buy or sell assets.&nbsp; In these types of</p>
<p>transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is</p>
<p>transferred.&nbsp; Also, if we (or substantially all of our assets) are acquired, or if we are</p>
<p>GDSVF&amp;H\1224781.3<strong> </strong></p>
<p>reorganized or go through some other change of control (including without limitation</p>
<p>going into bankruptcy), Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or</p>
<p>acquired by a third party.</p>
<p><strong>F. Protection of Weddington Way and Others:</strong> We may release Personal</p>
<p>Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that</p>
<p>law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights,</p>
<p>property, or safety of Weddington Way, our employees, our users, or others.&nbsp; This</p>
<p>includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud</p>
<p>protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
<p><strong>G. With Your Consent:</strong> Except as set forth above, you will be notified when</p>
<p>your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent</p>
<p>the sharing of this information.</p>
<p>IV. IS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?</p>
<p>Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security.&nbsp; You need</p>
<p>to prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and</p>
<p>protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser</p>
<p>by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>
<p>We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal</p>
<p>Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security.</p>
<p>Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may</p>
<p>compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>
<p>The Website may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the</p>
<p>privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When following a link to another site you</p>
<p>should read that site’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>V. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION CAN I ACCESS?</p>
<p>Through your account settings, you may access and, in some cases, change or</p>
<p>delete the following information you’ve provided to us:</p>
<p>• Username and password</p>
<p>• Email address</p>
<p>• User profile information</p>
<p>• Credit card and payment information</p>
<p>• Shipping address</p>
