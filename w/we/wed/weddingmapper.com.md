**Privacy Policy**

Last Updated: June 18th, 2010

**SUMMARY**

We take the privacy of our users very seriously. Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about how we treat personally identifiable information. We provide this Privacy Policy because you have a right to know what information we collect, how it is protected and used, and the circumstances under which it may be disclosed. If you have comments, suggestions, questions, or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us via email at [privacy@WeddingMapper.com](mailto:privacy@WeddingMapper.com) or in writing at: Privacy Director, Community Walk, 880 Lombard Street, San Francisco, CA 94133. 

**Online Privacy Standards.** While there are no official standards governing privacy practices on the Internet, we look to the principles supported by the Federal Trade Commission's Fair Information Practices Principles for guidance, currently available at http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/tos.htm. 

**What This Policy Covers.** This policy covers Wedding Mapper's treatment of personally identifiable information that we obtain when you visit our website or use our services. We regard personally identifiable information as information that someone can use to identify or contact you in person, such as real name, telephone number, birth date, email address, or physical mailing address. Information that we use internally to identify you as a user in our system, such as your selected username and password, is not considered personally identifiable information.

**What This Policy Does Not Cover.** This policy does not cover the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control, such as any partners or advertisers. In addition, we may provide links to other services and on occasion to other sites that may interest you. All of these sites operate independently of Wedding Mapper and they may have their own privacy or security practices. We encourage you to review their policies before submitting any personal information to them.

**1\. HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION**

**A Information You Provide**

**Registration Information.** During the registration process, we collect your first and last name and email address. We will send you an email to verify that you are the owner of this address. You will also choose a username and password that we will use to identify you in our system.

**Optional User Profile Information.** In the future, we may include optional user profile information. If we provide that as part of the service, you will be able to choose to provide us with additional optional information about yourself (for example, your name, address, age, etc.), which helps us deliver a more personalized experience to you. This information may be made available in your publicly available user profile page. 

**Access To Your Personal Information.** In general, we make it easy for you to view your personally identifiable information in your user profile page, where you can add, edit, or delete it as you see fit. You can access your user profile page by logging in at this link: [http://www.WeddingMapper.com](http://www.weddingmapper.com/) and clicking on "User Information."
