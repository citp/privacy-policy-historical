        <h2>The Way We Use Information</h2>
        <p>
            We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an
            order only to complete that order. We do not share this
            information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to
            complete that order.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use the information you provide about someone else when placing
            an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do
            not share this information with outside parties except to the
            extent necessary to complete that order.
        </p>
        <p>
            We offer gift-cards by which you can personalize a product you
            order for another person. Information you provide to us to create
            a gift-card is only used for that purpose, and it is only
            disclosed to the person receiving the gift.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such
            addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared
            with outside parties.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design
            our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may
            tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain
            area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women
            filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose
            anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable
            information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones
            described above without also providing you an opportunity to
            opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Commitment to Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure
            the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate
            physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and
            secure the information we collect online.
        </p>
        <p>
            When placing an order all credit card information is encrypted at all
            stages from your browser to our systems, and no credit card
            information is retained on our web servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            All emails and newsletters from this site allow you to opt out of
            further mailings.
        </p>

        <h2>How You Can Access or Correct Your Information</h2>
        <p>
            You can access all your personally identifiable information that
            we collect online and maintain by logging into your registered
            account. We use this procedure to better safeguard your
            information.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable
            information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.
        </p>
        <p>
            To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable
            steps to verify your identity before granting access or making
            corrections.
