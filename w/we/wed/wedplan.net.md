# Privacy Policy - WedFolio

We are committed to providing the highest quality experience for our **clients** and for our **vendors**. With that goal in mind, **WedFolio** was proactively developed with user privacy as a core concern, not as a "bolted-on" afterthought. This document describes the types of data we collect and manage and the ways in which clients and vendors may share information publicly and communicate privately. This document is part of our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/policy/terms/), and by using **WedFolio** , you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/policy/terms/).

#### Overview

There are three basic user types associated with our service: anonymous users (unregistered site visitors), **clients** (registered users who are planning their wedding), and **vendors** (registered wedding business users).

The **WedFolio** platform was designed to help clients connect with interested and available wedding service vendors and vice versa. To accomplish this we have created a robust **private** and **public** messaging system. When posting a message on our platform it will be clear whether you are posting a message publicly or you are sending a message to a vendor or client privately. In either case, any personal information you choose to post in any message is at your own discretion.

#### Messages

  * **Public messages.** At your option you may choose to post messages to the Newsfeed section of our website. Anything you post to the Newsfeed should be considered public information. We encourage clients and vendors to not disclose their contact information or other sensitive information in any public message. Clients and vendors may delete any public message they have posted to the Newsfeed at any time and for any reason by clicking the "delete" button next to the message. 
  * **Private messages.** Clients and vendors may choose to communicate with each other by sending private messages. In such cases, the contact information of the sender is not disclosed to the recipient unless the sender specifically includes that information in the message itself. We encourage clients and vendors to send each other their direct contact information if they are interested in communicating directly — outside of the **WedFolio** platform.

#### Actions

  * **Public actions.** Certain actions you may choose to take on the **WedFolio** platform as a client or vendor may be publicly available. This would include actions like posting photos, videos, updates to your public profile, and so forth. For clients, adding a vendor to your "I do's" list is a public action. For vendors, "liking" another vendor is also a public action. These social actions are designed to help clients and vendors better and more effectively interact and network with each other. 
  * **Private actions.** Most of the other actions you may choose to take on the **WedFolio** platform not mentioned in the previous section are private actions. This would include things like sending a private message to a client or vendor. For clients, adding a vendor to your "I don'ts" list is a private action. For vendors, "disliking" another vendor is also a private action. In other words, the vendor in this example would not be made aware of the client's or vendor's private action. 



* * *

#### Information

  * **Public information.** For clients, your public information would include your first name, your partner's first name, your anticipated wedding date, the anticipated location of your wedding, and other public profile information you may choose to provide. For vendors, your public information would include your company name, your company phone number, company description, business location, and other public profile information you may choose to provide. 
  * **Private information.** For clients, private information would include information such as your password. For vendors, private information would include things like your password, User ID, payment history, etc. 



We may share private information you have provided to us, including in cases where:

  * doing so is appropriate to carry out your own request;
  * we believe it's needed to enforce our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/policy/terms/), or that is legally required;
  * we believe it's needed to detect, prevent or address fraud, security, or technical issues;
  * otherwise protect our property, legal rights, or that of others.

Under certain circumstances, the government or third parties may lawfully or unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.

Additionally, in the unlikely event that we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can disclose any information about you to private entities, law enforcement, or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. We reserve the right to deny access to any or all features of the site for any reason, including cases where we believe fraud, abuse, misrepresentation, or breach of site policy has been committed by a site visitor.

#### Change of Control

Should ownership of our business change, your information may be transferred to the new owner so they are able to continue to provide you service.
