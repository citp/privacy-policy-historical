**What are Affiliates?**

Affiliates offer a service to Publishers to help them earn an income and gain insights from their commerce-related content. The service works by creating/tagging links within content that a User is reading which, if clicked, takes the User to a Merchant website where the products and/or services can be purchased. If the User then buys something as a result of clicking on these links, the Publisher is paid a referral fee by the Merchant through Affiliates. This referral fee does not come out of Users’ pockets, nor does it affect the price Users pay or the experience Users have on the Merchant’s site. 

Affiliates also offer Merchants and Advertisers a service that helps them to better understand and target Users’ behaviors, and to identify and work more effectively with Publishers and third parties on marketing campaigns. 

What information do Affiliates collect about Users through its technology and how does it use this information? 

\- They store Users’ IP addresses, from which they can determine a User’s approximate geographical location (e.g. country or region). They need this information to optimize the links that are created/monetized to suit the geography of the User, and to provide aggregate reporting to Publishers, Merchants and Advertisers on the location of users visiting Affiliates Enabled Sites. They also use IP addresses as part of our efforts to reduce fraud and identify non-human browsing patterns. 

\- They store information about the device that a User uses to access sites within our Publisher network, such as the browser type, browser version, and type of device. This helps ensure they can diagnose and fix browser compatibility issues more swiftly, optimize their service to suit the preferred browsing environments, and provide aggregate reporting to Publishers, Merchants and Advertisers. 

-They store non-identifiable information, using cookies and device identifiers, about the websites within their Publisher network that Users visit, which of their links Users click on, and whether Users make a purchase. This enables them to provide Users with relevant and useful links and advertising to products and/or services in which they are likely to be interested, and to Merchants and Advertisers from whom they are likely to want to buy. Further information regarding the cookies we utilise to collect this information can be found [here](https://skimlinks.com/user-cookies). 

\- As part of the information available in standard web serving logs, they also store information about the referrer, i.e. the website page from which the User linked to the Affiliates Enabled Site. 

\- To provide Publishers and Merchants with the Service, they collect information on visits and sales on Affiliates Enabled Sites, including but not limited to order value, products bought, and order identifiers. These are used to help Publishers, Merchants and Advertisers make better marketing and content creation decisions. At no time do they know who a User is, nor do they make any attempt to try and identify a User. 

**What Are Cookies?**

Affiliates use cookies to collect the information they need to optimize the product/Merchant links we monetize/create, and improve the service they provide to Publishers, Merchants, Advertisers and Users. Cookies also enable them to carry out audience segmentation, ie they divide Users into groups based upon defined criteria such as product usage, demographics, communication behavior and media use. They synchronize cookie identifiers with third parties in order to enrich the Service and offer personalized experiences across the web. As you browse Affiliate Enabled Sites, cookies will be placed on your Computer so that they can understand what you are interested in. These anonymous profiles allow for the customization of websites and targeting of content, including but not limited to advertising. 

**How can I disable   cookies? **

If you no longer want Affiliates to store data about the websites you visit, the links you click and the Merchants you buy from, you can simply opt-out [here](https://optout.skimlinks.com/) ([Skimlinks](https://optout.skimlinks.com/)), [here](https://www.rewardstyle.com/privacy) ([RewardStyle](https://www.rewardstyle.com/privacy)) and [here](https://account.shareasale.com/PrivacyPolicy.pdf) ([Share a Sale](https://account.shareasale.com/PrivacyPolicy.pdf)). This will mean Affiliates will not drop Affiliates cookies when you browse websites in their Publisher or Merchant network. 

Please note: This opt-out facility relies on a cookie being set on your browser. By visiting the link above, you acknowledge that they will be setting and maintaining the cookie on your browser in order to recognise you as an opted-out visitor. You must opt-out again if you clear that cookie from your browser (see allaboutcookies.org for more information), use a different internet browser, or use a different computer to access the internet. 

U.S. visitors can understand more about cookies and their choices at these websites:

EU/EEA visitors can understand more about cookies and their choices at [youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)

If you opt-out of Affiliate cookies, Affiliate will still operate on pages that you visit, and still create monetizable links in content if the Publisher has chosen to install Affiliates on its website. They just won’t optimize these links based on your preferences and behaviors, nor will they associate the websites you visit and shop from to a specific cookie. 

In order for referral fees and commissions to be paid by Merchants to Publishers, Affiliate Programs works with affiliate networks and other ad networks that manage the relationships between Affiliates and the Merchants. As set out above, Users who receive Affiliate cookies are also assigned a unique identifier number. 

When a User clicks on a link created by a Tool, The Affiliates attach the User’s unique identifier number so it passes to the appropriate affiliate network for the purpose of tracking whether that User makes a purchase on the Merchant website they visit. Note that at no time do they pass any Personal Information, nor make any attempt to determine the actual identity of an individual User; all information is completely anonymous and used only for the purposes of optimizing the service provided to the User. The affiliates use their own cookies in order to track if a sale has occurred, as most of these parties will only pay Publishers when a referral has been successful, i.e. a sale was completed. They do not have control over or access to these cookies.
