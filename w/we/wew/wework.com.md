For visitors to our Services in the EU, you may lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe our processing of your Personal Information infringes applicable law.

WeWork is headquartered in the United States. Your information will likely be collected in your country and subsequently transferred or stored in another country, including countries that may have privacy protections less stringent than your jurisdiction. In accordance with applicable law, we implement measures, such as standard data protection clauses, to ensure that any transferred Personal Information remains protected and secure. You can obtain further information about these measures by contacting us using the contact details set out below in Section 12.5.

WeWork will retain your Personal Information for as long as you have a relationship with us, and for a period after your relationship with us has ended. More

When determining how long this retention period will last, we take into account the length of time Personal Information is required to:

  * Continue to develop, tailor, upgrade and improve our Services;
  * Maintain business records for analysis and/or audit purposes;
  * Comply with record retention requirements under the law;
  * Defend or bring any existing or potential legal claims; or
  * Address any complaints regarding the services.



The security of all Personal Information provided to WeWork is important to us. WeWork takes reasonable steps endeavoring to use appropriate technical or organizational measures to protect your Personal Information, including against unauthorized or unlawful Processing and accidental loss, destruction or damage. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while WeWork strives to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to WeWork, and you do so at your own risk. As such, we ask that you help us be safer together by implementing your own security controls, such as a strong password, not sharing your credentials or badge with others, logging out when you leave your desk, and other security best practices.

We do not currently use your Personal Information in such a way that automated decisions are made about you without any human input. More

In the future, we may use automated processes to help us determine your eligibility for new services, alternate space, or other business-related opportunities. In such cases, if and as applicable, and to the extent required by applicable law, we will endeavor to implement suitable safeguards, including, for example, an opportunity for you to request human intervention, express your point of view, contest any decisions made, and request that we restrict the use of your Personal Information for the purposes of these automated decisions.

## 12.1 CCTV

WeWork’s buildings have CCTV installed to meet our legitimate business interests in protecting the safety of WeWork’s employees, members, and guests and their property, as well as to improve our products and services, and to analyze how users navigate and use our spaces. These recordings may be accessed by WeWork and Members with a need to know. These recordings may be shared with competent authorities in accordance with applicable laws, if required. The recordings are retained for a limited period of time, but may be kept longer for the investigation of an incident or when competent authorities request us to retain them.

## 12.2 COLLECTION OF INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN

Generally our Services are not directed to children under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone under the age of 16.

Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites and other online services with which a user communicates.
