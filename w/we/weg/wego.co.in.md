In addition, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Wego cookie information and the page you requested. 

We use information for three general purposes: to customise the advertising and content you see, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to contact you about specials and new products by sending you e mail alerts for new products, features, enhancements, special offers, contests, events of interest, and one-off marketing promotions. Such alerts may include marketing information about Wego, our subsidiaries or selected business partners.
