**WeCustomers.com Principles**

Here at WeCustomers.com, we believe strongly in openness and trust. The more we trust each other by being open and honest, the more we all can benefit from our collective experiences. We hope this is reflected in our privacy policy below.

In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your friends list.

You post all Posted Content (as defined in the WeCustomers.com Terms of Use) the WeCustomers.com website at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures for any website are impenetrable or 100% secure.

Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on WeCustomers.com is a violation of the WeCustomers.com Terms of Service and should be reported to admin@wecustomers.com

If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our website, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend an email inviting him or her to visit the site. WeCustomers.com stores this information to send this email, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at infowecustomers.com to request that we remove this information from our database.

WeCustomers.com may also collect information about you from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs, instant messaging services, and other users of the WeCustomers.com service through the operation of the service (e.g., photo tags) in order to provide you with more useful information and a more personalized experience.

By using WeCustomers.com, you consent to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.

**Children Under Age 13**

WeCustomers.com does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for WeCustomers.com or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on WeCustomers.com. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.

**Children Between Ages of 13 and 18**

We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.

**Use of Information Obtained by WeCustomers.com**

When you register with WeCustomers.com, you create your own profile and privacy settings. Your profile information, as well as your first name, last initial and photo, are displayed to people in the WeCustomers.com community to enable you to connect with people on WeCustomers.com. We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by WeCustomers.com that we think you may find valuable.

Profile information is used by WeCustomers.com primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the service, and to be presented to others permitted by your privacy settings to view that information. In some cases, where your privacy settings permit it, other WeCustomers.com users may be able to supplement your profile.

WeCustomers.com reserves the right to send you notices about your account, even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.

WeCustomers.com may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We may do this for purposes such as aggregating how many people in a particular network enjoy a band or product, and personalizing advertisements and promotions. We believe this benefits you
