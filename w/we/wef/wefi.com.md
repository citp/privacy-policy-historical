The WeFi Profile that you create when you sign up for our WeFi Services contains Personal Information such as your username, e-mail address and password.  Only your WeFi Member name will be visible to other WeFi Members. All the information in your WeFi Profile that you select to be publicly displayed will be public information and any WeFi Member will be able to see it, including any Personal Information that is stored in your WeFi Profile that you decide to select as public information.

### Personal Information Collected Via Technology

As you navigate our Website or use the WeFi Community Services, certain information may also be collected passively, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and viewed. This type of information is collected to better understand how you use our community and make the community and the Services we provide more useful to you.

When you use our WeFi Software to improve your connectivity, the Services collects information about the computer on which the WeFi Software is executed, including without limitation, the hardware address of its network adapter.

The WeFi Software also transmits information to the Services that allow the Services to identify your geographical location based on the Access Points you are using to establish an online connection. We may connect such geographical information with Personal Information we have collected from you, to provide you with specific location-based services that are tailored to meet your needs or interests.

An **"Internet protocol address"** or **"IP Address"** is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We track IP Addresses solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyze our web page flow. 

**"Cookies"** are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Website. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of the Website may not work properly. 

We may also contract with third parties in order to promote the products and/or services of these third parties by placing ads on the Website. We may use information that was posted by WeFi Members to tailor the display of ads to the interest of the Users. Clicking on such ads will direct you to the website of the third party and the third party may also use Cookies in connection with these ads. Please be advised that we are not responsible for these other websites or any content on these other websites and that this Privacy Statement does not govern your visit of these other websites.

### Personal Information We Receive From Other Sources

We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources like telephone or fax, or from third parties that provide services for us in connection with the WeFi Services. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Website or through the WeFi Software in order to improve our community and our Services.

### Use of Information

In general, Personal Information you submit to us is used by us either to sign you up for our community, respond to requests that you make, to improve our community and Services and to better tailor the features, performance and support of the Services and the WeFi Software, and to offer you additional information, opportunities, and functionality. We may also use your Personal Information to provide you with electronic newsletters or promotional e-mails, should you request to receive such communications from us.

The idea behind the WeFi community is that the members of our community share information and knowledge, supported by the location-based functionality of the WeFi Software. Therefore, you should assume that any information that you enter into or post on the WeFi Services (including the information in your WeFi Profile that you have selected to be public information), either through the Website or through the WeFi Software, will be openly shared with other WeFi Members and may also be available to people outside the WeFi community. Depending on where you post your information, you might be able to further specify which WeFi Members or group of WeFi Members will be able to have access to this information. Please be aware that if you enter any Personal Information into publicly available sections of the WeFi Services, this information will be displayed to anyone who has access to these sections. These publicly available sections of the WeFi Services include, without limitation, any public folder within the WeFi Services and even posts and comments of other WeFi Members.

Members are also able to search for publicly available information that was posted by a WeFi Member in a public section of the WeFi Services, or for information in a WeFi Profile.

We use the location-based information we collect from you when you use the WeFi Software of the relevant functions of the WeFi Services to provide you with specific information and services that are related to your location. Please be aware that this information might also be available to other WeFi Members.

We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you.

We may share some or all of your Personal Information with these Affiliates, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. 

If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect and defend the rights or property of us, Users and Visitors of our Website, or third parties.
