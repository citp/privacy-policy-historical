### Personal Information You Provide to Us

WeFi collects personal information from its online visitors on a voluntary basis and only to the extent necessary to fulfill your requests and to create or enhance our relationship with you. The Personal Information we gather from you helps us learn about our members and potential members of our community and the users of the WeFi Software. We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily through our Service and/or the WeFi Software. The types of Personal Information we collect are:

  * When you sign up for our WeFi Community Services, either on the Website or through the WeFi Software, we will collect the username and password that you choose and the e-mail address you provide to us.
  * When you personalize your WeFi Profile, we will collect any information you provide, such as your name or address.
  * When you enter any information, including Personal Information, into any postings or comments within the WeFi Services, we will collect such information and this information might be available for some, a subgroup of, or even all members of the WeFi Services, depending on how and where this information was posted by you (see _Use of Information_ below).
  * When you use the functionality of the WeFi Software and the Services to import data, such as contact lists, profile information, and/or address books, we will collect the information that you import and/or upload.
  * When you contact us by sending us an e-mail, we will collect your e-mail address and any information contained in the e-mail you send us.

The WeFi Profile that you create when you sign up for our WeFi Services contains Personal Information such as your username, e-mail address and password.  Only your WeFi Member name will be visible to other WeFi Members. All the information in your WeFi Profile that you select to be publicly displayed will be public information and any WeFi Member will be able to see it, including any Personal Information that is stored in your WeFi Profile that you decide to select as public information.

### Personal Information Collected Via Technology

We may collect general, aggregated, demographic, and non-personal information from our online visitors. The non-personal information will not be linked to any personal information of our online visitors, through cookies or other means, without consent. This type of anonymous, aggregated profiling and session data may include information provided to us through surveys, polls, etc., but will not be tied to any personal information without consent. The non-personal information collected may also include aggregated anonymous information about site usage and the customer base.

As you navigate our Website or use the WeFi Community Services, certain information may also be collected passively, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We also use “Cookies” and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and viewed. This type of information is collected to better understand how you use our community and make the community and the Services we provide more useful to you. Most browsers are automatically set to accept Cookies. Please contact your PC consultant if you need additional information on Cookies. Personal information collected through the use of cookies and other technology will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

When you use our WeFi Software to improve your connectivity, the Services collects information about the computer on which the WeFi Software is executed, including without limitation, the hardware address of its network adapter.

The WeFi Software also transmits information to the Services that allow the Services to identify your geographical location based on the Access Points you are using to establish an online connection. We may connect such geographical information with Personal Information we have collected from you, to provide you with specific location-based services that are tailored to meet your needs or interests.

An **"Internet protocol address"** or **"IP Address"** is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We track IP Addresses solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyze our web page flow.

**"Cookies"** are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Website. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of the Website may not work properly.

We may also contract with third parties in order to promote the products and/or services of these third parties by placing ads on the Website. We may use information that was posted by WeFi Members to tailor the display of ads to the interest of the Users. Clicking on such ads will direct you to the website of the third party and the third party may also use Cookies in connection with these ads. Please be advised that we are not responsible for these other websites or any content on these other websites and that this Privacy Policy does not govern your visit of these other websites. You are encouraged to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology. The ads appearing on our Website may be delivered to you by third-party advertising companies. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please click here http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp.

The idea behind the WeFi community is that the members of our community share information and knowledge, supported by the location-based functionality of the WeFi Software.

Please be aware that this information might also be available to other WeFi Members.

We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the information personally identifiable to you. We may use this Anonymous Information to analyze usage patterns so that we may enhance our community and Services. We reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information to third parties in our discretion.
