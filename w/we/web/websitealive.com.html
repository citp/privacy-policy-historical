The Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our site and our products and services. This statement will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and our customers' needs.</p>
      <p>What Information Do We Collect? When you visit our Web 
                          site you may provide us with two types of information: personal

    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td><p>Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") and Web server logs to collect information about how our Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site. This information is collected on an aggregate basis. None of this information is associated with you as an individual.</p>
      <p>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us? Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing customer service and making available other products and services to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Web site, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. The lists used to send you product and service offers are developed and managed under our traditional corporate standards designed to safeguard the security and privacy of our customers' personal information. As a customer, you will be given the opportunity, at least once annually, to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers.</p>
      <p>What Are Cookies? Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's Web browser on the user's hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from Web page to Web page and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet.</p>
      <p>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies? We use Web site browser software tools such as cookies and Web server logs to gather information about our Web site users' browsing activities, in order to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our customers. This information assists us to design and arrange our Web pages in the most user-friendly manner and to continually improve our Web site to better meet the needs of our customers and prospective customers. Cookies are also used within our AliveChat application to help identify return visitors, and gather user information which is useful to the operator.</p>
      <p>Cookies help us collect important business and technical statistics. The information in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by users to our Web site as they move from one page to another. Web server logs allow us to count how many people visit our Web site and evaluate our Web site's visitor capacity. We do not use these technologies to capture your individual email address or any personally identifying information about you although they do permit us to send focused online banner advertisements or other such responses to you.</p>
      <p>How Do We Secure Information Transmissions? When you send confidential personal credit card information to us on our Web site, a secure server software which we have licensed encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. The information is scrambled en route and decoded once it reaches our Web site.</p>
      <p>Other email that you may send to us may not be secure unless we advise you that security measures will be in place prior to your transmitting the information. For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as Social Security or account numbers to us through an unsecured email.</p>
      <p>How Do We Protect Your Information? Information Security. We utilize encryption/security software to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information and passwords we collect from unauthorized access or disclosure and accidental loss, alteration or destruction.</p>
      <p>Evaluation of Information Protection Practices. Periodically, our operations and business practices are reviewed for compliance with corporate policies and procedures governing the security, confidentiality and quality of our information.</p>
      <p>Employee Access, Training and Expectations. Our corporate values, ethical standards, policies and practices are committed to the protection of customer information. In general, our business practices limit employee access to confidential information, and limit the use and disclosure of such information to authorized persons, processes and transactions.</p>
      <p>How Can You Access and Correct Your Information? You may request access to all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing techsupport@websitealive.com.</p>
      <p>Do We Disclose Information to Outside Parties? We do not provide aggregate information about our customers, sales, Web site traffic patterns and related Web site information to our affiliates or reputable third parties; this information includes personally identifying data, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?<br>
  We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights.</p>
      <p>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site? We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site nor the information or content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web site.</p>
      <p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Web site to another Web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other Web site, including Web sites which have a link on our Web site, is subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p>
      <p>Your Consent. By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our Web site to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.</p></td>

    <td><p>In order to access certain subscriber services and restricted areas (the "Restricted Services") within the WebsiteAlive site (the "Site"), AYU Technology Solutions LLC ("WebsiteAlive") requires that you provide certain identifying information (the "Registration Data") listed in the online registration form. This information may include your legal name, address, telephone number(s), e-mail address, subscriber name or "screen name," areas of interest, password used to access Pay services, method of payment, and, if applicable, credit card number. WebsiteAlive reserves the right to request any additional information necessary to establish and maintain your account for use of the Pay Services.</p>
      <p>Confidentiality. Registration Data is the property of WebsiteAlive, subject to and protected by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. WebsiteAlive will not sell, rent, swap, or otherwise disclose your Registration Data to any third party. WebsiteAlive maintains a secured area on the Site for transmission of Registration Data, and stores all Registration Data in a private database which is not connected to the Internet.</p>
      <p> Uses of Registration Data. Unless you select the "Opt-Out" option as described below, WebsiteAlive reserves the right to use your Registration Data to send you information about WebsiteAlive, the Site, WebsiteAlive products and services, and other topics in which you have indicated an interest.</p>
      <p>Opt-Out Right. If you do not wish to receive any special offers or other communications from WebsiteAlive, you have the right to select the "opt out" option during the registration process or at any time afterwards. You may "opt out" by clicking on the box marked "I DO NOT WISH TO RECEIVE SPECIAL COMMUNICATIONS FROM WebsiteAlive" when you register for an account or at any time afterwards by going to the "Special Offers" area of the Site.</p>
      <p>User Access to Information Collected. You may access your Registration Data at any time through the Subscriber services section of the Site. This area is password-restricted for your protection.</p>
      <p>Lost or Stolen Information. If your credit card or password is stolen or used without your permission, immediately notify WebsiteAlive. Upon notification WebsiteAlive will cancel your credit card number and/or password and update its records. You may be unable to access certain services while WebsiteAlive processes the credit card and/or password change.</p>
      <p>Cancellation. You may cancel your account at any time by sending an e-mail to newaccounts@websitealive.com. Once WebsiteAlive has finished processing the cancellation, WebsiteAlive will delete all your Registration Data from its database. </p>
      <p>No Liability for Acts of Third Parties. Although WebsiteAlive will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of the Registration Data, transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. WebsiteAlive will have no liability for disclosure of Registration Data due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties.</p>
      <p>Use of Aggregated Information. WebsiteAlive reserves the right to disclose to third parties information about Subscriber usage of the WebsiteAlive Web site and any related services, including information gathered during your use of the Site. Any information disclosed will be in the form of aggregate data (such as overall patterns or demographic reports) that does not describe or identify any individual user.</p>
      <p>Updates. WebsiteAlive reserves the right to change or update this Privacy Policy, or any other company policy or practice, at any time with reasonable notice to users of the Site. Any changes or updates will be effective immediately upon posting to the Site. </p>
