			<p>NeuStar, Inc., is a provider of mission-critical telecommunications and Internet infrastructure services, whose mission is to remain the trusted neutral third party that these industries have come to rely upon. NeuStar is sensitive to the privacy concerns of those that we serve and therefore, we have developed state-of-the art privacy programs to ensure the security and protection of the data that we collect through the provision of our mission-critical services. </p>
            <p>Because NeuStar gathers certain types of information about the users who visit the NeuStar Web site located at <a href="http://www.neustar.biz">http://www.neustar.biz</a> Web site ("NEUSTAR.BIZ"), we believe you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the use of the information we collect. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for NeuStar. Please review the following statement to understand how the information you provide to NeuStar will be treated. </p>
            <p><b>1. Information NeuStar Collects</b></p>
            <p>You are free to visit NEUSTAR.BIZ without identifying yourself; however, if you would like more information regarding our products and services, you may be required to first register with NeuStar. When you register, we will request certain business information, including your name, address, and e-mail address. This information will enable NeuStar to contact you regarding the products and services provided, as well as provides us with aggregate demographic data that NeuStar uses to improve the services offered to users. </p>
			<p>In addition to registration, NeuStar may, from time to time, request personal information for purposes such as the provision of customer service, network management, surveys, offers of related services, and other exchanges of information. </p>
            <p>NeuStar gathers information about all users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services users access most often. NeuStar automatically logs IP addresses, session sources, and other data which tracks users' access to NEUSTAR.BIZ and the other channels and NeuStar sites. We analyze these logs in order to understand aggregate user behavior as well as for system performance monitoring. These logs are analyzed for the overall, aggregate trends they reveal about our customers, not for individual user behaviors. </p>
			<p><b>2. What NeuStar does with the information it collects. </b></p>
            <p>The information you supply to NeuStar will not be given, sold, rented, loaned, or otherwise disclosed to any third parties outside of NeuStar, except when we have your express permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with legal process, (ii) enforce the service terms and conditions, or (iii) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of NeuStar, its customers, or the public. </p>
			<p>NeuStar may use aggregated information to determine the demographics of our users and to distribute statistics and general marketplace information about NeuStar. These demographics will always represent aggregate information and will never identify a specific user. Certain non-personal information regarding users is recorded by the operation of the Internet servers hosting the NeuStar sites. NeuStar may disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe the service to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. </p>
			<p><b>3. What is a cookie? </b></p>
            <p>A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information that allows a Web site to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. NeuStar uses cookies to tell when a user is a repeat visitor and to let us know how the user found the site. They also allow us to automatically link users to their personalized accounts. When you create an account, NeuStar uses a cookie to store a unique, random code. NeuStar only uses this code to identify you anonymously in our database and to track the pages you visit on our site. This helps us better understand and improve areas of the site that our users find valuable. NeuStar also uses this code to enable you to enter various services as a member and to visit member-restricted areas of the site without having to log in each time. </p>
            <p>If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. Though some of the services require the use of cookies, visitors to NEUSTAR.BIZ always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. However, some of the services will not work if you have cookies disabled. </p>
