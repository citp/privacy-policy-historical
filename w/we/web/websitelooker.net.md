**1.Introduction and general terms**

websitelooker.net is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy, which is a binding part of websitelooker.net's Terms of Use and End User License Agreement ("Agreement"), explains the type of information websitelooker.net collects through its website and the websitelooker.net browser companion software ("Status Bar Addon Service") and what websitelooker.net does with it.

websitelooker.net'S STATUS BAR ADDON SERVICE COLLECTS AND STORES INFORMATION ABOUT THE WEB PAGES YOU VIEW. ALTHOUGH websitelooker.net DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO ANALYZE WEB USAGE DATA TO DETERMINE THE IDENTITY OF ANY websitelooker.net USER, SOME INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE STATUS BAR ADDON SERVICE IS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE. websitelooker.net AGGREGATES AND ANALYZES THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS TO IMPROVE ITS SERVICE AND TO PREPARE REPORTS ABOUT AGGREGATE WEB USAGE.

Please read the following privacy policy carefully before downloading and using websitelooker.net's Status Bar Addon Service software or using the websitelooker.net website. If you download and use websitelooker.net's Status Bar Addon Service software or use the websitelooker.net website, you will be bound by the terms of the Agreement, including this Privacy Policy.

websitelooker.net's Status Bar Addon Service provides you the information as to how much a website is worth. It does this by logging and analyzing the Web surfing patterns of websitelooker.net users, which we call usage paths.

websitelooker.net does not attempt to determine the identity of any websitelooker.net user by analyzing Web usage paths.

**2.What types of information will websitelooker.net collect?**

If you are visiting the websitelooker.net website (websitelooker.net), we collect the following information: the full Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the Web page from which you came to websitelooker.net; your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, which may include a domain name; the date and time for each page you view.

If you download and install the Status Bar Addon Service software, which provides the websitelooker.net Status Bar Addon, we collect any information voluntarily provided by you during the installation and registration process, which can include your e-mail address as well as demographic information such as gender, age, occupation, household income, zip code and country. Any e-mail address that you may give us during the installation process is kept separate from information collected during your use of the Status Bar Addon Service and is not used to correlate your identity to Web usage path.

When you use the Status Bar Addon Service, we collect information about the websites you visit, and the pages you view. This information allows us to provide you with information about the Web page you are viewing and to estimate as to how much a website is worth. Thus, for every Web page you view while using the Status Bar Addon Service, the websitelooker.net software transmits and stores the following information from your computer to websitelooker.net:

  * Your IP address, which may include a domain name.
  * The full URL of the Web page you are visiting.
  * The date and time the above information is logged.



All of the above information is logged together in a single data string for each Web page you visit. Each string is logged in our database in the chronological order received from our users.

**3.Does websitelooker.net collect personally identifiable information?**

Sometimes the URLs we collect through the Status Bar Addon Service contains personal information about you. For example, when you enter information on a Web page (e.g., when you complete an online registration form or sign up for a contest), the operator of the website may insert that information into its URL for that or the next page. This information often appears after a question mark ("?") in the URL, although it can appear in other places. This means that your name, your address, your e-mail address, or similar information you might consider private or personally identifiable which you enter into a Web page sometimes becomes part of a URL that is then transmitted to websitelooker.net and automatically stored in websitelooker.net's databases. This can also occur with words, topics, products, or phrases you enter into search engines - whether those engines are provided by the websitelooker.net Status Bar Addon Service itself or found elsewhere on the Web - while using the websitelooker.net Status Bar Addon Service. websitelooker.net has no control over what information third party websites put into their URLs or where they put it, but any information in each URL is collected and stored by websitelooker.net when you are using the Status Bar Addon Service.

websitelooker.net analyzes its logs of usage path, to determine Web usage of users in the aggregate.

If you e-mail websitelooker.net, we may store copies of such e-mail or similar communications between you and websitelooker.net. This can result in the collection of your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information you may have in your e-mail text, addresses, or other fields, as well as the collection of the your IP address, the Internet or other routing of your communication, and the date and time of your communication.

Although these information logs may contain personally identifiable information, websitelooker.net does not attempt to correlate usage paths or demographic information to your e-mail address and does not attempt to determine the identity of any websitelooker.net user by analyzing this information, except as required by subpoenas, court orders or legal requirements.

All transmissions between you and websitelooker.net, including e-mails, URLs, usage paths, and any personally identifiable information they might contain, pass through many third party machines, operating systems, programs, browsers, Web servers, networks, routers, Ethernet switches, ISPs, proxy servers, intranets, the public telephone systems, or other devices, any of which may create activity logs containing such transmissions.

We use IP addresses to diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our website.

We generally do not inform users of such requests for information, although we might try to do so in some cases.

We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as technical support services. To perform those functions, it may be necessary for them to obtain access to websitelooker.net's databases and servers, which may contain personally identifying information about users. They may not use such access or information for any purpose other than that for which they are retained.

**_Glossary of Terms_**

**Usage Paths**

A usage path is the trail of requests automatically transmitted to and logged by websitelooker.net as user surfs the Internet with the websitelooker.net Status Bar Addon enabled. Usage paths consist of the following data for each Web page visited by a websitelooker.net user: (a) the IP address assigned to the user; (b) the date and time the Web page is visited by the user; (c) the full URL that the site assigns to the Web page.

**Uniform Resource Locator**

A URL (or uniform resource locator) is the full Web address of a file or document you view when browsing the Internet. With most browsers, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox, the URL of every Web page that you view is displayed in a window near the top of the screen. Typically, a URL consists of four parts: protocol, server (or domain) where the file is located, path, and filename. However, some URLs have no path or filename. An example of a URL is:

http://www.websitelooker.net/company/index.html

http is the protocol  
www.websitelooker.net is the server  
company/ is the path  
index.html is the filename

**Internet Protocol Address**

An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a set of numbers that is automatically assigned to your computer each time you connect to the Internet. When you use your Web browser to request a Web page from another computer on the Internet, your Web browser automatically gives that computer your IP address so that the data you request can be sent to your computer. For many users who access the Internet from a dial-up Internet service provider (ISP), the IP address will be different every time they log on ("dynamic" IP addresses); others may be assigned only one IP address that remains the same from session to session ("static" IP addresses) (more common with broadband ISPs).

**Domain Name**

A domain name identifies one or more IP addresses. Domain names are used in URLs to identify particular Web pages. For example, in the URL http://www.websitelooker.net/site/company, the domain name is websitelooker.net.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small data file consisting of numbers, letters, or other characters that a server sends to your browser and stores on your computer's hard drive. The cookie automatically identifies your computer, but not your identity.

You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) However, if a browser is set to reject cookies, it may encounter functionality problems with the websitelooker.net Status Bar Addon Service.

**Status Bar Addon**

The websitelooker.net Status Bar Addon consists of buttons or links on your Web browser and enables you to use the websitelooker.net Status Bar Addon Service.

**Browser**

A browser, short for Web browser, is a software application used to locate and display Web pages. Two popular browsers are Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer.
