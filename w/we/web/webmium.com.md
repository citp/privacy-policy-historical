# Privacy on Webmium

At Webmium we care about your privacy and the security of your personal data. We comply applicable with applicable data privacy laws and regulations for your safety and security. In the following we describe what information is collected and how we handle it. This policy applies to all of the Webmium Products. Webmium is a service offered by the Czech company Nexum Trilog a.s. ([www.nexum.cz](http://www.nexum.cz/)).

If you have any questions about this Policy, please don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:privacy@webmium.com) or write to Webmium Project, ATTN:  **nexum Trilog a.s.,  ** Kolbenova 942/38a,  190 00 Praha 9, Czech Republic.

Webmium collects, processes, and uses personal data of a user without further necessary agreement only insofar as it is necessary for the establishment, fulfillment, and billing of the contract.

Webmium is a website building and hosting service provided at [www.webmium.com](http://www.webmium.com/) and its directly associated domains, tools, services and applications that are operated by Nexum Trilog a.s. (collectively, "Webmium" or "Services").

This "Privacy Policy" explains what information we gather from our users and how we use it. By using or accessing our Services, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. (Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meaning set forth in our [Terms of Service](http://www.webmium.com/en-US/terms)).

Webmium is not intended for children under 13 years of age. Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), we will never knowingly gather or use personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13, and we do not allow anyone under the age of 13 to register on Webmium.

## What information does Webmium gather?

Webmium gathers and stores three types of information about users that are subject to our Privacy Policy:

### Information users provide to us:

These are voluntary submissions made when creating an account on Webmium or through your use of the Services, such as your name, date of birth, location and email address provided during registration, Content posted, or payment information provided during purchases. Please understand that when you sign into Webmium or post Content, your information is not anonymous to us.

### Information we collect when you interact with Webmium:

We keep track of the actions you take on Webmium, such as adding an application, or posting Content. Also, when you access our Services, we may collect information about your access method (such as hardware and software attributes), location, IP address, and pages you visit. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies". (For more on cookies, please see the section What are cookies?)

### Information we receive from third parties:

We do not own or operate the third-party applications, user Webmium websites and other services offered that you may use or interact with through Webmium (collectively, "Webmium-enhanced" applications, Webmium websites and services). Whenever you visit, use or interact with a Webmium -enhanced application, Webmium website or service, we will receive information from them, including information about actions you take and Content you post on that application, Webmium website or service.

## Why does Webmium gather information about me?

Webmium collects information in order to provide a safe, efficient and customized experience. This information allows us to better tailor our content to users' needs and to help us better understand the demographics of our audience. Webmium may use some of this information for contacting you, customizing the content and advertising you view, improving our services, conducting research, and providing anonymous reporting for clients. We only collect personally identifiable information from you because you are voluntarily submitting the information to us in order to enjoy certain Services.

## How will Webmium websites and Applications on Webmium treat my information?

As mentioned above, we do not own or operate Webmium-enhanced applications, Webmium websites and services. We take steps to ensure that providers of Webmium -enhanced applications, Webmium websites and services use information that you share on Webmium in a manner consistent with your privacy settings and the terms of this Privacy Policy, but we cannot guarantee that they will follow our rules. Please take the time to familiarize yourself with the privacy settings of your account, as well as the settings and policies of the applications, Webmium sites and services that you visit, add or use on Webmium.

## How is information shared?

Webmium will not share your personally identifiable information with others except as described herein with regards to sharing with Webmium -enhanced applications, Webmium websites and services and in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is reasonably necessary to offer the Services, legally required, or permitted by you. For example, we may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the Services at a co-location facility for servers, to register your domain name, to send out email updates about Webmium, to provide you with email functionality for your domain, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for products or services, or to provide search results or links (including sponsored links). In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time.

Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the Webmium-specified purposes. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of Webmium (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers). Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose personal information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process received by Webmium , whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the [Webmium Terms of Service](http://www.webmium.com/en-US/terms) or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety or rights of members of the public or users of the Services. Webmium reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of Webmium or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.

## How am I notified of changes to this Privacy Policy
