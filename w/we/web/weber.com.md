 **Q. How do I know my credit card information is secure?**  
To make sure you are accessing our secure server before you submit personal financial information, look at the lower right-hand corner of your browser. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the URL or Location line of your browser. If you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the address in that line should change from "http" to "https." 

Some browser versions and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders at www.weber.com. If for any reason you cannot access the secure server, please feel free to place your order with us by phone at 1-800-446-1071. Our Customer Service representatives will be happy to assist you.
