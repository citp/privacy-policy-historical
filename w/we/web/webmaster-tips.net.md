###  3\. Cookies.

In compliance with the European Union legislation, we inform you that our website Webmaster-tips.net will store some information about your preferences how the website looks and operates on your own computer inside a tiny file called a 'cookie'. 

A cookie is a small piece of data that a website asks your browser to store on your computer or mobile device. The cookie allows the website to "remember" your actions or preferences over time. 

You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work. 

Most browsers support cookies, but users can set their browsers to decline them and can delete them whenever they like. A third-party website called [aboutcookies.org](http://aboutcookies.org/) has been setup to help you with instructions how you can do that on various browsers. 

We use cookies to:
