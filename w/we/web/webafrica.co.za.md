**Status**

  2. This Privacy Policy forms part of the [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/legal/terms/) of this website. Continued use of this website means you agree to the provisions of this Policy and are bound by them.




**Collection of personal data**

  3. We collect only what is necessary and use it only for the purpose for which it is required.

  4. We will neither sell your personal information to anyone nor otherwise dispose of it to a third party otherwise than as set out in the Policy. We will not attempt to obtain your permission to do so by deceptive means.

  5. If we do not need it anymore, we will delete any personal information held.

  6. We neither store nor retain any credit card information.




**Email communications**

  7. When you send us personally identifying information in an e-mail, we use the information you provide only to help us gather the information you might request. In an effort to respond to your request, information you submit may be viewed by various people within Web Africa. Once received, the information to your e-mail is protected in accordance with this Policy.




**Collection of anonymous data**

  8. In order to provide the best possible and most relevant service, we may use standard technology to collect information about the use of this site. This technology is not able to identify individual users but simply allows this web site to collect statistics.

  9. In order to do this we use cookies. A cookie is a small file that is placed on your hard drive in order to keep a record of your interaction with this web site and will log:

    1. The Internet protocol (IP) address from which you access our website. An IP address is the unique number that is automatically assigned to the computer you are using whenever you are surfing the web.

    2. The type of browser (such as Internet Explorer or Mozilla) and operating system (such as Windows Vista or MacOS) used to access our site.

    3. The date and time when the website is accessed, for the purpose of traffic and statistical monitoring.
