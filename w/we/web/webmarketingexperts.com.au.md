**What is Web Marketing Experts Privacy Statement?**

Our web server makes a record of your visit and logs the following information for statistical purposes - the user's server address, the user's top level domain name (eg. .com, .gov, .au, .uk etc.), the date and time of the visit to the site, the pages accessed and documents down loaded, the referring site and the type of browser used. No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect the web server's logs.  

  **What do we do with the data collected in our privacy statement?**

  Web Marketing Experts uses this information to improve our services and capabilities in operating our business for the consumer. We do not sell, provide, or allow our information to be viewed by any other person other than those employed by Web Marketing Experts.  

  **Why do we collect email addresses?**

  Web Marketing Experts collects email addresses for correspondence so we may keep you up to date with our new products, special offers, promotions, and company news.  

  **Can Web Marketing Experts customers order with anonymity?**

  As Web Marketing Experts requires a physical address to deliver parcels to and a signature on delivery, anonymity cannot be assured.  

  **Links to Other Sites**

  This website may contain links to other websites that may collect personal information from you. This privacy policy has no application to these websites and Web Marketing Experts is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites.  

  **How can Web Marketing Experts customers' information be removed from our database?**

  If at any stage a SkinB5 customer would like their information removed from our database, we require an email and some form of identification then your file will be deleted from our records. Please send such request to: [info@webmarketingexperts.com.au](mailto:info@webmarketingexperts.com.au)
