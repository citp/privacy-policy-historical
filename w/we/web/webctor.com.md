**EFFECTIVE DATE: 10 OCTOBER 2011.**

  3. Any personally identifiable information that you provide will be secured with industry standard protocols and technology.




We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of the personal and other information we receive from Users of the Site.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on the home page of the Site.

Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Use. By continuing to use the Site after notice of changes have been sent to you or published on the home page of the Site, you are consenting to these changes.

You willingly provide us certain personal information, which we collect in order to allow you to benefit from the Site. If you have any hesitation about providing such information to us or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, you should not become a User of the Site.

**The Site and third party sites**

This Privacy Policy applies solely to the Site. The Site may contain links to third party sites that are not owned or controlled by the Owner. The Owner has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party site. You agree that you are responsible for reviewing and understanding the privacy policies (if any) of any third party sites you may access through this Site. By using this Site, you release the Owner from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party site to which this Site may be linked.

Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve the services and specific tools offered within the Site and the related features, to administer your subscription and to enable Users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site. Below are the types and categories of information that we collect.

**Account**

You may use some of the functionality of the Site without registration, however in order to access some features or other elements of the Site, you will have to create an account. If you use the Site without creating an account, the only information we collect will be non-identifying information related to the use of cookies or web beacons. When creating your account you benefit from number of different services we provide. In this respect you are required to provide the following information, which you recognize and expressly acknowledge are personal information allowing others, including the Owner, to identify you: username, email address, password chosen by you, city/state, and in case you are a professional your name, surname and specialization. It is important that you must keep your account password secure and confidential. We do not require you to submit us any personal information concerning your health, like information about medicines you take or diseases you have. If you provide us with such an information you recognize and expressly acknowledge that you do this on your own discretion. We may also ask you to provide additional information after you register if you want to obtain additional services or information or to resolve complaints or concerns. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of any personal information you submit. Inaccurate information will affect the information you receive when using the Site and tools and our ability to contact you as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Inviting friends**

If you like to tell a friend about the Site, we will ask you for your name, your email address and your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him/her to visit the Site. We do not use your name, your email address or your friend's email information for any other purpose. We will only use the information you provide to send the email you request.

**Forums, message boards, Q &A, groups, etc.**

When you post any message to a forum, message board, Q&A, group or any other public forum within the Site where User can post his/her observations and comments on designated topics, your basic information will be available for all registered Users to see. This basic information consists of your username, or name and specialty in case you are a specialist. You should not post any information about you or any other person to a forum, message board, Q&A, group or other public forums within the Site if you want to keep such information private or you are required by law to do so. Information you post to public forums within the Site is considered public information and may be used by us and third parties. As with any public forum on any site, this information may also appear in third party search engines like Google, Yahoo, MSN etc. We do not control the information indexed and cached by search engines.

**P** **rivacy settings**

We allow you to set the privacy settings for some of the personal information you provide. You can set the privacy setting to private, public, or friends only. Public information can be seen by everybody without limitation. Viewers do not have to be registered Users in order to view this information. Friends only information can be viewed by other registered Users that you have elected to add as a friend. Private information can only be seen when logged in under your username or by the Owner. You should think carefully before disclosing any personally identifiable information or information concerning your health in any public forum within the Site.

**Log Data**

When you visit the Site or use its functionalities, whether as a registered or a non-registered User our servers automatically record information about your use of and your visit to the Site ("Log Data"). The Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type, what software you were using, the web page you were visiting immediately prior to visiting the Site, pages of the Site you visited, the time spent on those pages, information you searched for on the Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and for the Site's technical administration, to improve the functionality of the Site and User-friendliness, and to better tailor it to Users' needs.

**Cookies**

Like most sites, the Site uses cookies and web log files to track the Site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows us to recognize you as a User when you return to the Site using the same computer and web browser. If your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use the Site properly. Like the information you enter at registration, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the Site.

One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once you have logged in to your account. The next time you visit the Site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing User so you will not need to log in before using the Site.

Additionally, if you log out of the Site you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called a “session” cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.

We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing User preferences and tracking User trends. In the course of serving advertisements or optimizing services to Users, we may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Any information provided to third parties through such cookies will not be personally identifiable. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies or you opt to refuse all cookies, you may not be able to use the Site, the certain areas within this Site or its services properly. We do not store personally identifiable information in the cookies.

**Web B** **eacons**

We allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to Users. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.

To deliver these ads properly, the Site may include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by the Site so the networks may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other sites.

Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.

These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other sites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. We do not provide personally identifiable information to any advertiser or any other third party.

**Log files, IP addresses and information about your computer**

Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the Site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave the Site. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, email patterns, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the Site services. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is not shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required by law.

**Communications**

We will communicate with you through email and notices posted on the Site or through other means available through the Site, including text and other forms of messaging. We may use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of material changes of this Privacy Policy or for user service purposes). If we send any communications to you via the carrier service with which you have a mobile communications subscription or otherwise have access, you understand you will pay any service fees associated with any such access (including text messaging charges for messages to your mobile device). Please be aware that you may receive certain emails from the Owner related to the proper functioning of your account. You can change your e-mail and contact preferences at any time by logging into your account and amending your email notification choices. By clicking "Sing Up" during the registration process, you also consent to receive commercial or marketing messages from the Owner and/or its partners.

**Sharing i** **nformation with third parties**

We take the privacy of Users very seriously. We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes. We will only share your personally identifiable information with third parties to carry out your instructions or to provide specific services or information. These third parties do not retain, share, or store any personally identifiable information except to provide these services and they are bound by confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information.

We may provide aggregated anonymous information about the usage of our Site to third parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate, including to prospective advertisers on the Site.

**Teaming with third parties**

We allow other companies to place advertisements on the Site. These companies use technology to deliver advertisements you see on the Site directly to your browser. In doing so, they may automatically receive your IP address. Other companies that place advertising on the Site may have the ability to use cookies and/or web beacons to collect information, including information about your usage of the Site. We do not control the processes that advertisers use to collect information. However, IP addresses, cookies and web beacons alone generally cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines. Therefore, advertisers and others whose advertisements or content may appear on the Site generally will not know who you are unless you provide additional information to them, by responding to an advertisement, by entering into an agreement with them, or by some other means.

**Legal disclaimer**

We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including without limitation subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of the Owner or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.

**Disclosures to others**

We may also disclose your personal and other information you provide, to another third party as part of a reorganization or a sale of the assets of the Owner’s division or company. Any third party to which we transfer or sell our assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us.

**Phishing**

Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to the Owner. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.

**Aggregate information and non-identifying information**

We may share aggregated information that does not include personal information and we may otherwise disclose non-identifying information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your personal information.

**International transfer**

Your information may be transferred to "and maintained on" computers or servers located outside of your state/country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to such transfer.

**Links to other sites**

Our Site contains links to other web sites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by clicking on a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party's web site. The fact that we link to a web site or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party web sites. These other web sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect information or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other web sites you visit.

**Accessing and changing your account information**

You can review the information you provided us and make any desired changes to them, or to the settings for your account including your email at any time by logging in to your account on the Site. Please be aware that even after your request for a change is processed, we may, for a time, retain residual information about you in our backup and/or archival copies of our database. We take your rights seriously and encourage you to use them if you deem this to be appropriate. You may exercise these rights by emailing us at support@webctor.com.

**Deleting your account**

You can also delete your account, in which case you can still use the Site, but we may not be able to provide certain services to you. If you delete your account, we may retain certain information contributed by you if we believe it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally identifiable information, account recovery, or if required by law. In order to delete your account please visit “Delete Account” section associated with your account.

You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our servers.
