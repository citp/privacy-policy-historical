# Privacy Policy | WebCentral

**Updated March 2015**

**1\. Introduction**

1.1 We understand that the privacy of your personal details, and the security of your transactions with us, is of paramount importance to you. WebCentral's Privacy Policy sets out the rules we will abide by when dealing with personal information we collect from individuals in the course of our business. This policy is consistent with the Australian Privacy Principals of the Privacy Act 1988.

1.2 We may make alterations or additions to this policy from time to time. Should we do so, we will update the policy on our web site. We require that all our customers agree to abide by our Privacy policy as part of our terms of trade. This policy also applies to users of our web site who are not customers of WebCentral.

1.3 Please note that we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for the privacy or security practices of any other web sites which you may be able to access through our site, or for our customers' level of compliance with our code.

**2\. What Information Do We Collect?**

WebCentral collects different information about you at different times. These are the broad categories of information that we collect from you:

2.1 Information we require to supply our services.

  * When you first sign up or contract with WebCentral for our services, or when you make an inquiry about our services, we collect information such as your name, address, telephone number, domain name, email details of your primary and secondary contacts, credit card details (if you are paying online). We may also collect other identifying details such as your age and gender. In order to verify your identity, we will ask you to provide questions and answers to security questions.
  * We may also monitor and/or record telephone conversations with you from time to time in order to train staff and to improve our service to you.



2.2 Non personally identifying information.

  * In addition to the information you specifically provide above, WebCentral operates statistics gathering software on its web site to collect information about the number of visitors coming to the site. No identifying information is collected by this software. The software records the IP address of the visitor only. We use this information to improve our own technical structure and performance, and to determine which areas of our web site are most popular.
  * We also use 'cookies' and HTML5 web storage. A cookie is a small message given to your web browser (on the device you are using) by our web server in order to store information about user preferences. We also use cookies to track your interaction with our website, personalise your experience on our website and provide information on our product offerings through content networks across the internet (such as tailored advertising to you). HTML5 web storage is similar to a cookie, but allows enhanced functionality and capability of data storing and use when you utilise our website. You always have the option to disable cookies and/or HTML5 web storage by turning them off in your browser but you may find that this reduces the functionality of our website. Additionally, you can install a browser add-on and opt-out of interaction recording which will limit this tracking functionality and opt-out of tailored advertising programs. 



2.3 Other demographic information.

We may use your information to measure your experiences of our products/services/website, improve or develop our products/services/website, and perform research and analysis. Also, if you respond voluntarily to any of our surveys or other interactive communications, we will collect those responses and use the information to improve the quality and range of WebCentral's products and services.

**3\. How Do We Use Personal Information We Have Collected?**

3.1 We collect and use your personal information to operate our web site and deliver our services to you. We will use your personal information to provide you with: sales and technical support, billing and credit control, product upgrades and information, renewal notices, maintenance notices, system changes and other functions relevant to your services with us.

3.2 When you contract with WebCentral for our services or make enquiries of our services, you will be requested to provide your consent to us to send promotional material to you. You may stop the delivery or "opt out" of future promotional email from WebCentral by following the specific instructions in the email you receive. These instructions will tell you how to remove your name from our promotional email list.

3.3 We may use your personal information to:

3.5 We will disclose your personal information, without notice or your consent, only:

  * to protect and defend the rights or property of WebCentral;
  * if we consider it necessary to do so in order to enforce or apply the terms of any of our agreements with you;
  * to contractors providing licensed collections services, credit card payment processing and CRM services, who comply with our privacy and security policies;
  * if we sell our business or part of it; and
  * in extreme circumstances, to protect the personal safety of users of WebCentral's services, its web site, our staff or the public.

Only staff who need to have access to your personal information in order to perform their job function are authorised to access the database. Constant changes to the Internet and technology mean that we cannot guarantee that data transmission will be 100% secure, or safe from attack by unauthorised intruders.

If you lose control of your password, you may lose control over your personal information and may be liable for actions taken on your behalf by third parties using your password and/or personal information. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change it.

6.3 If you collect personal information which you keep on servers provided by WebCentral as part of our service to you (including email), you alone are responsible for compliance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) in respect of that information.
