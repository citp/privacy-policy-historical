			address, mailing address, phone number, credit card information or 
			other information. You may, however, visit our site anonymously.<br>
			* Like many websites, we use "cookies" to enhance your experience 
			and gather information about visitors and visits to our websites. 
			Please refer to the "Do we use 'cookies'?" section below for 
			information about cookies and how we use them.<br>
			<br>
			<b>How do we use your information?</b><br>
			We may use the information we collect from you when you register, 
			purchase products, enter a contest or promotion, respond to a survey 
			or marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other 
			site features in the following ways:<br>
			<br>
			* To personalize your site experience and to allow us to deliver the 
			type of content and product offerings in which you are most 
			interested.<br>

			<b>How do we protect visitor information?</b><br>
			We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety 
			of your personal information. Your personal information is contained 
			behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number 
			of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are 
			required to keep the information confidential. When you place orders 
			or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure 
			server. All sensitive/credit information you supply is transmitted 
			via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our 
			databases to be only accessed as stated above.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Do we use "cookies"?</b><br>
			Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider 
			transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if 
			you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to 
			recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. 
			For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the 
			items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us 
			understand your preferences based on previous or current site 
			activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We 
			also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site 
			traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site 
			experiences and tools in the future.<br>
			<br>
			We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in 
			better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are 
			not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except 
			to help us conduct and improve our business.<br>
			<br>
			You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is 
			being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this 
			through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) 
			settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your 
			browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. 
			If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that 
			make your site experience more efficient and some of our services 
			will not function properly. However, you can still place orders over 
			the telephone by contacting customer service.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Do we disclose the information we collect to outside parties?</b><br>

			parties" does not include Steakbrands.com. It also does not include 
			website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in 
			operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so 
			long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.

			appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or 
			protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.<br>

			<b>How can you opt-out, remove or modify information you have 
			provided to us?</b><br>
			To modify your e-mail subscriptions, please let us know by modifying 
			your preferences in the "My Account" section. Please note that due 
			to email production schedules you may receive any emails already in 
			production.<br>
