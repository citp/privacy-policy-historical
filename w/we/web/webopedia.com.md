That information may include your (a) name, (b) address, (c) e-mail address, (d) telephone number, (e) credit or debit card number, and (f) driver's license number (for auto insurance offers).

In some cases, we may collect additional information you provide, such as your age, date of birth, gender, occupation, and education level. On our financial services Sites, with your consent, we may collect your Social Security number to verify your identity with a credit bureau and obtain your credit report and credit score. On certain Sites, we may also collect from you information about your contacts, such as their email address, to share an article or other content.

_Information from Third Parties:_ We may also collect information about you from third parties, like credit reporting agencies or a social media site or a plug-in you use to log into or connect to this Site, and authorize to send us information from that social media account (e.g., name, age, photo). We may associate or combine the information you provide through this Site with this information collected from third parties.

_Information Automatically Collected:_ When you use this Site, the server may automatically recognize you by a "cookie" or other tracking technology.

Furthermore, we may retrieve certain information from your browser (e.g., browser type, referrer URL, date and time of your visit, IP address) and device (e.g., MAC address, device type, screen resolution, and OS version). We use this information to monitor this Site's performance, analyze traffic patterns and usage, ensure that this Site and any transactions function properly, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. This information also may be appended to your user profile so that we may further tailor this Site to your interests and send offers to you based on such information.

Our advertisers, publishers and other third-party partners also may utilize third-party cookies and other tracking technologies like clear pixel GIFs (i.e., web beacons) to identify you. We and our third-party partners may use these technologies to measure responses to e-mails and page views on this Site and our third-party partners' websites. These technologies collect no personal information and are used to enhance this Site, to make this Site more relevant to you, and to measure the effectiveness of our e-mail and advertising campaigns and those of our third-party partners.
