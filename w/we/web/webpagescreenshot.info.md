Of course you must protect your connection and insure that it is secure and that others cannot view it. 

When you install the extension you receive a code which is totally random. Every picture that you send is the extension include this code. This number is for solving problems that may arise with the users, and to allow the user to view or erase previous pictures.

When the extension is installed a folder is created in your Google Chrome profile. We do not save any other files or data on your computer except on this folder. When you uninstall the extension this folder is erased.

When you take a screenshot we do not save the picture file, you must do so yourself by choosing "save" or share.
