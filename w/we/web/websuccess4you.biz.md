How we gather information from users 

The information collected from our users it used for the purpose of building their website as described in the Plug-In Profit Site signup page. You will be asked for your name, e-mail address, affiliate ID#'s, domain name and hosting account username and password. Once your website is setup, you will also receive follow-up training emails at the email address provided in your application. You may opt-out of these emails at any time. Like most Web sites, PlugInProfitSite.com also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s features according to your preferences. 

If you choose to use our referral service (located inside the Plug-In Profit Site member's area) to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. PlugInProfitSite.com does not store this information and only uses it for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email on your behalf. 

What we do with the information we collect 

Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone. 

Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually. 

We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on PlugInProfitSite.com to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by PlugInProfitSite.com and other topics we think you might find of interest through the email you provide upon signing up for the Plug-In Profit Site service. You can opt-out of these emails at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link located in each email or by contacting privacy@pluginprofitsite.com with your request. 

Part of the process of signing up for the Plug-In Profit Site service includes signing up for 5 affiliate programs and a hosting service. SFI, Success University, Empowerism and Host4Profit each send a confirmation email to the referring affiliate which contains the name and e-mail address you used to create those accounts. This information is not used by PlugInProfitSite.com. 

Personally Identifiable Information collected by PlugInProfitSite.com may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other service related communications with you.

These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. In such a case, all Plug-In Profit Site members will be notified by email and given the option to opt-out of future communication if desired. We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
