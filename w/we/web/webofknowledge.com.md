# Privacy notice - Clarivate

Effective: May 25, 2018

### 1\. Scope

This Privacy Notice describes how Clarivate Analytics (“Clarivate”, “we”, “us” and “our”) collects, uses, shares, secures, and eventually disposes of (collectively “processes”) your personal data. Personal data is any information that does, or could, identify you. Your rights over your personal data are set out in **Section 9** **– Your Rights and Choices**.

This Privacy Notice applies to personal data collected by our websites, apps, and products (collectively “services”), and in the course of routine offline business contacts with you. The Notice is addressed primarily to our customers and service users; sales prospects; and individuals whose professional data is included in our services.

This Privacy Notice does not apply to services that have separate privacy notices. For instance, it does not apply to our [Publons](https://publons.com/about/terms) and [Techstreet](https://www.techstreet.com/pages/privacy_policy) services; our [MarkMonitor](https://www.markmonitor.com/legal/privacy-policy) business; or services for which we process your data only under instructions from our customers (for example, our ScholarOne and Converis services). This Notice does not apply to Clarivate employees and [candidates for employment](https://clarivate.com/clarivate-analytics-career-opportunities-privacy-notice/).

“Clarivate Analytics” includes all the businesses of the Clarivate group, including separate brands like CompuMark and Kopernio.

### 2\. Changes to this notice

We will update this Notice from time to time, and will communicate material changes to you before they become effective by the best means available to us (for example, by e-mail or via a prominent notice on our website and in our services).

### 3\. Personal data collected

We obtain your personal data in three different ways:

**(1) Data that you provide to us:**

We collect personal data directly from you, for example, the contact information and log-in credentials that we use to provide our services to you, and the professional profile details that you choose to enter into our products. Often this information is of the kind usually found on a business card. If you seek help with technical issues, you may share information about your devices with us, such as their operating system and installed programs.

**(2) Data about you that we obtain elsewhere:**

  * Clarivate provides information and analytics services to companies and universities. The services include Web of Science, Cortellis, CompuMark, and Derwent Innovation. If you are, for example, an academic author or researcher, a patent holder, or clinical trials investigator, your professional data may be included in these services. We collect this professional data from publicly available sources like academic publications, patent offices, and regulatory agencies. The data may include your name, work contact details, and specialization. If you have questions about this use of your data, contact us at [data.privacy@clarivate.com](mailto:data.privacy@clarivate.com).
  * We acquire marketing lists from third parties to identify prospects for our services (see **Section 9** **– Your Rights and Choices** for information on managing your marketing preferences).



**(3) Data that we collect via standard online technologies:**

Like most websites and web-based products, our services use standard technologies, like web server logs and cookies, to collect information about our visitors and end-users. You can read more about our use of these technologies in our [Cookie Notice](https://clarivate.com/legal/cookie-policy/). Some of our services allow you to register or log in via social media credentials. If you choose this option, the personal data that we collect will depend on the privacy settings of your social media account.

**Sensitive personal data**

We do not process personal data about race or ethnicity; political opinions, or religious or philosophical beliefs; trade union membership; or genetic, biometric, health, or sex-life information (“special categories of personal data” as defined by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation) unless you provide or indicate such information in a user-controlled area of our services, for example a professional profile. We may occasionally collect personal data subject to enhanced security requirements, such as requiring a credit card or government-issued ID to complete a transaction you have requested.

**Google invisible reCAPTCHA**

We sometimes use Google Invisible reCAPTCHA to secure our products and websites from abuse. Invisible reCAPTCHA collects hardware, software, and user interaction data from your device for risk analysis. reCAPTCHA data collection and use are governed by the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

**Third-party websites**

Our services may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites.

### 4\. Purposes of processing

We process personal data for the purposes listed below. Your relationship with Clarivate will determine which purposes apply to you.

**Customer and product administration**

To provide you with our services, we use personal data to create product accounts, provide user and technical support, enforce our terms of business, report product usage information to subscribers, report to our content and technology providers, contact you about renewal of your subscriptions, and other related administrative tasks.

**Personalized product functionality**

We use your personal data to deliver personalized functionality in our services, such as your saved searches or a professional profile that you maintain with us.

**Product development**

We analyze product usage data to inform our product development process, for example to understand which content and tools are most useful for our users. Your product usage information is usually aggregated or “pseudonymized” (delinked from you as an individual).

**Marketing**

We will send you marketing messages for Clarivate products that may interest you (see **Section 9  ** **– Your Rights and Choices** for information on managing your marketing preferences). We do not disclose your contact information to third parties for their marketing purposes.

**Product content**

We collect and organize publicly available professional data for inclusion in our services; for example, Web of Science contains information about academics obtained from articles published in scholarly journals.

**EU GDPR Article 6 (lawfulness of processing) information** ** **

For individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we process your personal data on the following legal bases:

**Purpose of processing** | **Legal basis of processing**  
---|---  
**Customer and product administration** | To fulfill our contractual obligations to you, or because we have a legitimate interest in, for example, providing our services to our customers’ organizations or enforcing our terms of business.  
**Personalized product functionality** | To fulfill our contractual obligations to you, or because we have a legitimate interest in providing the service functionalities required by our customers and users.  
**Product development** | Our legitimate interest in assessing and improving our services.  
**Marketing** | Either your consent or, if you are an existing customer, because we have a legitimate interest in keeping you advised of new services.  
**Product content** | Our legitimate interest in curating and distributing publicly available personal data of a professional and academic nature.  
  
### 5\. Recipients of the data

Your personal data will, depending on the purposes of processing, be disclosed to different individuals and organizations, including:

  * Clarivate employees and contractors whose roles require access to your data. Our personnel are bound to confidentiality terms which cover their obligations to protect personal data.
  * Clarivate suppliers who process personal data on our behalf (“processors”); for example Cloud computing providers and web analytics services like Google Analytics. Such vendors are contractually bound to protect your data to the same standard as set out in this Notice.
  * Subscribers to our services: This applies to the personal data of academics and other professionals that is collected from public sources for inclusion in our product databases and any personal data you choose to provide to us for display in our services (for example, in profiles and when using online forums).
  * Your data may be transferred to a third party as a result of any merger, acquisition, or similar corporate event involving Clarivate.
  * We will disclose your personal data when required to by law.



### 6\. Data security

Clarivate maintains appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect your personal data from accidental loss and unauthorized access or use. These measures include encryption, firewalls, roles-based data access, intrusion-detection software, and physical access controls to data centers. However, we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, unauthorized acquisition, or alteration of your data will never occur.

### 7\. Data retention

We store your personal data throughout the period of your relationship with us, and retain it for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying legal, accounting, or reporting obligations or to resolve disputes.  For more information on how long we store your data, please contact us at [data.privacy@clarivate.com](mailto:data.privacy@clarivate.com).

### 8\. International transfer

Clarivate is a global business, and your data will be transferred to countries with different privacy and data protection laws than your own, including to countries, such as the United States, that the European Commission considers not to have adequate data protection laws.

We protect our transfers from the European Economic Area with legal safeguards that include: (1) the existence of a European Commission adequacy decision (covering, for example, transfers to Canada, New Zealand, and Switzerland); (2) Clarivate’s Intra-Group Agreement incorporating [Standard Contractual Clauses](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en) approved by the European Commission; (3) Standard Contractual Clauses and other contract terms executed between Clarivate and a third-party data processor; (4) a third-party processor’s certification under the [EU-U.S. Privacy Shield](http://www.privacyshield.gov/).

### 9\. Your rights and choices

** ** You may at any time ask for access to the data that we hold about you, and request its correction or erasure, or that we cease to process it (see **Section 10 — Contact Us** ). For further information on European data protection rights, including your right to lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority, and your right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your data, visit our [European Data Protection Rights](https://clarivate.com/legal/european-data-protection-rights/) page.

**_Marketing_** : We would like to send you marketing communications, for example event invitations, white papers, and information about our services that may interest you. We will obtain your prior consent when your local law requires it.

You can opt out of our marketing communications at any time – all Clarivate marketing e-mails contain an “unsubscribe” link. If you have questions regarding our use of your information for marketing purposes, please contact the [Clarivate Marketing Team](mailto:news@clarivate.com).
