We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal information and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal information for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

### Where we store your personal information

All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers in the United Kingdom.

We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely, including taking the following safeguards:

  * **PCI DSS standards.** We never request or hold your credit card or debit card details. Where you need to make a payment to a finance company using your credit card, we use the secure WorldPay portal which is fully compliant with PCI DSS standards. Our systems do not record any of the information entered into this portal.
  * **Building entry controls & secure storage.** Our data is held at a Tier II data centre with secure access controlled via 24 hr security, biometric access, internal & external CCTV & security breach alarms. Our Central Support team operate in a building with secure access & alarmed entry controlled by allocated swipe card access internal & external CCTV, with visitors access logged via reception, & escorted entry once in the building.
  * **Secure lockable desks and cupboards.** Where documents containing personal information are in paper form for an interim period, they are stored in secure Desks and cupboards.
  * **Methods of disposal.** Paper documents are disposed of by shredding in a manner that ensures confidentiality.
  * **Firewalls and Encryption.** We use up-to-date and industry-standard firewall and encryption software technology.
  * **Overseas transfers.** Whenever we transfer your personal information outside the United Kingdom, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring that we apply appropriate safeguards (either by transferring data only to recipients in the European Union, to recipients in countries approved by the European Commission, to recipients that are party to the EU-US Privacy Shield, or by using specific contracts approved by the European Commission).



If you are concerned about the levels of data security in any of those countries, please let us know and we will endeavour to advise what steps will be taken to protect your data when stored overseas.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

### How long we will store your personal information

The length of time that we will store your data will depend on the ‘legal basis’ for why we are using that data, as follows:

Legal basis| Length of time  
---|---  
Where we use/store your data because it is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us | We will use/store your data for as long as it is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us  
Where we use/store your data because it is necessary for us to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject | We will use/store your data for as long as it is necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations  
Where we use/store your data because it is necessary for our legitimate business interests | We will use/store your data until you ask us to stop. However, if we can demonstrate the reason why we are using/storing your data overrides your interests, rights and freedoms, then we will continue to use and store your data for as long as it is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us (or, if earlier, we no longer have a legitimate interest in using/storing your data)  
Where we use/store your data because you have given us your specific, informed and unambiguous consent | We will use/store your data until you ask us to stop  
  
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitive of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
