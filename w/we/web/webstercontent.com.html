<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">WEBSTERCONTENT.COM PRIVACY POLICY</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">WebsterContent.com (also known as WebsterContent) operates various web sites.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WebsterContent has created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy and the protection of your personally identifiable information at the websites we operate (the "Website").&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">As part of our business, we collect and, in some instances, may disclose information about you - but only as set forth in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our personal information collection and use practices and the choices that you can make concerning the use of your personal information.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy also applies to individuals that have agreed to receive e-mail marketing from WebsterContent or one of our advertising partners, whether at the Website, via e-mail, on third-party websites or otherwise.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><b><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">Information Collected and Use of Your Information</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">For each visitor to the Website, our servers automatically recognize only the visitor's domain name, but not the e-mail address (unless requested and supplied by the visitor as a part of registration).</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">As part of our on-going efforts to ensure the best possible experience for all visitors to the Website, we collect data from browsers to aggregate statistical information.&nbsp; This includes the type of browser being used, its level of HTML support and what platform it is on.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy also applies to visitors to the Website that have agreed to receive e-mail marketing from web sites we operate but have not separately registered to become a member.&nbsp; The personal profile information that you submit to WebsterContent remains your property, but by submitting that information to WebsterContent and its partners you grant WebsterContent the right to use that information for marketing purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are a resident of the State of California and would like to opt-out from the disclosure of your personal information to any third party for marketing purposes, please visit our “Contact Us” page.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">When visitors elect to become members of one of our sites such as WebsterContent, we may request that they provide additional, personally identifiable information.&nbsp; This includes name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, age bracket, day and month of birth.&nbsp; All registrants may receive e-mail confirming their registration, and subsequent correspondence.&nbsp; If you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by using the unsubscribe option on the bottom of every email.&nbsp; Certain information, such as your e-mail address, is collected in order to, among other functions; verify your identity in the future within our database.&nbsp; When you select to receive information about offerings from a third party company during the registration process, we will share your personal information with that third party company to carry out your information request.&nbsp; WebsterContent may also use such information to directly market certain offers to you (via e-mail, direct mail and/or telemarketing), to monitor compliance with our Terms and Conditions and for content improvement and feedback purposes.&nbsp; We may sell the personal information that you supply to us and we may join together with other businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our members.&nbsp; These businesses may include, but are not limited to:&nbsp; (a) providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation; (b) e-mail marketers; and (c) telemarketers. </span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">We may also employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate information from customer lists, analyzing data, and providing marketing analysis.&nbsp; These agents have access to our members' personal information as needed to perform their functions for WebsterContent, but we do not permit them to use our members' personal information for other purposes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">WebsterContent reserves the right to release current or past member information in the event WebsterContent believes that the membership is being or has been used in violation of the Website's terms and conditions, or to commit unlawful acts, if the information is subpoenaed, if WebsterContent is sold or acquired, or when WebsterContent deems it necessary or appropriate.&nbsp; By agreeing to these conditions, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any third party, when WebsterContent, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail address with other third-parties for suppression purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time, and Federal Trade Commission enabling regulations.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">In addition, by registering at the Website, you agree that such act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR §310 et seq.), as amended from time to time (the "Rule").&nbsp; Notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed at the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the Rule.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">From time to time, we may receive personal information about you from outside sources and add it to your existing registration information on file at the Website. We do this to improve personalization of our services (for example, providing better newsletter content, advertising and/or special offers that we think may be of interest you).</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">We may also collect other information such as your IP address, domain names, access times and referring third party website addresses. WebsterContent uses this information for the operation of the Website, to maintain the quality of our offerings, and to provide general aggregate statistics regarding web sites we operate such as WebsterContent.&nbsp; Such information is not personally identifiable. </span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">We also collect information such as the identification of the server that your computer is logged onto and whether you opened an e-mail message delivered to you by WebsterContent.&nbsp; We also may compare our member list to various lists received from other third party companies, in an effort to avoid sending identical or similar e-mail messages to our members.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">When you obtain any product or service directly from WebsterContent or a web site we operate, we collect certain financial information, such as your credit card number, credit card expiration date and billing address.&nbsp; Financial information that you disclose to our company or web sites we operate is used to confirm your age and to bill you for shipping our products and services.&nbsp; To the extent that customer credit card-specific information is collected by our company or a web site we operate, said information will be kept in confidence and will not be shared with any third parties (other than consumer credit agencies) without your prior informed consent.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the foregoing, WebsterContent reserves the right to share with third parties the fact that we have credit card information on file for specific customers but we will not share the specific credit card information with third parties without your prior informed consent.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><b><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">Information Collection Processes</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">WebsterContent may employ "cookies" to help customize your access to the Website and for the delivery of targeted advertisements.&nbsp; A cookie is a piece of data stored on a your hard drive containing information about you.&nbsp; Cookies have many benefits to enhance your experience at our Website and to facilitate the receipt of targeted advertisements.&nbsp; For instance, by setting a cookie on our Website, a member would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our Website.&nbsp; Even in the case where a member rejects a cookie, they may still use our Website.&nbsp; The only drawback to this is that the member will be limited in what he/she can access in some areas on our Website, much like visitor-level access. </span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">We occasionally use cookies to anonymously track and target the interests of our members to further enhance the experience on our Website and for advertising, tracking and/or delivery purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp; To find out more about cookies, please visit www.cookiecentral.com.&nbsp; To disable and reject cookies, click here.&nbsp; At no time will we share cookie-related and/or data with third parties.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">In addition to cookies, our Website pages and/or e-mails may contain electronic images known as "pixel tags" (also knows as clear gifs) to track the pages that visitors and/or members visit at the Website for purposes of formatting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">Our Website may also contain pixel tags placed there by third parties to help determine the effectiveness of a joint promotional or advertising campaign. </span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><b><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">Security </span></b></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">WebsterContent has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of personal information under our control. Currently WebsterContent uses on some web sites we operate Secure Socket Layer Software (SSL) to protect data and secure any transactions. SSL encrypts information, including credit card numbers, names and addresses as they are transmitted over the Internet. Please be advised that, although we take every reasonable technological precaution available to protect your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. &nbsp;Therefore, WebsterContent cannot warrant that your information will be absolutely secure. Any transmission of data at or through our Website is at your own risk.&nbsp; However, access to your information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public.&nbsp; Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all WebsterContent user information.&nbsp; Employees not adhering to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action. </span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><b><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">Minors&nbsp; </span></b></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">Individuals under 18 years of age are not permitted to participate in obtaining products and/or services at WebsterContent or any web site we operate.&nbsp; No information should be submitted to, or posted at, any web site we operate by visitors under 18 years of age without the prior consent of their parent or guardian.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the foregoing, children 13 years of age and younger are not permitted to access any web site we operate for any reason and we do not knowingly collect personal information from such children.&nbsp; We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate and monitor the interactive activities of their children.</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><b><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">Third-Party Links</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">WebsterContent does not endorse, nor is WebsterContent responsible for the accuracy of, the privacy policies and/or terms and conditions of each of the advertisers and/or third parties accessible through the web sites operated by WebsterContent.&nbsp; The entities that advertise and/or place banner ads on web sites operated by WebsterContent are independent third parties and not typically affiliated with our company.</span></p>
