# Webkinz® - GENERAL PRIVACY POLICY

**Effective Date:** **May 27** **, 2009**

Ganz, an Ontario partnership, is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal information entrusted to us. 

**_What Is Personal Information?_**

This Privacy Policy is applicable to all users of the Ganz Websites, defined below, and all customers of Ganz who provide personal identifiable information ("PII"). When this Privacy Policy uses the term "PII", we mean information that identifies a particular individual, such as the individual's full name (first name and surname together), postal address, and email address.  When certain other information such as your favorite Webkinz pet, or other non-identifiable information is directly associated with PII, this other information also becomes PII for purposes of this Privacy Policy.  Some jurisdictions may call personally identifiable information "personal data" or "personally identifying information," and may include opinions about or related to a user within the definition of PII.  We sometimes refer to PII in this Privacy Policy as "personal information."

**_What Is the Scope of Our Privacy Policy?_**

This Privacy Policy addresses our policies and procedures relating to the personal information of individuals, such as our customers.  This Privacy Policy is intended to assist you in understanding Ganz's policies and procedures relating to our management of personal information and is applicable to Ganz, an Ontario partnership, its successors and assigns, and various websites operated by Ganz, including but not limited to webkinz.com, webkinzjr.com and ganzestore.com, each a " **Website."** This Privacy Policy is applicable to PII of all users of the Websites.  In addition, Ganz has a Children's Privacy Policy applicable to children who use Webkinz.com (and certain information provided by their parents and/or legal guardians) and incorporated into this document by reference below; if there is a conflict between the two documents, the Children's Privacy Policy supercedes this Privacy Policy with respect to those users. 

**_Compliance with EU Data Privacy Directive_**

Ganz complies with the EU Data Privacy Directive to the extent it applies to the information Ganz maintains.  This gives you certain rights in relation to the information which we hold about you.

When you provide us with your information, you acknowledge that the information will be stored and processed on servers located in Canada.

**_Personal and Other Information Collected by Ganz_**

Ganz may collect personal information that is voluntarily provided by you when you order a product, enter a promotion such as a sweepstakes or skill contest, answer our polls or surveys, register as a member on some of our Websites, sign up for additional services on our Websites, or communicate with us by mail, telephone or electronically. The type of information we collect and maintain may include your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, gender, date of birth, purchase history, credit card number, chat room communications, complaints you may have about our products or services, a record of promotions offered to you, your Ganz product preferences, such as favorite pets and themes. This type of information is collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the form of consent required by applicable law and its use is limited to the objectives for which it was collected as described in this Privacy Policy. 

We may collect information through technology (such as logging IP addresses) for routine system administration purposes, to make our Websites more interesting and useful to you, or to manage content delivery.  For instance, we use technology to track traffic patterns on the Website.  Once you have logged into a Website, we track your activities by using logs of database transactions and server interactions. This data may be used, for example, to maintain your pets' status on the webkinz.com Website.  We also use this information to understand which areas of our Websites are most appealing or least appealing or to deliver content that is specific to your country or area of residence. 

Ganz may also collect information that is stored in cookies, and we may associate this information with your personal information.  Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on our Websites. We use cookies for a number of reasons. Cookies allow you to store your password without having to constantly re-enter it. Cookies also help us to tailor messages that better match your needs and interests, and they allow us to better understand how users in general use our sites, which in turn helps us to focus our resources on features that are most popular with our users. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our sites may not work properly if you do. 

**_Consent_**

We reserve the right to collect, use and disclose your personal information without consent where required or permitted by law. 

Otherwise, personal information will be collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the form of consent required by applicable law and its use will be limited to the objectives for which it was collected as described herein.  The form of your consent can vary from implied consent to express consent, depending upon the circumstances and the sensitivity of the type of information collected.  We will rely on implied consent when we can reasonably conclude that you have given your consent by your action (e.g. by giving us your name and contact information so that we may send the eStore Items you have ordered) or inaction (e.g. by not exercising an ability to opt-out that is provided to you at the time your contact information is collected).  This Privacy Policy identifies the purposes for which your personal information is collected, used and disclosed.  Additional consent will be obtained from you should we wish to use or disclose your personal information for any additional purpose.

  2. **To Third Parties in the Event of Legal Reasons:   **We advise you that we may disclose personal information to the government or other legal or regulatory authorities (i) if so ordered by a court of law or (ii) for other legal reasons, such as (a) to comply with legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order; (b) to protect the company's rights and property; (c) to investigate reports of fraud or of users sending material using a false email address or users sending harassing, threatening, or abusive messages; (d) to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Website; or (e) in emergencies, such as when we believe someone's physical safety is at risk.  In some cases, disclosure may be required by law to be without notice to you.

In this event, Ganz would only provide such access under terms of a strict confidentiality agreement. Also, upon completion of the transaction or event, your personal information would be transferred to Ganz's successor-in-interest to be used for the purposes for which it was collected.

When registering on such Websites, we require that users submit their birth dates and no individual shall be permitted to join as a member if they indicate that they are under the age of 18 years.
