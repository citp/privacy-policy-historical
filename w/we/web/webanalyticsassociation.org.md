## WAA Privacy Policy

The Web Analytics Association (WAA) is dedicated to protecting your privacy when using our Web site. Please read this policy to understand how we collect and use information gathered through this Web site, and to understand your rights regarding these practices.

### PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTION & USAGE:

The WAA may collect personal information from our visitors on a voluntary basis. Personal information may include name, title, company, address, phone number and similar information which identify you. We collect this information so that you may obtain access to members-only portions of our Web site and/or to receive WAA products and services. We do not sell or rent personal information to other organizations. Where necessary, our site collects credit card information for the purpose of billing the user for requested services. Information collected through the Site may be shared with third parties that provide services on behalf of the site, such as credit card processors. Third parties may only use the data for the purpose for which it was provided.

However, some WAA events or services may be co-sponsored or provided in connection with other companies not under the direct control of the WAA. These include seminars, educational events, conferences, newsletters, discussion groups and similar services. Whenever we provide such services, we will disclose the name of our sponsor or provider, and will disclose any WAA information collection and use practices which may differ from those practices set forth in this policy. Co-sponsors of WAA services and events may require registration information from you which will be used by the co-sponsor or its partners to contact you regarding such services or events. When signing up or registering for any such services or events where the WAA is not the sole sponsor and provider, you should be aware of any differing privacy practices by our partners and read all disclosures available to you. Though the WAA makes reasonable efforts to only work with reputable partners, we cannot control their privacy practices in every instance regarding the personal information you voluntarily provide to them.

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information through the website. This can also be done by contacting us at:

### ANONYMOUS INFORMATION WE COLLECT

As you probably know, cookies are small pieces of information that many Web sites store on your computer's hard drive when you visit them. They don't tell us who you are unless you've specifically given us personally identifiable information. Cookies stored on your hard drive by our site are not accessible to other sites. Like many other web sites, our site uses cookies to improve your experience with our online content. For example, we may use a cookie to identify members so they don't have to re-enter a user id and password when they wish to download a utility or post to a discussion. As another example, cookies can be used to control the number of times you see advertisements, like pop-ups. By allowing us to better understand how users interact with the site over time, cookies also help us improve your experience and deliver more relevant content to you. Cookies may be created directly by our sites for these purposes, or by third-party companies operating on our behalf. However, our cookies do not contain any information that is, in itself, personally identifying. Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers. You need not have cookies turned on to visit our sites, though cookies may be required in order for you to participate in certain areas.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify security settings so you can approve or reject cookies on a case-by-case basis.

#### Pixel Tags

Like many web sites, we may also use pixel tags, also known as beacons, spotlight tags or web bugs, to improve our understanding of site traffic, visitor behavior, and response to promotional campaigns, as a supplement to our server logs and other methods of traffic and response measurement. Pixel tags are sometimes used in conjunction with small Javascript-based applications, also for the purpose of traffic measurement. We may also implement pixel tags provided by other companies, for the same purpose. You can disable pixel tags by changing your browser settings to omit images and disable Javascript; or there are commercial software packages available that can omit pixel tags and most advertisements.

#### CLICKSTREAM

No clickstream data collection is being used for this website at the current time. However, we have many vendors who are the industry leaders in this area as members in the WAA.

#### CHANGES TO POLICY; OPT-OUT PROCESS

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this policy at any time. Your continued use of our Web site following the posting of any changes to this policy means you accept such changes.

However, if at any time in the future we plan to use personal information in a way that differs from this policy, users will be notified by either 30 days notice displayed prominently on the website or by email. We will provide you the opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses.

By registering with the Web site, you consent to receive information and updates on our services directly from the WAA. You may opt-out of such communications by sending an email to insert WAA opt-out email address, by following unsubscribe procedures on the Web site or by following the unsubscribe instructions within each email.

#### COOKIES

At the current time, our site makes use of cookies to keep you logged in throughout your visit to the site.

#### OTHER WEB SITES:

Our Web site may contain links to other web sites not maintained by the WAA, including in connection with WAA co-sponsored events, publications, newsletters and other services. Other web sites may also reference or link to our Web site. Clicking a link on our Web site may bring you to a third party web site.

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Web site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that you visit. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other web sites.

#### SECURITY:

The security of your personal information is very important to us. We attempt to provide for the secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers by utilizing encryption software for purchases. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. Only those employees who need access to your information in order to perform their duties are allowed access to your personal information. However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and the WAA, and the WAA and you, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers and your use of the Web site demonstrates your assumption of this risk.

#### WEB SITE LEGAL DISCLAIMER:

Use of this Web site is governed by the provisions contained in the Legal Disclaimer. Your use, or access, of the Web site constitutes your agreement to be bound by these provisions. Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such an action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE THE WEB SITE.
