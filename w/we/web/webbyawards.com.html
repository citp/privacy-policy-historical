					<font color="#660000"><b>What information do we collect? How do we use it?</b></font>
					</p><p>
					<a name="call"></a><b>Call For Entries:</b><br>
					When you submit a site(s), we need to know your name, email address, phone number, mailing 
					address, tax id number, URL, company, title, age, gender, education, credit card number, expiration date and a few details on your Web site's functionality and content. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you if you are nominated as well as to learn more about the demographics of our nominees.
					</p><p>
					<a name="011"></a><b>The O11 and Press Updates:</b><br>
					When you sign up for The 011 or Press Updates we collect only an email address to deliver the requested information.				
					</p><p>
					<a name="voting"></a><b>Voting for The People's Voice Awards:</b><br>
					When you register to vote for <a href="http://www.webbyawards.com/peoplesvoice/ ">The People's Voice
					Awards</a> we collect an email address and user-created password to 
					establish a unique identifier for each voter. This lets us provide maximum security against "ballot 
					stuffing" and helps us notify voters with information pertaining to The People's Voice Awards.  We will 
					also use your email address to send you a reminder email to participate in the Webby Awards the 
					following year if you registered for the People's Voice in the previous year.  If you do not wish to 
					receive this reminder, you may email <a href="mailto:techsupport@webbyawards.com">techsupport@webbyawards.com</a> and ask to be taken off the 
					mailing list.
					</p><p>
					<a name="surveys"></a><b>Surveys: </b><br>
					We will also request demographic information, such as age, gender and years online, in the
					Rate and Win survey if you choose to participate .  The information collected on the Rate
					and Win survey completed during either the People's Voice registration or voting process
					goes directly to NetRaker, a third-party market research company.  They use this information
					to conduct market research and not for any other purpose.
					When you go to rate a site, you will be asked to provide age, gender, modem speed and years
					of internet experience.
					</p><p>
					
					
					<a name="kit"></a><b>Press Kit: </b><br>
					When you order a press kit we collect a name, email address, phone number, mailing address,
					title, company, assigning media outlet, nature of request and deadline.  This enables us to
					contact you and process your request.
					</p><p>
					<a name="sponsor"></a><b>Sponsor Information Form:</b><br>
					When you submit a request for sponsorship information, we collect a name, email address, phone number, mailing address,
					title and company.  This enables us to
					contact you and process your request.
					</p><p>
					<a name="webcast"></a><b>Webcast Postcards:</b><br>
					When you request a postcard to be sent to your friend, we ask you for your
					name, email address and your friend's name and email address.  We do not use this
					information for any other purpose than to send your friend the postcard. </p><p></p>
					
					<a name="contests"></a><b>Contests and Promotional Features:</b><br>
					When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address,
					and email address so we can administer the contest and notify winners. In some cases we
					offer you the opportunity to receive information about new services, special offers and
					other news that you might find valuable. To receive such notifications you must opt-in to

					<a href="http://www.webbyawards.com">www.webbyawards.com</a> uses cookies on this site to

					is generated by a software application on a site's server.  This cookie enables the site's
					server to only show you the Audi Sweepstakes winner the first time you visit the site. We

					will also place a temporary session cookie on your computer when you complete a survey of a
					Web site through our "Rate the nominees" functionality.   We also collect non-personally
