			</ul>

			<p>The Webby Awards and The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences are committed to protecting your privacy. We understand that the information we collect about you is your information, and we intend to keep it that way.</p>

			<h3>What information do we collect? How do we use it?</h3>
			<p>We collect information from you in the following places on our Web site for several different services and site functions outlined below:</p>
			
			<ul id="one">
				<li><a href="#one-one">Call for Entries</a></li>
				<li><a href="#one-two">The 011 (our newsletter)</a></li>
				<li><a href="#one-three">Voting for The People's Voice Awards</a></li>
				<li><a href="#one-four">Tell a Friend Notifications</a></li>
			
				<li><a href="#one-five">Contests and Promotional Features</a></li>
				<li><a href="#one-six">Technical Information</a></li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4 id="one-one">Call For Entries</h4>
			<p>When you submit a site(s), we need to know your name, email address, phone number, mailing address, <acronym title="Universal Resource Locator">URL</acronym>, company, title, client (if applicable) and credit card information (if applicable). This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you if you are honored for an award.</p>
			
			<h4 id="one-two">The O11</h4>
			<p>When you sign up for The 011, we collect only an email address to deliver the requested information.</p>
			
			<h4 id="one-three">Voting for The People's Voice Awards</h4>
			<p>When you register to vote for The People's Voice Awards we collect a name, an email address and some additional information like age, gender, schooling, salary and industry to establish a unique identifier for each voter.</p>
			<p>WE DO NOT USE THIS INFORMATION FOR MARKETING PURPOSES. This lets us provide maximum security against "ballot stuffing" and helps us notify voters with information pertaining to The People's Voice Awards.</p>
			<p>We will also use your email address to send you a reminder email to participate in the Webby Awards each year.</p> 
			<p>You will also have the opportunity to opt-in to receive occasional information from our partners.  If you wish to stop receiving this information, you may unsubscribe from the link at the bottom of the email from our partner, or email <a href="mailto:jcollins@webbyawards.com">jcollins@webbyawards.com</a> and ask to be taken off the mailing list.</p>
			
			<h4 id="one-four">Tell a Friend Notifications</h4>
			<p>When you request a notification to be sent to your friend, we ask you for your name, email address and your friend's name and email address. We do not use this information for any other purpose than to send your friend notifications about the Webby Awards.</p>
			
			<h4 id="one-five">Contests and Promotional Features</h4>
			<p>When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address, and email address so we can administer the contest and notify winners. In some cases we offer you the opportunity to receive information about new services, special offers and other news that you might find valuable. To receive such notifications you must opt-in to the distribution list. If at any time you choose to opt-out of receiving such notifications you may do so by sending your request to: <a href="mailto:jcollins@webbyawards.com">jcollins@webbyawards.com</a>.</p>
			
			<h4 id="one-six">Technical Information</h4>
			<p>We also collect the following technical information about you when you visit our Web site: modem speed, login id, password, the prior Web site you visited, the following Web site you visit, the time you spend browsing the site, the number of banner advertisements you click, keyword searches you conduct, your IP (Internet Protocol) address, your browser type, your operating system, your computer type, your Internet service provider and time stamps.</p>
			<p>We may use this personal information to improve our services to you and to customize your browsing experience. Because www.webbyawards.com merely links to — and does not publish — content supplied by third parties or generally available on the Internet, www.webbyawards.com is not responsible for information collected by these third parties, or for any information gathered by third party advertising companies through the use of banner ads. We recommend that you read the privacy policy of other sites you may link to from our site.</p>
			 
			<h3 id="two">How can you edit your personal information?</h3>
			<p>You may change your personal information at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:jcollins@webbyawards.com">jcollins@webbyawards.com</a> and describing the changes you would like to make.</p>

			<h3 id="three">How does The Webby Awards protect customer information?</h3>
			<p>When you place orders or access account information we provide a secure server with secure server software (<acronym title="Secure Sockets Layer">SSL</acronym>) that encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access.</p>
			
			<h3 id="four">What about "cookies"?</h3>
			
			<p>A cookie — a small text file placed on a user's hard drive — is generated by a software application on a site's server. We use temporary session cookies to assign to you and store a SessionID on all secure pages, including in the voting system for The People's Voice Awards to enable you to vote during multiple sessions. These cookies allow you to move uninterrupted between areas of our secure site. This SessionID is not personally identifiable to you and this type of cookie does not leave any retrievable information on your hard drive. We also use a third party service provider to collect non-personally identifiable <acronym title="Internet Protocol">IP</acronym> addresses and entry-point and search form information to monitor the number of visitors to the site and the usage of our site. This is done through the use of both permanent and session cookies.</p>
			
			<p>We use a session cookie on our site to determine whether or not you are accepting cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser to prevent that. Even without a cookie, you can still use most of the features on our site, but you cannot vote for The People's Voice or enter your site for a Webby Award.</p>
			<p>Our search engine is hosted and provided by Atomz.com. They do not collect any personal information from you when you use the search function.</p>
			
			<h3 id="five">People's Voice Voting</h3>
			
			<h4>Reviews</h4>
			<p>Please note that as part of the People's Voice Voting, users will be able to write reviews directly relating to the nominated websites only. To change any aspect of your review, or to report a review that you feel is inappropriate, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:jcollins@webbyawards.com">jcollins@webbyawards.com</a>.</p>
			
			<h4>Voting</h4>
			<p>People's Voice Voting is open to all Internet users. To vote, you must register at least your email address and name. Once registration is complete, you will be sent a confirmation email with your login password. You are able to submit only one vote in each category.</p>
			
			<h4>Changing Votes</h4>
			<p>You are not able to change your vote in any category once you have submitted your vote.</p>
			
			<h4>Voting Confirmation</h4>
			<p>To review and confirm your votes in People's Voice, please review the "Ballot Scorecard" page once you have registered. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:jcollins@webbyawards.com">jcollins@webbyawards.com</a> if you have any questions regarding your votes.</p>
			<p></p>
			
			<h3 id="six">Will the Webby Awards disclose the information it collects to outside parties?</h3>
			
			<p>The Webby Awards does not sell or share your personal information to others. If you submit a site in our Call for Entries, we do allow our partners to provide you with news and special offers.  However, we do not share your personal information with our partners and maintain control of your information at all times. If at any time you choose not to receive such notifications you may do so by sending your request to: <a href="mailto:jcollins@webbyawards.com">jcollins@webbyawards.com</a> or simply unsubscribe from the link at the bottom of the email.</p> 
			<p>The Webby Awards may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.</p>
			
			<h3 class="seven">Your consent</h3>
