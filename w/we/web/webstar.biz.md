Data protection declaration
Preamble

the webstar site. We therefore assign great importance to data protection. The collection, processing
(including saving, changing, transferring, blocking and deletion) and use of your data is subject to the
prevailing data protection regulations.
   Hereafter we would like to briefly describe the principles on the basis of which your data is used:
1. Data collection and storage
   Within the scope of registering with webstar, WellStar collects and stores personal data about the
respective member and processes this i.e. uses this data for substantiating, carrying out and settling the
user relationship (hereinafter known as „registration data“). Personal data are individual details about the
personal or factual circumstances of a certain or identifiable person, such as, for instance, their first name,
surname, address, phone number, date of birth or e-mail address. The date of birth is primarily needed to
ensure that the member using webstar is at least 18 years of age.
   In order to be able to process and execute orders in the WellStar shop, WellStar also collects and
saves additional personal data such as the delivery address and details on the preferred mode of payment
(hereinafter generally referred to as ”ordering data”).
   For the purpose of creating their own profile on WellStar and presenting themselves on the portal,
members can, in addition to their registration data, provide further data and content about themselves. All
data and content which you provide to create your profile shall hereinafter be referred to as “profile data”.
   By using webstar, other data is collected about you, such as your body weight and size (hereinafter
referred to as “vitality data“). These details are provided voluntarily and serve to calculate your vitality
index, for example. Details you provide in your diary (dietary plans, fitness plans) help you to stick to a
disciplined routine and to calculate your vitality index. Responding to questions about your state of health
will help us to calculate your vitality index.


                                                                                     Data protection declaration
2. Publication
   WellStar makes your profile data partly or wholly visible to other webstar members within the members‘

   Furthermore, other members can view data that you have published on other members’ profile pages
e.g. pinwall entries. These entries can be viewed by members you are connected with in the community,
on whose page you have placed an entry. Further provisions apply for members who are also sales
partners of WellStar. These can be found in the Declaration of Privacy for sales partners.
   It is possible to search for other members on webstar. Webstar members cannot be found on external
search engines such as Google. Not having a login or password, robots/crawlers used by search engines
cannot gain access to webstar, i.e. profile data is not displayed in external search engines. We cannot,
however, provide a guarantee for this.


                                                                                     Data protection declaration
3. Data transfer
   WellStar shall not pass on data for promotional or other purposes to third parties, unless this has
explicitly been stated in the Declaration of Privacy.
   Your registration, profile and vitality data are passed on to your personal vitality coach. Your coach is
obliged to treat the data they receive confidentially and to use it exclusively to provide vitality advice, and
to fulfil their contractual obligations.
   Your vitality coach is also automatically classed as your friend in the webstar community and can be
“downgraded” by you to an acquaintance.
   Within the scope of directly ordering goods from WellStar in the WellStar shop, it may also be necessary
to pass on your ordering data to the companies in charge of production and the delivery of goods, as well
as the bank responsible for the settlement of payments. They too are obliged to treat all data they receive
confidentially and to use it exclusively to fulfil their contractual obligations.
   WellStar enters into cooperation agreements with external providers, known as shop partners. These
shop partners are given personalised shops on the webstar sites. If you choose to make use of the offers
of shop partners, your ordering data will be passed on to the corresponding shop partners. Detailed
information on credit cards and account numbers will be collected directly by the respective shop partner
and hence not be conveyed by WellStar. The shop partners are also obliged to treat all data they receive
confidentially and exclusively for the purpose of executing their contractual obligations.
   In order to be able to provide an attractive range of products from our shop partners, our shop partners
regularly inform WellStar about which products you have purchased from the respective shop partner and
the amount you have spent.
   Furthermore, WellStar will only disclose your data to third parties in cases where there is a legal
obligation to do so. By using webstar, you agree to data about you being collected, processed and used by
WellStar in the aforementioned manner and for the aforementioned purpose.
4. Newsletters
   WellStar automatically sends newsletters by e-mail to remind you of your plans (e.g. fitness plans or
dietary plans). At your explicit request, you will receive a regular newsletter by e-mail with information
about new developments and current offers by webstar and WellStar.
