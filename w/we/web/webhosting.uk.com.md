# Web Hosting UK - Privacy Policy - Data Security - Dedicated Server - VPS Hosting

**Information Collected** :

1\. At the time of sign-up, we ask you to provide us with your exact postal address, telephone number & fax number. We use this information to contact you after the sign-up & confirm the web hosting order received on your account. This is a part of our fraud-prevention process wherein we call customers & check for the legitimacy of the order received. These details are also required to be put in when we register a domain name for you or while placing a transfer request for a domain name under your name. The whois information for your domain also shows the same details which you filled in when signing up with us (unless stated otherwise). Providing a mailing (postal) address while registering domains is mandatory . 

2\. We ask you to provide us with your email address. This is done to remain in contact with you at all times. All our invoices, support ticket replies & other communications are all done through emails. This email address is to be used when requesting for any service which requires the user to be authenticated. We also send you emails informing about the upgradation in services, networks & other information which we deem to be necessary to be sent to our clients. This also is the same email address which is used as the admin contact email address while registering or transferring your domain name. 

3\. We also use web cookies. These cookies are parcels of text sent by a server to a web browser and then sent back unchanged by the browser each time it accesses that server. These are also used for authenticating, tracking, and maintaining specific information about users, such as site preferences, browser preferences & general web browsing behaviour. These also help us to identify you as our customer. However if you change your browser settings, these would be of no use at all. 

**Data Safeguarding**

1\. We do not provide the information collected from our customers to any external source under any circumstances. However, being a reputed hosting company servicing thousands of clients, WebHosting UK has some social responsibilities also to take care of. As & when a government authorized law-keeping agency or a goverment department approaches us to seek information about a client, we have to lend our help. It is our responsibility as a law abiding company. 

2\. Your data is accessible only to the staff of WebHosting UK & the management. Nobody else is privy to the same. We have physical as well as electronic processes to secure the information we have for you. There also exist managerial procedures which have to be fulfilled to be able to access your contact information collected.

3\. Everytime we have to make a change or remove the information we have for you, all the required steps are taken to establish your identity as the account holder before proceeding ahead. 

4\. We use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption to ensure security of the information we have for you. We also impart necessary training to our personnel who have access to the databases with your information to guarantee appropriate handling of data.

You are welcome to inform us in case you think this privacy policy has been violated. You may email us at feedback@webhosting.uk.com. Appropriate remedial action will be taken in 24 hours time.
