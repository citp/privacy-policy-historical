The Personal Data that Webinterpret collects from you and that you provide to Webinterpret is

Your Personal Data may also be transferred to any third parties as described in the previous
section, but such transfers will only be made on the basis of the adequacy decision issued by the
European Commission pursuant to article 45 of GDPR (should the service providers or their
technical providers be located outside the EEA area). Some of these third parties to whom your
Personal Data will be shared are located outside of the European Economic Area, in countries
where data protection laws may not be as extensive as those which apply to us. For the sellers
with their seats in the People’s Republic of China, their personal may be transferred to our Chinese
entity (Webinterpret China).
The entities mentioned above that together with us provide the services to you are joint personal
data controllers (together with us). Our agreement with those entities establishes mutual
obligations of all the parties to protect your rights and it stipulates as follows:
     •  Each party is a joint data controller and each party is responsible for the protection of your
        personal data in the context of rendering its services;
     •  Neither party has a right to represent the other party in the context of personal data;
     •  Each party is obliged to provide you with information requested under the Article 13 of the
        GDPR;
     •  You have the right to submit to any of the parties a request to provide information on
        personal data processing, rectify your data, restrict processing or erasure of your data, as
        well as the right to data portability and right to withdraw your consent provided to process
        your data by either of the party; a party that receives such request is obliged to pass the
        information to other join controllers.
If we transfer your Personal Data to countries outside of the European Economic Area, we will
ensure that we do this in accordance with the EU data protection regulations (in particular the
GDPR) and with due respect for the rights and freedoms of individuals whose Personal data are
processed. We will do this with a view to ensure the level of protection which applies to your
Personal Data processed in these countries is similar to that which applies within the European
Economic Area.

else, unless this was due to our negligence.
Despite our efforts regarding security it is important to bear in mind that the Internet is not a secure
means of communication. Personal Data communicated through the Internet may be intercepted
by other people. We cannot guarantee the security of Personal Data sent to us through this Site.
You accept that you use this Site at your own risk.
