The types of personal information collected may vary depending on the activity.</p>

<h3>Use of Collected Personal Information</h3>

<p>If you use any community features inlcuding, but not limited to, online forums, creating user "profiles", chat and messaging, please remember that any information disclosed in these venues may be automatically made public. You should exercise caution when disclosing any personal information in these areas. However, you may choose to have your profile page public or private. In the case where you chose to make your profile page private, the information there will only be visible to you. We may combine the information you submit to us with information collected in other forums, such as through emails or offline, or with publically available information or information obtained from third parties.</p>

You can disable cookies at any time, although you may not be able to access or use features of the Service.</p>

<h3>Other Information</h3>
<p>We use passive tracking technologies to log non-identifiable information such as IP address, browser type and site usage (for example: what pages are accessed, how often, referring/exit pages and URLs) to monitor and analyze use of our services, for their technical administration, to increase their functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor them to our users’ needs. We also use this information to verify that users of our services meet the criteria required to process their requests.

<h3>SECURITY OF PROVIDED INFORMATION</h3>
<p>WeBuzz is very concerned with safeguarding your information provided. We have put in place reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. Please be aware, however, data transmission over the Internet is not 100% secure from intrusion, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure protection of your information or use your personal information for improper purposes. Also please note that email and messaging systems are not considered secure, so we discourage you from sending us personal information through these mediums.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you use a password on WeBuzz Website, you are responsible for keeping it confidential. You are remineded not to share the password with any other person. If you believe your password has been misused, please inform us immediately.</p>

<p>Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on computers located outside your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside Hong Kong and choose to provide information to us, WeBuzz transfers your personal information to Hong Kong and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>

<h3>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</h3>
<p>As part of our regular business conduct, we may share information with companies or individuals, but not including advertisers, providing services or acting on our behalf, such as companies providing technological or fulfillment services. These third parties have access to your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. While we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as WeBuzz, we will take all reasonable precautions under the circumstances to ensure the protection of your personal information.</p>
<p>We will disclose any information about you to the government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe it is necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal processes, to protect the property and rights of WeBuzz or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any persons, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity. In the event that there is a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or bankruptcy, WeBuzz may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of our assets, including the information you have submitted.</p>

<h3>UPDATING AND ACCESSING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>At any time, you are invited to review, update, correct or delete personally identifiable information in your profile by changing the applicable information in your account settings or, for services hosted on a social networking site, by changing the applicable information in your profile page. If you completely delete all this information, your account may become deactivated. If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your request if we are not legally obligated to retain the record.</p>

<h3>OPT-OUT</h3>
<p>You may "opt out" of receiving any marketing and promotional emails from us at any time by selecting the opt-out mechanism contained in an email message or any newsletter or editing your account preferences. We treat each of our consumer offerings individually, so if you are receiving mailings from more than one area of our website, and if you want to unsubscribe, you must do so with respect to each such area individually.</p>

<h3>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</h3>
<p>From time to time, we may include links to other websites as a service to you. If you choose to visit an advertiser by clicking on a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. Please note that we do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to review the privacy practices of the other websites that you visit, as we are not responsible for their privacy practices and cannot control their use of data.</p>

<h3>"PHISHING"</h3>
<p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to WeBuzz. Therefore, we work on safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft with respect to information in our possession. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website.</p>

<h3>ONLINE SECURITY</h3>
<p>The online transaction processing is provided by PayDollar using the highest commercially available encryption technology - Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificate encryption. All confidential information is automatically encrypted before it is transmitted, to protect the data from being read and interpreted.</p>

<h3>OUR POLICY FOR CHILDREN UNDER 13</h3>
<p>We respect the privacy of parents and children and the service and applications is not geared toward children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13, you may use and access our websites only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. If WeBuzz discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided WeBuzz with personally identifiable information, WeBuzz will immediately delete that child’s personally identifiable information from the website. </p>

<h3>AGREEMENT WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<p>By using any WeBuzz websites, applications or services, you signify your understanding of an agreement with this Privacy Policy, and to our Terms of Use. If you do not agree with our privacy practices, it may be best to limit your level of interaction with our sites, which could include simply not providing us with personal information.</p>

<h3>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<p>As noted above, we may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last modified" date at the bottom of this page. Such revisions shall be effective to you immediately upon posting. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to be informed of how we aim to protect your information.</p>
