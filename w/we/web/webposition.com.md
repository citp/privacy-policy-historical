Please note that this policy only applies to our data collection and use practices for the Site and does not apply to the data collection and use practices of other companies or organizations whose products, services or Web sites you may use or gain access to through the Site.

**Types of Information We Collect and Use**

In general, when we request personal information from you, we will inform you of the type of information we need and the purpose of our use. Except as specifically described in this Privacy Policy, we will only use your personal information for the purpose it was collected.



**Cookies**

When you visit the Site, one or more cookies, web beacons or action tags may be sent to your computer or otherwise used in connection with your visit or use. A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your computer when you visit a Web site or use a service. When stored on your computer, a cookie uniquely identifies your browser and records your preferences and other data about your visit or use. Cookies are also sometimes used to complete transactions requested by users. Web beacons, also known as web bugs, are small, graphic images that transparently reside on a Web site or other web-based service and are designed to allow the Web site or service owner to monitor who is visiting the Web site or using the service. Action tags assist in delivering cookies and embed a random identifying number on a user's browser. We use information collected from cookies and web beacons to track which pages our users view, which browsers they use and other information about user activity when visiting the Site or using our products and services. We may also use cookies to help us provide you with personalized features and preferences in a manner that is linked to personal user information you elect to share with us. We use action tags to compile statistics and other data about our users on an aggregate basis. 

We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. For a session cookie, once you close your browser the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie stays stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can change the settings on your browser to refuse or notify you prior to accepting cookies and to remove them from your computer. However, some features, products and services may not function properly without cookies. 

We may engage third party advertisement networks that may place cookies on computers accessing and using the Site that collect non-personal information regarding the content accessed by the computer on the Site. This information may be used by InfoSpace and its third party advertising network partners to identify and target related advertising to the user of such computer, when on Web sites within the third party’s advertising network of sites. Some of these third party advertising networks may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and subject to the NAI Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Preference Marketing by Network Advertisers, available at www.networkadvertising.org (the "NAI Principles"). If you would like to opt-out from these services, you may go to the NAI Non-PII Opt-Out Page, located at http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp, or the opt-out page of the particular third party advertising network identified in the cookie.

In some instances we rely on channel partners and third party vendors to fulfill transactions, product trials and information requests, and provide customers and prospective customers with information about our products and services. To do this, such channel partners or third party vendors may collect or we may transfer to them your information solely for that purpose, in which case they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 
  * Third Party Service Providers. Occasionally, we engage third parties to provide us with certain products and services, such as support, consulting, statistical analysis and marketing research, packaging, mailing and delivering items, sending postal mail, providing technical support, and processing event registrations that may require access to or use of your personal information. In such event, the third party will be obligated to maintain the privacy of any personal information disclosed or shared as part of its provision to us of the product to service and to only use such information for the limited purpose of providing the product or service. 
  * Business Transfers. Information about our users and the access and use of the Site and our products and services is one of our most important business assets. As such, information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed and transferred as part of any merger or acquisition, creation of a separate business to provide products and services, the sale or pledge of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets.
  * Protection of InfoSpace; Compliance with Law. We will disclose personal information or remove, destroy or alter personal information in our possession or control when we believe it is necessary to comply with legal process, respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of our company, its employees, customers or the public.

However, you may not be able to access or use some features of the Site and some of our other products and services if you chose not to provide us with the information required for those products and services.

**Special Notification with respect to Children's Privacy (Users under the Age of 13)**

In response to concerns about protecting children's privacy online, Congress enacted the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which sets forth rules and procedures governing the ways in which Web sites may collect, use and disclose any personal information for children under the age of 13. In accordance with InfoSpace policy and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT: 

  * Request or knowingly collect personally identifiable information online or offline contact information from users under 13 years of age; or
  * Knowingly use or share personal information from users under 13 years of age with third parties; It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information given to us or pertaining to children under 13.
