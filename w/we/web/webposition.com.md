# Privacy Policy

WebPosition is a part of WebTrends Inc. ("WebTrends") and we are committed to maintaining the trust and confidence of its customers and visitors to our web site. In particular, we want you to know that WebTrends is not in the business or selling, renting or trading email lists with other companies for marketing purposes. In this Privacy Policy we provide detailed information on when and why we collect your personal information, how we use it, the limited conditions under which we may disclose it to others and how we keep it secure. 

**Collection and Use of Personal Information**

Personal information means any information that may be used to identify you, such as, your name, title, phone number, email address, or mailing address. 

In general, you can browse our web site without giving us any personal information. We use our own product, WebTrends On Demand, to analyze traffic to this web site in order to understand our customer's and visitor's needs and to continually improve our site for them. WebTrends On Demand collects only anonymous, aggregate statistics. For example, we do not tie a specific visit to a specific IP address. For more information, see [Privacy Statement for Visitors to Sites Tracked by WebTrends On Demand](https://ondemand.webtrends.com/privacypolicy.asp#PSFV). 

If you want to subscribe to our MarketPosition newsletter, we ask you to simply provide your business email address. In that case, we use your email address only in connection with providing you the newsletter and for no other purpose. 

Additional activities on our site require you to be registered—for example, to download a trial. As part of the registration process, we collect additional personal information. We use that information for several general purposes: to tell you about products, seminars and services if you so request; to fulfill your request; to contact you if we need to obtain or provide additional information; to verify the accuracy of our records; to contact you regarding customer satisfaction surveys. Some activities require additional personal information. For example, to fulfill online orders for product and support, we require you to enter credit card information, and you have the option to provide a separate shipping address. 

**Disclosure of Personal Information**

In some instances we rely on our channel partners to fulfill product trials and information requests, and provide customers and prospective customers with information about WebTrends and its solutions. To do this, we may pass your information to them for that purpose only, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. WebTrends sometimes hires vendor companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering items, sending postal mail, providing technical support, and processing event registrations. We provide those companies only the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 

Because WebTrends is a global company, your personal information may be shared with other WebTrends offices or subsidiaries in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere. The data protection laws in these countries may be more or less extensive than laws in the country in which you are located. However, WebTrends and its offices and subsidiaries are governed by this Privacy Policy and will use your personal information only as set forth in this policy. 

By using our web site and providing us with your personal data, you consent to this transfer of your personal data. 

WebTrends may also disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange or other disposition (whether of assets, stock or otherwise) of all or a portion of a business of WebTrends and/or its subsidiaries or to (1) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on WebTrends or this web site; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of WebTrends and this web site; (3) enforce its agreements with you, or (4) act in urgent circumstances to protect personal safety or the public. 

**Children and Privacy**

Our web site does not offer information intended to attract children. WebTrends does not knowingly solicit personal information from children under the age of 13. 

**Security of Personal Information**

When you submit credit card, email and physical address information to us, we use a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) helps protect your information as it travels over the Internet by encrypting that information before it is sent to us. We have also implemented industry-standard security mechanisms and procedures to protect data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. 

**Use of Cookies**

A cookie is a small text file containing information that a web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes and allows us to analyze our site traffic patterns. A cookie can not give us access to your computer or to information beyond what you provide to us. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies; consult your browser's manual or online help if you want information on restricting or disabling the browser's handling of cookies. If you disable cookies, you can still view the publicly available information on our web site. If are using a shared computer and you have cookies turned on, be sure to log off when you finish. 

**Links to Other Web Sites**

Our web site contains links to information on other web sites. On web sites we do not control, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information that you provide while visiting those sites. Those sites are not governed by this Privacy Policy, and if you have questions about how a site uses your information, consult that site's privacy statement. 

**Access to Your Personal Information**

You are entitled to access the personal information that we hold. Email your request to [privacy@WebTrends.com](mailto:privacy@WebTrends.com). An administrative fee may be payable. 

Updating Your Personal Information 

You may update your information at anytime by sending an email to [help@webposition.com](mailto:help@webposition.com). 

**Unsubscribing**

You may unsubscribe to general mailings at any time, by sending an email to [remove@webposition.com](mailto:remove@webposition.com). You may unsubscribe to the MarketPosition newsletter at any time, at <http://marketposition.com/nlsubscribe.htm>

**Your Consent**

By using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of the information you provide to us as outlined in this Privacy Policy. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time and without notice. If we change our Privacy Policy, we will publish those changes on this page.
