Please note that this policy only applies to our data collection and use practices for the Sites and does not apply to the data collection and use practices of other companies or organizations whose products, services or Web sites you may use or gain access to through the Sites.

Types of Information We Collect and Use

In general, you can browse the Sites without providing us any personal information. Ordering products or services, requesting support and other activities on the Sites may require you to be registered or provide us with some personal information – for example, to participate in a trial of the software or services we make available on the Sites, or to post a comment.

The information we collect about you generally falls into the following categories: Personally Identifiable Information (“Personal Information”) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Anonymous Information”).  


Personal Information refers to information that identifies or can be used to identify the person to whom the information relates, for example your name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail address, employer and job title.  


Anonymous Information refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual.

If you purchase Services on the Sites, we collect information such as your name, email address, and other demographic information (such as age, gender, occupation and household income). In addition, our secure third party payment processing provider collects credit card and other billing information.

Billing is accomplished through the use of a secure and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards compliant third party billing services, securing your sensitive financial and billing information.

We may also combine this information with other generally or publicly available information to help us identify visitors’ preferences or interests. We may provide information that identifies you to companies that assist us in these activities, such as helping to fulfill your request for a product, service or information. In addition, we collect information about keywords for search engine optimization efforts. These keywords are collected and stored for you, for your own analytical purposes.

When you visit our Sites, our servers record the information that your browser automatically sends whenever visiting a Web site, including your Web request, the Internet Protocol address and browser configuration of your computer, the date and time of your request, the Uniform Resource Locator of the referring and exiting Web sites, and we place one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We generally collect this Anonymous Information in server log files and use this information for a variety of purposes, including the administration and operation of our Web sites and other properties, identifying and preventing fraud and misuse of our Web sites, designing and developing new products and services and improving the overall quality of your experience.

Cookies

We may automatically collect certain information through the use of “cookies” or clear gifs. Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user’s hard drive at the request of a Web site to enable the Sites to recognize users who have previously visited them and retain certain information such as customer preferences and history. Clear gifs (also known as web bugs or web beacons) are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Sites or in emails relating to the Sites to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Sites. If we combine cookies with or link them to any personally identifiable information, we treat this information as Personal Information.

We use information collected from cookies and clear gifs to track the pages our users view, the browsers they use and other information about user activity when visiting the Sites or using our Services. We may also use cookies to help us provide you with personalized features and preferences in a manner that is linked to personal user information that you voluntarily share with us. We use action tags to compile statistics and other data about our users on an aggregate basis.

We may also use third parties to serve ads on the Sites. These third parties may place cookies, clear gifs or other devices on your computer to collect Anonymous Information, and information provided by these devices may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Sites and the other sites tracked by these third parties. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies in third party ads.

Please keep in mind that if you voluntarily post information or comments in public areas of the Sites, that information can be viewed and possibly used by others. Do not disclose contact information, including phone number, email address, street address or any other information that you do not wish to share. We may edit information that you post to public areas for formatting, size, and/or content. We may also highlight content that you post to the public areas by featuring your content in a prominent location.
