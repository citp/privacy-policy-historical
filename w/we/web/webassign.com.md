An instructor or other administrative user using the Services may upload student information including the student’s full name, username, initial password, student number (optional), and e-mail address (optional).

Student records in the Services are intended for use by the student and the student’s course instructor in compliance with existing laws regarding privacy of grades. Instructors have access to student submissions and the associated time and IP address. All students’ personal information is stored on servers at a location designed specifically to prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing the server or its data.

Instructors who wish to use certain Services provide WebAssign with their full name, email address, institution address, and other information regarding their institution and the courses they teach.
