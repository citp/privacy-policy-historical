## Full-text Version

WebAssign makes the Service available to instructors for homework, quizzes, and tests through paid subscription for specified classes and time durations. The purpose of the Service is to provide instructors with a secure, accessible platform to assess student performance and comprehension and assign grades.

### Information Collected

Students provide their username, institution name, and password when logging on to the Service to complete assignments. The login information is required to determine which assignment should be delivered and who should receive credit for the submission. All login information is sent from your computer to WebAssign’s server as encrypted data.

Student usernames are typically provided to WebAssign by an instructor, the institution name is determined by WebAssign, and the password is usually initially provided by the instructor. You should change your password before starting to use the Service to prevent unauthorized access to your assignments. In some cases, students may create their own username and password.

An instructor using the Service uploads a class roster that includes the student's full name, username, initial password, student number (optional), and e-mail address (optional). Your instructor uses this information to identify and communicate with you about your assignments. Students may also add their e-mail address to their account through the Service.

Student records in the Service are intended for use by the student and the student's course instructor in compliance with existing laws regarding privacy of grades. Your instructors have access to your submissions and the associated time and IP address. All student personal information is stored on servers at a location designed specifically prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing the server or its data. Instructors who wish to use the Service provide WebAssign with their full name, email address, institution address, and other information regarding their institution and the courses they teach.

WebAssign uses "cookies" to identify users when they are logged into the Service. A cookie is a data file that a web site writes and sends to your computer when you visit the site. The Service will not be functional unless you accept use of Internet cookies. Our cookie file contains an encrypted version of your username and school. This information is used to identify who you are when you make a request to the Service. If you allow your browser to accept WebAssign cookies, a cookie is set and trusted when you return to the Service after visiting an external site. After you log out of the Service, the cookie is deleted. We are not responsible for the use of cookies by other Web sites that may be accessed through us.

WebAssign gathers information about its users collectively and automatically logs IP addresses, session sources, and other data that track access to the Site. We analyze these logs to better understand aggregate behavior and to monitor Service performance. The logs are analyzed to ascertain the overall aggregate trends they reveal about our users, but not as a means of tracking the behavior of individual users outside our site. This information is used for the purposes of maintaining and improving the Service, and expanding its capabilities.

### Use and Disclosure of Collected Information

We do not use or share your personal information with others except as indicated in this Privacy Policy.

WebAssign will use your personal information to provide the Service to you, alert you of new Service features and enhancements, respond to your support issues, and/or notify you of upgrade opportunities, promotions, and special offers. You agree that we may communicate with you via email and similar technologies for any purpose relating to the Site or the Service.

The use of student information in the Service beyond the purposes of providing assessment falls under the discretion of the instructor. WebAssign recommends prior disclosure by the instructor to their students of any other intended uses, such as research.

WebAssign administrative responsibilities include "access to" but not "publication of" student records in individually identifiable ways. WebAssign accesses student information for backup, internal maintenance, improvement of the Service, and technical support for instructors. If WebAssign accesses student information, it is to troubleshoot the Service or to respond to an instructor's question. We take the utmost efforts to not divulge student information to unauthorized individuals. We strive to ascertain whether authorized persons are able to access the information correctly and to inform instructors how to access it.

WebAssign may use aggregate information to determine the demographics of our users and to distribute statistics and general marketplace information about WebAssign. These demographics will always represent aggregate information and will not identify a specific user.

  * to companies who work for WebAssign to provide one or more parts of the Service or that provide related administrative functions (such as support services, web analytics, and fraud detection). These third parties may have access to your personal information; if they do, this access is only so that they may perform these tasks on our behalf and they are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose; or
  * when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with a legal process or law, or to respond to a government request for information, (2) enforce the terms of use or other agreements, (3) respond to claims that any content on the Site or Service violates the rights of third parties, or that otherwise arise from your use of the Service, or (4) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of WebAssign, its users, or the public.
