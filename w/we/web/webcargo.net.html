<p>WEBCARGO<br>Site Privacy Coordinator<br>PO Box.329 Stock Exchange Tower<br>Montréal (Québec) H4Z 1G8<br>CANADA<br><a class="intext-link" href="mailto:privacy@webcargo.net?subject=Privacy Policy">privacy@webcargo.net</a></p>

<p>Please note that the Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time so please check back periodically. The updated policy will be displayed or linked to web pages at WEBCARGO.net. By using WEBCARGO.net after the updated policy has been so posted, you consent and agree, without limitation or qualification, to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information and to the privacy practices set out in the updated Privacy Policy. Personal information collected prior to the posting of the updated Privacy Policy will only be used or disclosed for new purposes set out in an updated Privacy Policy once you have consented to such use by using WEBCARGO.net after the updated policy has been posted to WEBCARGO.net.</p>

<p><strong>1. What information of yours does WEBCARGO.net collect?</strong></p>
<p>The goal of WEBCARGO.net is to help you sending your e-document and simplyfied the management of doing it. To achieve this goal, WEBCARGO.net needs to collect personal information.</p>
<p>Personal information includes information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name and postal code. Wherever and whenever WEBCARGO collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. WEBCARGO collects personal information in the following ways from different parts of WEBCARGO.net:</p>
<p>Personal information is gathered when you voluntarily register with WEBCARGO.net. If you choose to register you may provide WEBCARGO with your name, postal code, email address and other information. While not all of this information is required, the more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. If you choose not to provide the requested information, WEBCARGO.net may not be able to offer you some of the personalized services that depend on this type of information to function. However to register, you still have the option of providing only the minimum necessary information.</p>
<p>If you contact WEBCARGO.net, we may keep a record of that correspondence. We do not collect any email addresses of those who communicate with WEBCARGO.net via email. We use the information provided only so that we may respond to the email.</p>

<p><strong>2. What are "cookies" and "web beacons" and how does WEBCARGO use them?</strong></p>
<p>We also collect anonymous information using "cookies." A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a web site to the hard drive of your computer so that the web site may identify you without having to sign in each time. This unique number identifies your browser-- but not you -- to WEBCARGO.net computers whenever you visit WEBCARGO.net. A cookie will NOT let a web site know any personal information about you, such as your real name and address. The coding in the cookies WEBCARGO sets lets us know that you are using a particular computer but nothing more. Since cookies are only text files, they cannot run on your computer, search your computer for other information or transmit any information to anyone.</p>
<p>To help serve you better WEBCARGO uses cookies to:</p>
<p>Help us remember who you are through your browser settings so that WEBCARGO can offer and provide personalized services. WEBCARGO uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about what is done and seen across WEBCARGO.net. Cookies also allow us to save passwords and preferences for you so that you will not have to re-enter them the next time you visit.</p>
<p>Measure traffic patterns: Without cookies, it could be difficult for WEBCARGO to know that certain services are more popular than others are. This information helps us to better understand when to offer new services.</p>
<p>Estimate audience size: Cookies help us know whether or not users have seen particular displays, including advertisements.</p>
<p>Displaying advertisements: WEBCARGO and third party advertising networks used by WEBCARGO may use cookies when serving advertisements. See section 3 below for details on the information gathering practices of our ad serving partners.</p>
<p>Cookies are used on most major web sites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser either to notify you when you have received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. You should understand that while WEBCARGO does not require you to use cookies, certain sites will not function properly if you set your browser to not accept cookies.</p>
<p>WEBCARGO.net may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow WEBCARGO to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your personal information on WEBCARGO.net; they are a technique used to compile aggregated statistics about WEBCARGO.net usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. WEBCARGO.net web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there by our advertising partner to help WEBCARGO determine the effectiveness of our Internet advertising campaigns.</p>

<p><strong>3. What organization is collecting the information?</strong></p>
<p>When you provide personal registration information at WEBCARGO.net , that information is collected by WEBCARGO. It may be disclosed to other organizations in the circumstances described in Section 5 below.</p>
<p>The majority of the online banner advertisements you see on WEBCARGO.net are served through a reputable third party. If you would like to know more about what information is collected and how information is used by our third party ad server or about its "opt-out" procedures, please click here www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy.</p>
<p>Be aware that WEBCARGO.net sponsors and other advertisers have links on our sites that take you to other sites that may collect personal information about you. This Privacy Policy does not cover third party data collection practices and WEBCARGO does not assume any responsibility for the actions of such third parties.</p>

<p><strong>4. How does WEBCARGO.net use the information it collects?</strong></p>
<p>Any personal information you provide to WEBCARGO when registering for Services at WEBCARGO.net is maintained and accessible only by WEBCARGO, unless specifically stated otherwise. WEBCARGO requests information from its users so that users can enjoy customized experiences across WEBCARGO.net , including personalization services.</p>
<p>WEBCARGO may use the information it collects as follows:</p>
<p>To offer its users the ability to customize or personalize content on WEBCARGO.net ,</p>
<p>To deliver products and services requested.</p>
<p>WEBCARGO uses the anonymous, aggregate data collected to inform our sponsors and advertisers as to numbers of people who have certain demographic characteristics and the number of those people who have seen and "clicked" on their advertisement(s). We will also disclose to those third-party sponsors and advertisers the overall demographics available regarding who saw and "clicked" on their advertisement. No personal information will be disclosed to these sponsors and advertisers as part of this process; only information in an anonymous, aggregate form will be disclosed.</p>
<p>WEBCARGO also uses the anonymous, aggregate data to perform statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our registered users and visitors, to measure user demographics and interests regarding specific areas of WEBCARGO.net, to describe our services to third parties such as prospective business partners and advertisers and to analyze how and where best to use our resources. Without such data, we would not know what the most popular areas of WEBCARGO.net are, and we would not be able to change and update the content and services appropriately. WEBCARGO also uses such data to monitor and improve the operation of WEBCARGO.net and to maintain the quality of the Services made available through WEBCARGO.net. No personal information will be disclosed during these activities.</p>
<p>With your specific permission, WEBCARGO may, from time to time, use your personal information to contact you about changes or enhancements to Products and Services on WEBCARGO.net . If you indicated that you were interested in receiving offers or information from selected WEBCARGO.net sponsors and advertisers, WEBCARGO will send you email publications and mailings about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. For those who elect to receive such materials from WEBCARGO or third parties, and who indicate that they do in their profile, WEBCARGO will release personal information. Personal information released includes name, email address and other necessary information supplied in WEBCARGO.net registration process. If at any time you would like to end your subscription to any email materials, follow either the directions posted at the bottom of the email material, or the directions at the email newsletter company's web site.</p>
<p>WEBCARGO may also use personal information if it has reasonable grounds to believe the information could be useful when investigating a contravention of a federal, provincial or foreign law; for an emergency that threatens an individual's life, health or security; if the use is clearly in the individual's interest and consent is not available in a timely way; or if knowledge and consent would compromise the availability or accuracy of the information and collection is required to investigate a breach of an agreement or contravention of a federal or provincial law.</p>
<p>WEBCARGO may disclose personal information (i) to an advocate or notary or a barrister or solicitor who is representing it; (ii) if required to comply with a subpoena or warrant issued or an order made by a court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information, or to comply with rules of court relating to the production of records; (iii) to a government institution or part of a government institution that has made a request for the information, identified its lawful authority to obtain the information and indicated that (A) it suspects that the information relates to national security, the defence of Canada or the conduct of international affairs, (B) the disclosure is requested for the purpose of enforcing any law of Canada, a province or a foreign jurisdiction, carrying out an investigation relating to the enforcement of any such law or gathering intelligence for the purpose of enforcing any such law, or (C) the disclosure is requested for the purpose of administering any law of Canada or a province; (iv) to a person who needs the information because of an emergency that threatens the life, health or security of an individual; (v) for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province; or (vi) where otherwise required by law.</p>
<p>WEBCARGO may disclose personal information in connection with a corporate re-organization, a merger or amalgamation with another entity, or a sale of all or a substantial portion of the assets of WEBCARGO provided that the personal information disclosed continues to be used for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy by the entity acquiring the information.</p>

<p><strong>5. With whom does WEBCARGO.net share the information that is collected?</strong></p>
<p>In order to provide you with content and services that match your interests, WEBCARGO may disclose personal information to its agents, suppliers and service providers in conjunction with providing you with Products and Services or operating portions of WEBCARGO.net . Such entities will be required to use personal information provided solely for such purposes. In addition, WEBCARGO may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services.</p>
<p>WEBCARGO does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. WEBCARGO may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your personal information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not disclosed to the third party.</p>

<p><strong>6. How can you access, edit or delete your information?</strong></p>
<p>WEBCARGO.net provides its registered users the ability to access and edit the personal information in their user profiles. Currently, to access and edit your personal information, you have to go to WEBCARGO.net. WEBCARGO also offers all users who have volunteered any personal information to WEBCARGO the opportunity to review the information provided and to rectify any inaccuracies.

<p>You can opt-out of providing personal information and from receiving information on WEBCARGO.net updates and new services, as well as direct email offers from selected WEBCARGO.net partners and sponsors. This is done at the point of initial collection of information and during the editing or updating process. The process to opt out of WEBCARGO.net email materials is the same as the process for editing user information profiles described above. In addition, all such email materials have easy-to-follow unsubscribe directions posted at the bottom of the email. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at <a class="intext-link" href="mailto:info@webcargo.net?subject=Info">info@webcargo.net</a></p>

<p><strong>8. What kinds of security procedures are in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your information?</strong></p>
<p>WEBCARGO.net has security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your user data under our control. WEBCARGO attempts to keep such information in secure facilities, protected from unauthorized access and kept only as long as is reasonably required. Only persons who have a need to know your personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy have access to the user data you choose to provide to us. WEBCARGO has imposed strict rules on WEBCARGO.net employees who have access to the databases that store user personal information or to the servers that host our services. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, we make reasonable efforts to prevent such occurrences. Any other particularly sensitive information, such as your credit card number collected for a commerce transaction is encrypted prior to transmission. WEBCARGO is not liable for any use or disclosure of your personal information that is beyond our reasonable control.</p>
<p>You are responsible for the security of your WEBCARGO.net ID and password. Please take care when using and storing them. WEBCARGO recommends that you do not divulge your password to anyone. You should log out of your browser at the end of each computer session to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence, especially if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.</p>

<p><strong>9. What you can do to better protect yourself on the Internet</strong></p>
<p>Know the risks.</p>
<p>When you communicate with others online, you should be aware that, when disclosing personal information such as one's actual name, member name or email address on a web page or any other medium, such information may be collected, used, and further disclosed by others outside WEBCARGO.net . Accordingly, if you do not want your personal information to be available to others arising from such activities you should not participate in such activities or you should limit the personal information you make available.</p>                </div>
