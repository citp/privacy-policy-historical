## Webgains Privacy Policy

At webgains we constantly strive to better the services that we provide. Within that development process, the protection of data of all kinds is one of the key considerations. This Privacy Policy Document lays out the key elements of how we collect, store and transfer personal data. Webgains is registered under the Data Protection Act 1998 and conforms to the eight principles of good practice.

**What personally identifiable information is collected by webgains?**

Webgains collects and holds personal data (e.g. name, address, telephone number etc) of every person who has successfully registered on the website [www.webgains.com](http://www.webgains.com/) as an affiliate or a merchant. In addition, webgains may collect contact details given by you in order for us to supply you with more information. Webgains does not collect information about you unless you specifically provide it to us. As a necessary condition of registration, you consent to webgains collecting and holding such information to allow us to fulfil our obligations to you. We do not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to other companies or individuals, unless we have your consent.

**How do we use this information?**

Webgains will only use the information that you have provided to us for the reason that you have provided the information. Hence, if you provide us with your cv during the process of applying for a job with webgains, we will only use that information within the context of assessing your suitability for that particular job.

With the exception of statutory requests, should any material changes be made to the way in which we use that information, webgains will notify you by email of that change at least 14 days before the change of use.

**Where and how is this information stored?**

The webgains systems are designed and built with data protection as one of the key considerations. Consequently, our data is stored on our web server in a secure data centre in the United Kingdom and is not accessible by any other person or system. In addition, webgains employees access your data on a need to know basis. Every webgains employee has been suitably briefed on what constitutes the acceptable treatment of personal data.

Webgains also collects web use and transactional data relating to the affiliate marketing programmes which form the basis of our business. This information is collected, transferred and stored on secure servers in a secure data centre in the United Kingdom, and is not accessible by any unauthorised person or system. IP addresses are not stored for longer than 24 hours, and are temporarily used to determine domain type and in some cases, geographic region.
