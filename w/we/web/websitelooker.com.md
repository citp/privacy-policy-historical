**2.What types of information will websitelooker.com collect?**

If you are visiting the websitelooker.com website (websitelooker.com), we collect the following information: the full Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the Web page from which you came to websitelooker.com; your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, which may include a domain name; the date and time for each page you view.

If you download and install the Status Bar Addon Service software, which provides the websitelooker.com Status Bar Addon, we collect any information voluntarily provided by you during the installation and registration process, which can include your e-mail address as well as demographic information such as gender, age, occupation, household income, zip code and country. Any e-mail address that you may give us during the installation process is kept separate from information collected during your use of the Status Bar Addon Service and is not used to correlate your identity to Web usage path.

When you use the Status Bar Addon Service, we collect information about the websites you visit, and the pages you view. This information allows us to provide you with information about the Web page you are viewing and to estimate as to how much a website is worth. Thus, for every Web page you view while using the Status Bar Addon Service, the websitelooker.com software transmits and stores the following information from your computer to websitelooker.com:

This information often appears after a question mark ("?") in the URL, although it can appear in other places. This means that your name, your address, your e-mail address, or similar information you might consider private or personally identifiable which you enter into a Web page sometimes becomes part of a URL that is then transmitted to websitelooker.com and automatically stored in websitelooker.com's databases.

**_Glossary of Terms_**

**Usage Paths**

A usage path is the trail of requests automatically transmitted to and logged by websitelooker.com as user surfs the Internet with the websitelooker.com Status Bar Addon enabled. Usage paths consist of the following data for each Web page visited by a websitelooker.com user: (a) the IP address assigned to the user; (b) the date and time the Web page is visited by the user; (c) the full URL that the site assigns to the Web page.

**Uniform Resource Locator**

A URL (or uniform resource locator) is the full Web address of a file or document you view when browsing the Internet. With most browsers, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox, the URL of every Web page that you view is displayed in a window near the top of the screen. Typically, a URL consists of four parts: protocol, server (or domain) where the file is located, path, and filename. However, some URLs have no path or filename. An example of a URL is:

http://www.websitelooker.com/company/index.html

http is the protocol  
www.websitelooker.com is the server  
company/ is the path  
index.html is the filename

**Internet Protocol Address**

An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a set of numbers that is automatically assigned to your computer each time you connect to the Internet. When you use your Web browser to request a Web page from another computer on the Internet, your Web browser automatically gives that computer your IP address so that the data you request can be sent to your computer. For many users who access the Internet from a dial-up Internet service provider (ISP), the IP address will be different every time they log on ("dynamic" IP addresses); others may be assigned only one IP address that remains the same from session to session ("static" IP addresses) (more common with broadband ISPs).

**Domain Name**

A domain name identifies one or more IP addresses. Domain names are used in URLs to identify particular Web pages. For example, in the URL http://www.websitelooker.com/site/company, the domain name is websitelooker.com.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small data file consisting of numbers, letters, or other characters that a server sends to your browser and stores on your computer's hard drive. The cookie automatically identifies your computer, but not your identity.

You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) However, if a browser is set to reject cookies, it may encounter functionality problems with the websitelooker.com Status Bar Addon Service.

**Status Bar Addon**

The websitelooker.com Status Bar Addon consists of buttons or links on your Web browser and enables you to use the websitelooker.com Status Bar Addon Service.

**Browser**

A browser, short for Web browser, is a software application used to locate and display Web pages. Two popular browsers are Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer.
