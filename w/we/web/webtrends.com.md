# WebTrends Privacy Policy

Your Privacy

WebTrends Inc. is committed to maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers and visitors to our web site. In particular, we want you to know that we are not in the business of selling or renting individuals' personal data to other companies for marketing purposes. In this Privacy Policy we provide detailed information on when and why we collect personal information, how we use it, the limited conditions under which we may disclose it to others, and how we keep it secure.

Collection and Use of Personal Information

Personal information means any information that may be used to identify you, such as your name, title, phone number, email address, or mailing address. 

In general, you can browse our web site without giving us any personal information. We use our own product, [WebTrends _On Demand_](https://web.archive.org/Products/WebTrends7/OnDemandvsSoftware.aspx), to analyze traffic to this web site in order to understand our customers' and visitors' needs and to continually improve our site for them. WebTrends On Demand collects only anonymous, aggregate statistics. For example, we do not tie a specific visit to a specific IP address. For more information, see [Privacy Statement for Visitors to Sites Tracked by WebTrends _On Demand_](https://ondemand.webtrends.com/privacypolicy.asp#PSFV). 

If you want to subscribe to our newsletter WebResults, we ask you to simply provide your business email address. In this case, we use your email address only in connection with providing you the newsletter and for no other purpose. 

Other activities on our site do not require you to be registered. However, unless you have registered with us by creating a "WebTrends All Access" pass (see below) you will need to input your details each time you visit. Those details will only be used to fulfill your specific request and will not be used by WebTrends for any other purpose.

Additional activities on our site require you to be registered-for example, to download a trial or register for an event. As part of the registration process, we ask you to create a WebTrends All Access pass where we collect additional personal information. We use that information for several general purposes: to tell you about products, seminars and services if you so request; to fulfill your request; to contact you if we need to obtain or provide additional information; to verify the accuracy of our records; or to contact you regarding customer satisfaction surveys. 

Disclosure of Personal Information

In some instances we rely on our channel partners to fulfill product trials and information requests, and provide customers and prospective customers with information about WebTrends and its solutions. To do this, we may pass your information to them for that purpose only, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 

We sometimes hire vendor companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering items, sending postal mail, providing technical support, and processing event registrations. In addition, we may use third party information or technology in our products and disclose customer information to such third parties solely for the purposes of fulfillment, support, or audit by such third parties. We may also license/transfer or sell-off our technology to third parties, and in connection with such transitions, we may disclose customer data to the transferee. 

If you require further information on the channel partners, vendor companies or third parties to whom your information may have been passed to please contact [privacy@webtrends.com](mailto:privacy@webtrends.com). 

Because we have a global presence, your personal information may be shared with other offices or subsidiaries within WebTrends Inc. in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere. The data protection laws in these countries may be more or less extensive than laws in the country in which you are located. However, all offices of WebTrends Inc. are governed by this Privacy Policy and will use your personal information only as set forth in this policy. At your request, we can provide you with data protection details of the countries relevant to you. 

By using our web site and providing us with your personal data, you consent to this transfer of your personal data. 

We may also disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange or other disposition (whether of assets, stock or otherwise) of all or a portion of a our business and/or the business of our subsidiaries or to (1) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on us or this web site; (2) protect and defend our rights, property and this web site; (3) enforce our agreements with you, or (4) act in urgent circumstances to protect personal safety or the public. 

Children and Privacy 

Our web site does not offer information intended to attract children. We do not knowingly solicit personal information from children under the age of 13.

Security of Personal Information 

When you submit any form on webtrends.com, we use a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) helps protect your information as it travels over the Internet by encrypting that information before it is sent to us. We have also implemented industry-standard security mechanisms and procedures to protect data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

Use of Cookies 

A cookie is a small text file containing information that a web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies allow us to analyze our site traffic patterns and to provide a user-friendly registration and log-in process. A cookie can not give us access to your computer or to information beyond what you provide to us. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. Consult your browser's manual or online help if you want information on restricting or disabling the browser's handling of cookies. If you disable cookies, you can still view the publicly available information on our web site, but you will not be able to take advantage of offers or activities requiring a WebTrends All Access pass, which includes accessing customer-only support areas. If you are using a shared computer and you have cookies turned on, be sure to log off when you finish. 

"Refer-a-Friend"

From time to time, we may encourage our customers and web site visitors to tell a friend about WebTrends products, services or events. If a customer or visitor chooses to refer a friend to us, we will use that friend's information only for the purposes of sending WebTrends-related information to that friend. We will use the information only once and it will not be stored in our systems. 

Links to Other Web Sites

Our web site contains links to information on other web sites. We do not have any control over these other web sites, and therefore we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information that you provide while visiting those sites. Those sites are not governed by this Privacy Policy, and if you have questions about how a site uses your information, consult that site's privacy statement.
