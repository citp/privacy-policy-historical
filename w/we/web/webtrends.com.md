###### Information We Collect

Here are a few ways we collect your information and the types of information we collect. We may also obtain information from other sources. Information we collect may be in the form of personal information or anonymized data. Anonymized data may be in the form of aggregate data. Aggregate data is information we collect about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, no personal information is included in aggregate data. Aggregate data helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our products and services. This Policy does not restrict or limit our collection and use of aggregate data.

**Information You Provide To Us**

We collect personal information you give us. These are the general types of information we may collect from you:

**Registration and Profile Information** – When you register to use our service, to receive information, to participate in our events, and create or update your forum profile, we may collect various kinds of information about you. For example, we may collect: your name; postal address; phone numbers; fax numbers and email address; your log-in ID and password; your title; company; and other profile information you provide; demographic information; and information linked with your profile such as comments you may post.

**Submissions and Customer Service** – From time to time we may use surveys, contests, or sweepstakes requesting personal information. Information we collect may include demographic information, information about your personal interests, and your feedback as a valued client.

**Information We Automatically Collect**

When you visit our site or use our services, some information such as your computer’s operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type and language, and the website you visited before our Corporate Websites is logged automatically and stored in log files. We also collect information about your usage and activity on our Corporate Websites. We may tie your IP address to information we automatically collect on our Corporate Websites. We may also tie information we automatically collect with personal information, such as your login ID and information you give us at registration. We use our own products, and products of third parties acting on our behalf, to analyze, optimize, and improve our site. To opt-out of online behavioral advertising, please visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.

We will also collect information on your usage of the SaaS Solutions to ensure the security of the data we collect on behalf of our clients. You cannot opt-out of this collection and processing as it is necessary to ensure the security of the service we provide to our clients.

Webtrends and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics providers, and leads management providers use cookies and similar tracking technologies to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements around the site, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.

**Information We Obtain from Other Sources**

Webtrends may collect information about you from third party sources and services. We may buy or lease contact, marketing, and demographic data from brokers. Webtrends may also access certain profile information such as friends, profile picture, etc. from social networking platforms and services that you use to interact with Webtrends Corporate Websites and SaaS Solutions. We may combine that third party information with information we collect directly from you.

Webtrends may store and process personal information in the U.S., EU member countries, and other countries. Webtrends participates in the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield program and adheres to the Privacy Shield principles regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from the EU and Switzerland.

###### Sharing Of Personal Information

**Information You Share**

We may engage third parties to provide forums that allow you to connect and share your profile, actions, comments, content, and information publicly and with others. We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums. To learn how the third party applications use your information, please review their privacy policies. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, follow the instructions in the section titled Your Information Choices and Changes below. We may also allow you to connect and share on third party sites and services. For example, we use a single sign-on service that allows you to sign into Webtrends forums using certain third-party social networking login credentials. This allows you to link your existing social network profile to your Webtrends account. Once connected, you will be able to share and post content on and with the third-party site from Webtrends and share and interact with your friends.

Please be mindful of your own privacy needs as you choose with which third party services to connect, with whom you connect, and what to share and make public. We cannot control the privacy or security of information you choose to make public or share with others. If you share information about others, we suggest you get consent for any information you may share about them.

Webtrends uses the SalesForce platform to power its client portal ([https://my.webtrends.com](https://my.webtrends.com/)). All personal data collected within this portal is owned by Webtrends; SalesForce’s only right is that of a data processor acting on behalf of Webtrends as data controller. Processing such personal data is intrinsic to the purpose of the portal. Should you not want your personal data to be processed, your only option is to stop using the portal – you can do so by contacting [comprefs@webtrends.com](mailto:comprefs@webtrends.com).

**Information We Share**

Corporate Websites only – We do not sell and share your personal information with third parties other than as follows:

  * in an aggregated form that does not directly identify you;
  * with your consent, for example, when you agree to our sharing your information with other third parties for their own marketing purposes subject to their separate privacy policies;
  * with third party vendors, consultants and other service providers such as email service providers, marketing service providers, blog service providers and forum service providers who are working on our behalf and need access to your information to carry out their work for us, these service providers are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us;
  * when we do a business deal, or negotiate a business deal, involving sale or transfer of all or a part of our business or assets. These deals can include any merger, financing, acquisition, or bankruptcy transaction or proceeding.

###### Retention and Security of your Personal Information

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as log in credentials), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure transport layer security (TLS). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it, including encryption in transit, strict access controls, firewalls and intrusion detection systems, hardening and patching procedures, and malware protection. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Webtrends retains personal information it collects as a data controller consistent with its data retention policy. Retention of Client Data (defined below) is documented in Webtrends Data Retention Policy.

###### Links to 3rd Party Sites

Our Corporate Websites includes links to other websites, mobile sites, and/or mobile applications whose privacy practices may differ from those of Webtrends. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any site you visit.

**Social Media Widgets**

Our Corporate Websites includes certain social media features, such as the Facebook button. These features may collect your IP address, may collect which page you are visiting on our Corporate Websites, and may set a cookie to enable such feature to function properly. Social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Corporate Websites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
