PRIVACY AND SECURITY STATEMENT

Hostelworld.com realises some people are unsure about entering their personal details into websites over the Internet. Below, we explain how we use your information and how we protect your privacy. [Hostelworld.com](http://hostelworld.com/) and its associated companies respect and protect your right to privacy in relation to your interactions with this website. Any information which is provided by you to [Hostelworld.com](http://hostelworld.com/) via this website or otherwise will be treated in accordance with the terms of the Data Protection Acts, 1988 and 2003 and/or such amending or replacement legislation as may be adopted in Ireland from time to time. 

**INFORMATION REQUIRED TO PROCESS YOUR BOOKING**  
For us to process a booking for you, we require some information from you. This includes your name, nationality, your gender (or the gender of the group you are in), your phone number and email address. Also, since we confirm your booking while you are on the site, we require your credit or debit card details so we can confirm your booking when you pay your deposit. 

**WHO SEES YOUR INFORMATION**  
We are required to send your information to the travel services provider with which you booked travel services so that the travel service provider knows who you are and when you will use its travel services. We give your name, your nationality, your gender (or the gender of the group you are in), your phone number, your email address, your credit card details and of course, the details of your booking. The travel service provider requires this information to accept a confirmed booking from you. All travel service providers on whose behalf we facilitate bookings have agreed to the Hostelworld.com terms and conditions and accept this privacy policy.

**SECURITY**  
All sensitive information exchanged between your computer and our site is encrypted using SSL. Our SSL Cert. is provided by Verisign. This ensures that your information is transmitted securely and is safe from third parties. You should be aware that where you link to another web site from this web site, that Hostelworld.com has no control over that other web site. Accordingly, Hostelworld.com cannot guarantee that the controller of that web site will respect your privacy in the same manner as Hotelworld.com

**HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION**  
We only use your email address for sending you a confirmation of your bookings or to contact you for any reason directly linked to your booking, or occasionally to inform you of new features on Hostelworld.com. We only use your phone number to contact you urgently if there is a problem with your booking. You have the right to request a copy of the information which we hold about you (for which we may charge you a small fee) and to have inaccuracies in the information corrected. On occasions, we may supply statistics about our customers to third-parties such as hostels or other agents. These statistics never contain personally identifying information.

**HOSTELWORLD.COM, ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, SERVANTS AND AGENTS, AFFILIATES OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE PARENT AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIMS, EMERGENCIES, DEMANDS, CAUSES OF ACTION, DAMAGES, LOSSES, EXPENSES INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS OF PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE AND/OR DISSEMINATION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO YOU IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND YOUR CONSENT.**

Hostelworld.com reserves the right in its sole discretion to amend this Privacy and Security Statement at any time and you should regularly check this privacy policy for any amendments.
