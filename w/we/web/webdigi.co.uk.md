## Privacy Policy

Webdigi has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. 

We do not sell, rent, exchange or distribute your private information to any outside parties. 

The referring URL is logged whenever you view a page on the Webdigi website. This allows us to see which areas are more popular than others on the website, the paths taken to reach each page, and it also allows us to gauge the effectiveness of any promotional programs we may be running at the time. 

Webdigi website runs Google Analytics to view visitor information and other visitor analytics provided by the service. 

All such information is gathered globally rather than individually, and no information is linked to any identifying information about you. Such aggregated data may be disclosed, for example, to potential and current advertisers providing them with information about the number of people viewing their ads and how many have clicked on them. No personal information is collected by Webdigi from visitors to the website, when viewing pages, or when navigating a direct link. 

Webdigi ensures appropriate security of the information the user submits. From the moment Webdigi has received the information, it will be processed with the greatest confidentiality and security, which legislation requires. 

The registration of your IP address is part of our system administration and the IP address does not give us the possibility of identifying you as a person.
