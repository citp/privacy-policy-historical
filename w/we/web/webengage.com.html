<span class="bodyheading">What personally identifiable information do we collect?</span>
<br><br>

	<span class="bodytext">
	Our primary goal in collecting personal information or other information about you or your company is to provide you with the best and most useful content and services.

	<ul>
		<li>We have your consent to share the information
