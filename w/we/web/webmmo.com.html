    	<p style="color:#FF6600">This  site is owned and operated by www.KUNGFUKNIGHTS.com. Your privacy on the  Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At www.KUNGFUKNIGHTS.com, we want  to make your experience online satisfying and safe.</p>
  <p>Because we  gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully  understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and  use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we  gather and how we use it. INFORMATION www.KUNGFUKNIGHTS.com GATHERS AND TRACKS,  www.KUNGFUKNIGHTS.com gathers two types of information about users: Information  that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary  submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate in our  message boards or forums, to email a friend, and from participation in polls  and surveys:</p>
  <p>Information www.KUNGFUKNIGHTS.com gathers through aggregated tracking  information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This  information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to  help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our  audience. Because www.KUNGFUKNIGHTS.com derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships  and advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to  keeping our service free to users. Under no circumstances does www.KUNGFUKNIGHTS.com  divulge any information about an individual user to a third party. www.KUNGFUKNIGHTS.com  Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:</p>
  <p>Optional Voluntary Information<br>
  We offer the  following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of  personal information by users:</p>
  <p>Privacy  Policy Sample</p>
  <p>The following  is a list of different policies which can be edited to remove the parts of the  policy that are not needed. You should also add anything to this&nbsp;policy template&nbsp;that you may have on  your site.</p>
  <p>1. Electronic  newsletters policy (Dispatches)<br>
  We will offer a free electronic newsletter to users. www.KUNGFUKNIGHTS.com  gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may  remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in  every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page. Users  can also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration.</p>
  <p>2. Message boards/forums policy<br>
  Users of the site's Message Boards and Forums must register separately for  these services (both are free of charge) in order to post messages, although  they needn't register to visit the site. During registration the user is  required to supply a username, password, and email address.</p>
  <p>3. "E-mail this to a friend" policy<br>
  Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents  to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The user must  provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information  is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the  recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other  purpose.</p>
  <p>4. Polling<br>
  We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions  with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues.  Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to  any particular user. www.KUNGFUKNIGHTS.com may use a system to "tag"  users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular  question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.</p>
  <p>5. Surveys<br>
  www.KUNGFUKNIGHTS.com may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target  our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic  information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We  never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third  party.</p>
  <p><strong>Privacy  Policy Template changes</strong><br>
  The policy clause about children below is becoming more important as it is  nearly impossible to tell the age of any visitor. We recommend adding this  sample line to all your forms that request information.<br>
  </p><p><strong>Usage  tracking</strong><br>
  www.KUNGFUKNIGHTS.com tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites.  However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users.  www.KUNGFUKNIGHTS.com does break down overall usage statistics according to a  user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information  from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).</p>
  <p>www.KUNGFUKNIGHTS.com sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users  enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with  individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our  sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not  track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs  overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.</p>
  <p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
  We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of  your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although  it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have  specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie  can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off  your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. www.KUNGFUKNIGHTS.com  uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our  advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions  and click rates.</p>
  <p>You can  refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser  to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with  each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site.  However, you do need cookies to participate actively in message boards, forums,  polling and surveys.</p>
  <p><strong>Privacy  Policy Use</strong><br>

  </p><p><strong>USE OF  INFORMATION</strong><br>
  www.KUNGFUKNIGHTS.com uses any information voluntarily given by our users to  enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive  or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based  on the interests of our users.<br>
  As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to  send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls,  surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out newsletters to subscribers on  a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out  special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in  something we are doing. www.KUNGFUKNIGHTS.com never shares newsletter mailing  lists with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or partners.<br>
  When we use  tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't  like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users  read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to  build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search  function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't  track which terms a particular user enters.<br>
  www.KUNGFUKNIGHTS.com  creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for  advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise  more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are  pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of  individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user  clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual  user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect  the personal safety of our users or the public.</p>
  <p><strong>SHARING OF  THE INFORMATION</strong><br>
  www.KUNGFUKNIGHTS.com uses the above-described information to tailor our  content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our  audience's demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free.

  We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Opting not to register to receive our electronic newsletters. Opting not to  participate in certain interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need  to gather any personally identifiable information from our users.</p>
  <p><strong>YOUR CONSENT</strong><br>
