<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.&nbsp; For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Referrals</h4>

<p>We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Public Forums</h4>
<p>Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@webpt.com">privacy@webpt.com</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Testimonials</h4>
<p>We post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information.&nbsp; We obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Service Providers</h4>
<p>We use other third parties such as an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf. &nbsp;When you sign up for our services, we will share your personal information only as necessary for the third party to provide that service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</h4>
<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13 for sales purposes, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. &nbsp;However, some of our clients may have patients who are under 13 and their information would be safely secured in our encrypted database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Changes to This Policy</h4>
<p>We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
