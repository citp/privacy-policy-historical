### Security and Protection of Personal Information.

We maintain commercially reasonable standards of security and confidentiality to protect and ensure the security of your Personal Information. We also take commercially reasonable measures to prevent any open proxies, open relays and the dissemination of computer viruses, worms, or trojan horses in connection with our e-mail network. However, for most Internet websites, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of our Website in the same way. We also limit access to our Website by our own employees to individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our operational service providers follow the same policy. Review, Update or Delete Your Personal Information. Generally, you may review, update or delete any of your Personal Information collected by or through our Website. You may also correct factual inaccuracies. However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information, but cannot be deleted and if you delete or attempt to delete such information, it may result in the suspension of any and all rights you may have to use our Website, your registration as a user and/or other aspects of our Website or services we make available to you. If you have registered for our Website or provided any information as part of an account or profile in connection with our Website, you may review, update or delete your Personal Information and you should go to our Website and follow the instructions there that will explain how you can edit, change, update and, with some exceptions noted, delete your Personal Information.

We reserve the right to deny, suspend, deactivate, terminate and/or cancel any registration, use of or access to our Website and any services, content, activities, features or functions, if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to use or access any portion of our Website, to receive any services from us, to use or access any information or to use a user ID. If the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide you access to such information. In such cases, we will provide you with an explanation of why access cannot be provided and a contact person for further inquiries. 

### Privacy Rights of California Residents:

Residents of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California, a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an Opt-out or Opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may, instead, provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. Webair qualifies for the alternative option: it has a comprehensive Privacy Policy and provides you with details on how you may either decline to permit (Opt-out) or consent to (Opt-in) the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year. If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). Send an email to the Privacy Administrator at [privacy@webair.com.](mailto:privacy@webair.com) or you may contact us via postal mail at:
