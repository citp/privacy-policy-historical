We may use this personal information to improve our services to you and to customize your browsing experience. Because [www.webbyawards.com](http://www.webbyawards.com/) merely links to—and does not publish—content supplied by third parties or generally available on the Internet, [www.webbyawards.com](http://www.webbyawards.com/) is not responsible for information collected by these third parties, or for any information gathered by third party advertising companies through the use of banner ads.

#### How can you edit your personal information?

#### How does The Webby Awards protect and store customer information?

When you place an order or access your account information, we provide a secure server with secure server software (SSL) that encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. All of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access using industry-standard methods to secure our electronic databases.

Our servers and offices are located in the United States and Europe, so your information may be transferred to, stored, or processed in the United States and Europe. While the data protection, privacy, and other laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, we take many steps to protect your privacy.

A cookie—a small text file placed on a user’s hard drive—is generated by a software application on a site’s server. We use temporary session cookies to assign to you and store a SessionID on all secure pages, including in the voting system for The People’s Voice Awards to enable you to vote during multiple sessions. These cookies allow you to move uninterrupted between areas of our secure site. This SessionID is not personally identifiable to you and this type of cookie does not leave any retrievable information on your hard drive. We also use a third party service provider to collect non-personally identifiable IP addresses and entry-point and search form information to monitor the number of visitors to the site and the usage of our site. This is done through the use of both permanent and session cookies.

We use a session cookie on our site to determine whether or not you are accepting cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser to prevent that. Even without a cookie, you can still use most of the features on our site, but you cannot vote for The People’s Voiceor enter your site for a Webby Award.
