# Privacy Policy

WebEx respects your privacy. When using our sites, you may get information, access online products and services, communicate with us or link to other web sites with which we do business. While doing that, you may give us information so that we can provide enhanced products or services to you and to personalize your experience on our website. This online privacy policy describes how we use and protect Personally Identifiable Information that you share with us ("PII”). 

The following principles govern web-sites owned and operated by WebEx. These principles do not govern web-sites of other parties to which we may provide only links because WebEx is not responsible, and can not control the privacy practices or content of those sites. 

WebEx collects PII when you register for a WebEx account or use the WebEx products or services for the following purposes:

  * To deliver the products and services you or your company have ordered for your use from WebEx.
  * To maintain accounting and billing contact information and other financial records.
  * To customize the advertising and content you see. 
  * To contact you regarding our services unless you elected not to receive these communications.



   
When you register with WebEx, we ask for your name, email address, physical address, telephone numbers and, in some cases credit card information when you order services on-line. Some of our customers use WebEx services to provide sessions, such as web seminars, which require the participants to register prior to attending the session. When you register for one of these sessions, you may be asked to provide additional information such as your birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. This information is provided to the customer hosting the session. WebEx may store this information on behalf of our customers as necessary to fulfill our obligations to our customers. WebEx requires that all such customers use, hold and process such PII in accordance with applicable privacy laws. WebEx also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, WebEx cookie information and the page you requested. WebEx routinely collects information that cannot be identified to a particular individual such as time-stamps and logs events (like features used, number of participants, length of meetings.) This data is used for accounting/billing purposes as well as for performance and optimization of the WebEx services.

Like many websites, WebEx uses technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, which allow us to make your visit to our website easier, more efficient and more valuable by providing you with a customized experience and recognizing you when you return. A cookie is a small data file transferred by a website to your computer’s hard drive. The WebEx website sends cookies when you visit, make a purchase, request or personalize information, or register yourself for certain services. A cookie cannot read personal data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites; the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Accepting the cookies used on our website may give us access to information about your browsing behavior, which we may use to personalize your experience and track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. 

Cookies are typically classified as either "session" cookies or "persistent" cookies.

  * Session cookies do not stay on your computer after you close your browser
  * Persistent cookies remain on your computer until you delete them or they expire



  
You may browse most of the WebEx website without accepting cookies; however, some website functionality may be lost by disabling cookies on your computer. Other WebEx web pages, particularly those which require a login and password, require cookies and cannot be used when you have disabled cookies in your browser. 

In addition, WebEx uses web beacons in conjunction with cookies to understand user behavior. A web beacon is an electronic image, found on a website or HTML-formatted email and is called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF. The web beacon is one of the ingredients of the page, just like other images and text except it is so small and clear that it is effectively invisible. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on a user's computer such as cookies, time and date of a page view and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. They are simply a convenient way of gathering basic statistics and managing cookies, and do not give away any extra information from your computer. Turning off your browser's cookies will prevent web beacons from tracking your specific activity. The web beacon may still record an anonymous visit from your IP address, but unique information will not be recorded. 

WebEx may also use customized links or other similar technologies to track email links that you click. We may associate that information with your Personal Information in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or purchase information. Each e-mail communication includes an unsubscribe link allowing you to stop delivery of that type of communication. 

If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website or via HTML-formatted emails, you can set your browser to warn you before it accepts cookies or refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser _._

For additional information about cookies and other tracking technologies, including instructions for blocking their use, see _<http://privacy.getnetwise.org/browsing/tools>_

Third party cookies may be used to identify your interest in WebEx.  This information is used to determine if WebEx ads should be occasionally displayed on some web sites you visit. The information collected is anonymous and is not linked to your personal information.  You may choose to decline cookies from third-party ad servers, which WebEx does not control.   Third-party advertisement servers are subject to their own privacy policies. 

If we change any of our privacy policies or practices, we'll post those changes to this policy statement at least 30 days before they take effect. In limited cases, we may be required to disclose certain information to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant.

WebEx respects your privacy. When using our sites, you may get information, access online products and services, communicate with us or link to other web sites with which we do business. While doing that, you may give us information so that we can provide enhanced products or services to you and to personalize your experience on our website.

These principles do not govern web-sites of other parties to which we may provide only links because WebEx is not responsible, and can not control the privacy practices or content of those sites. 

  


WebEx will not sell or rent your PII to anyone.  
WebEx will send PII about you to other companies or people only when: 

  * We have your consent to share the information; 
  * We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; 
  * We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of WebEx to provide a WebEx product or service or to otherwise assist WebEx with its business activities. (Unless we tell you otherwise, these companies do not have any right to use the PII we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us and are required to safeguard PII and not to disclose PII to others)
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, or 
  * We find that your actions on our Web sites violate the WebEx Terms of Service.



  


You have the ability to direct WebEx to edit, correct or erase your PII , at any time. To request such account maintenance send your email request to [privacy@webex.com](mailto:privacy@webex.com). You may also indicate that you do not wish to receive messages from WebEx regarding our services or update your information relating to such messages at [unsubscribe@webex.com](mailto:unsubscribe@webex.com). Following your request for either type of data editing, your information will be changed in WebEx’s data bases after we receive the information necessary to process your request.

  


The WebEx switching environment is designed similarly to the telephone switching environment. Once the meeting is over the content of the meeting is not retained by WebEx unless the customer specifically requests that the content be recorded. WebEx uses industry standard encryption as well as its own proprietary technology to protect PII and meeting content. Further, the only means to participate in a meeting is through the WebEx invitation and join meeting process, which should include a password for each meeting. WebEx strongly recommends that all meetings be protected by passwords. In addition, the host has full control over attendee presence and may eject unwanted participants or lock a meeting to prevent additional participants.
