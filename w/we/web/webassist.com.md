We may make changes to the Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by sending an email to the address you have provided, posting the updated version of the Privacy Policy on the Web Site, or, through the use of cookies, informing you when you first sign on to the Web Site after we have made changes. If you receive notification of a change in our Privacy Policy, you must review the new Privacy Policy carefully to make sure you understand our practices and procedures. You may not be able to receive notices from us if your cookies are not set to accept. Your continued use of the Web Site will be subject to the then-current privacy policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. 

### What Types of Information Does WebAssist Collect From Me?

**Personal Information.** We collect Personal Information from you. As explained above, Personal Information is information that can be used to identify you individually, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, and email address. 

**Non-Personal Information.** We also collect "non-personal" information from you, such as your browser type, the URL of the previous web site you visited, your ISP, operating system, and your IP Address. This information ("Non-Personal Information") cannot be easily used to personally identify you. 

### How and When Does WebAssist Collect This Information?

**Providing Information to Us.** We collect Personal Information from you when you provide it to us. For example, if you purchase a product sold through the Web Site, we may collect your name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address. If you sign up to receive a newsletter, we will collect your email address. 

**Communications With Us.** If you communicate with us regarding the Web Site or the WebAssist Services, we will collect any information that you provide to us in any such communication, except credit card information. 

**Analytic and Reporting Technologies.** Like the operators of most web sites, we use analytic and reporting technologies to record Non-Personal Information such as Internet domain and host names, Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser software and operating system types, clickstream patterns, and the dates and times that the Web Site and the WebAssist Services are accessed. 

### How Does WebAssist Use My Information?

**Personal Information.** We use Personal Information primarily for our own internal purposes, such as providing, maintaining, evaluating, and improving the WebAssist Services and the Web Site, fulfilling requests for information, producing and shipping the products that you order, customer support, and to send you promotional information. For example, if you create an Affiliate Account, we will use the information that you provide to communicate with you and pay you any commissions that you earn. Similarly, if you sign up to receive a WebAssist newsletter, we will use the email address you provide to send you the newsletters. 

**Non-Personal Information.** We use non-personal information to track your use of the Web Site and the WebAssist Services and for other internal purposes, particularly providing, maintaining, evaluating, and improving the WebAssist Services and the Web Site. 

### How Does WebAssist Use My Information?

Generally speaking, we do not intentionally disclose your information to third parties without your consent. However we reserve the right to do so because it is necessary to the operation and continued growth of our business or to protect the rights of others. These instances are discussed below: 

**Disclosure to Successors.** We may disclose your Personal Information to any successor-in-interest of ours, such as a company that acquires us. In the event WebAssist goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. In the event of a change in ownership or control of your personal information, we will send a notice by email to the address that you have provided and/or post a notice on our Web Site of any such change. 

**Disclosure to Unaffiliated Third Parties.** We may disclose your Personal Information to prevent an emergency, to protect or enforce our rights, to protect or enforce the rights of a third party, or as required or permitted by law (including, without limitation, to comply with a subpoena or court order). In particular, if you are an Affiliate, we may disclose your information to a third party that alleges that you have infringed their intellectual property rights. Similarly, if you allege that an Affiliate allegedly infringes your intellectual property rights, we may disclose your information to that Affiliate. 

**Disclosure to Third-Party Service Providers.** We may contract with various third parties who help us provide and maintain the Web Site or the WebAssist Services. For example, we use a third-party to process payments made to us, and may subcontract out production, fulfillment, or other operations. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent such third parties from disclosing your Personal Information, except for the purpose of providing the services in question. We cannot guarantee that such third parties will not disclose your Personal Information. 

**Disclosure of Non-Personal Information.** We will disclose Non-Personal Information, in aggregate form, to potential strategic partners, advertisers, investors, customers, and others. You may not "opt out" of the sharing of this information. However, it cannot be easily used to identify you personally. 

**Opt In Use and Disclosure.** Users of the Web Site will have opportunities to opt-in to have their information used for other purposes. If you do not wish your information shared, it can be prevented by not opting-in for the particular purpose or promotion.

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information such as a credit card number on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). 

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.

You may be able to access third-party web sites directly from the Web Site. This Privacy Policy does not apply when you access such web sites.
