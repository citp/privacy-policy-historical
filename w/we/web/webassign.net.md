In order to provide secure, accurate, and efficient service, WebAssign must gather certain types of information about its users.

WebAssign is an online homework delivery, grading, and assessment service available to instructors through paid subscription for specified classes and time periods. The purpose of WebAssign is to provide instructors with a secure, accessible platform in which to assign and grade homework in order to assess student performance and comprehension. WebAssign can also be used for quizzes and testing, depending on the instructor's application of the system.  
  
Students provide their username, institution name, and password when logging on to the service to complete assignments. The login information is required to determine which homework assignment should be delivered and who should receive credit for the submission. The username is determined by your instructor, the institution name is determined by WebAssign, and the password is initially determined by your instructor. You should change your password before sting to use WebAssign to prevent unauthorized access to your homework. |   
  
Instructors using WebAssign upload the roster for your class, including your full name, username, initial password, student number (optional), and e-mail address (optional). Your instructor uses this information to identify and communicate with you about your homework.  
  
Your student records in WebAssign are intended for use by you and your course instructors in compliance with existing laws regarding privacy of grades. All of your personal information is stored on servers at a location designed specifically to ensure that no unauthorized individuals have access to the server or its data.

The use of student records in WebAssign beyond the purposes of providing assessment falls under the discretion of the instructor. WebAssign recommends prior disclosure by the instructor to their students of any other intended uses, such as research.  
  
WebAssign administrative responsibilities include "access to" but not "publication of" student records in individually identifiable ways. WebAssign administration accesses student records for backup, internal maintenance, improvement of the service, and technical support for instructors. If WebAssign accesses your student record, it is to troubleshoot the system or to respond to your instructor's question. We do not divulge your student information. Rather, we strive to ascertain whether authorized persons are able to access the information correctly and to inform your instructor how to access it.
