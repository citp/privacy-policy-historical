# WebAssign Info Pages - Privacy Statement

| **WebAssign Student Privacy Statement** We are committed to protecting the privacy of student records on WebAssign. In order to provide secure, accurate, and efficient service, WebAssign must gather certain types of information about its users. This privacy statement provides an overview of the terms and conditions surrounding the use of this information and discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices. Please review the statement in full to better understand how the information you provide to WebAssign will be employed.

WebAssign is an online homework delivery, grading, and assessment service available to instructors through paid subscription for specified classes and time periods. The purpose of WebAssign is to provide instructors with a secure, accessible platform in which to assign and grade homework in order to assess student performance and comprehension. WebAssign can also be used for quizzes and testing, depending on the instructor's application of the system.  
  
Students provide their username, institution name, and password when logging on to the service to complete assignments. The login information is required to determine which homework assignments should be delivered and who should receive credit for the submission. The username is determined by the instructor or institution, the institution name is determined by WebAssign, and the password is determined initially by the instructor or institution. WebAssign Users should change their password as soon as they start using WebAssign to prevent unauthorized access to class information and records. All log-in information is sent from your computer to our server as encrypted data. |   
  
Instructors upload a student roster for each class. The roster includes a student's full name, username, initial password, student number (optional), and e-mail address (optional). An instructor uses this information to identify and communicate with students about their homework.  
  
Student records in WebAssign are intended for use by the student and the student' course instructor in compliance with existing laws regarding privacy of grades. All of student personal information is stored on servers at a location designed specifically to ensure that no unauthorized individuals have access to the server or its data. Any passwords are stored in an encrypted format.  
  
WebAssign may use "[cookies](https://web.archive.org/web/20030622110507id_/http%3A//webassign.net/info/cookies.html)" to identify a user. A cookie is a data file that a web site writes to your computer when you visit that site. Our cookie file contains your username, school and other information indicating that you logged into WebAssign successfully, all as encrypted data. This information is used to identify who you are when you make a request to WebAssign. If you choose not to use cookies, you may be required to log in again depending on how you use your computer. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive a warning message each time the cookie is needed. After you log out of WebAssign, the cookie is deleted. WebAssign does not require you to use cookies.   
  
The use of student records in WebAssign beyond the purposes of providing assessment falls under the discretion of the instructor. WebAssign recommends prior disclosure by the instructor to their students of any other intended uses, such as research.  
  
WebAssign administrative responsibilities include "access to" but not "publication of" student records in individually identifiable ways. WebAssign administration accesses student records for backup, internal maintenance, improvement of the service, and technical support for instructors. If WebAssign accesses your student record, it is to troubleshoot the system or to respond to your instructor's question. We do not divulge your student information. Rather, we strive to ascertain whether authorized persons are able to access the information correctly and to inform your instructor how to access it.  
  
WebAssign gathers information about its users collectively and automatically logs IP addresses, session sources, and other data that track access to the WebAssign site. We analyze these logs to better understand aggregate behavior and to monitor system performance. The logs are analyzed to ascertain the overall aggregate trends they reveal about our users, but not as a means of tracking the behavior of individual users outside of our site. This information is used for the purposes of improving WebAssign or expanding its capabilities.  
  
WebAssign may use aggregate information to determine the demographics of our users and to distribute statistics and general marketplace information about WebAssign. These demographics will always represent aggregate information and will not identify a specific user.  
  
WebAssign will not give, sell, rent, loan, or otherwise disclose to any third parties the personal information you supply, except when we have your permission or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with a legal process, (2) enforce the terms of use, (3) respond to claims that any content on WebAssign.net violates the rights of third parties, or (4) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of WebAssign, its users, or the public.  
  
WebAssign will post any changes to this privacy statement at http://webassign.net/info. Your use of WebAssign signifies that you are in agreement with the terms and conditions of the WebAssign privacy statement. If you do not agree with this statement, please do not use WebAssign. Your continued use of our service following any changes posted to the privacy statement at <http://webassign.net/info/privacy.html> indicates that you accept those changes as well.
