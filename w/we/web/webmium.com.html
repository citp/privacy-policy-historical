<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

<p>At Webmium we care about your privacy and the security of your
personal data. We comply applicable with applicable data privacy
laws and regulations for your safety and security. In the following
we describe what information is collected and how we handle it.
This policy applies to all of the Webmium Products. Webmium is a
service offered by the Czech company Nexum Trilog a.s. (<a href="http://www.nexum.cz" target="_blank">www.nexum.cz</a>).</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this Policy, please don't
hesitate to <a href="mailto:privacy@webmium.com">contact us</a> or
write to Webmium Project, ATTN:&nbsp;<strong>nexum Trilog
a.s.,&nbsp;</strong> <span>Kolbenova 942/38a,&nbsp;</span>
<span>190 00 Praha 9, Czech Republic.</span></p>

<p>Webmium collects, processes, and uses personal data of a user
without further necessary agreement only insofar as it is necessary
for the establishment, fulfillment, and billing of the
contract.</p>

<p>Webmium is a website building and hosting service provided at <a href="http://www.webmium.com">www.webmium.com</a> and its directly
associated domains, tools, services and applications that are
operated by Nexum Trilog a.s. (collectively, "Webmium" or
"Services").</p>

<p>This "Privacy Policy" explains what information we gather from
our users and how we use it. By using or accessing our Services,
you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
(Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meaning set forth in
our <a href="http://www.webmium.com/en-US/terms">Terms of Service</a>).</p>

<p>Webmium is not intended for children under 13 years of age.
Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection
Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), we will never knowingly gather or use
personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of
13, and we do not allow anyone under the age of 13 to register on
Webmium.</p>

<h2>What information does Webmium gather?</h2>

<p>Webmium gathers and stores three types of information about
users that are subject to our Privacy Policy:</p>

<h3>Information users provide to us:</h3>

<p>These are voluntary submissions made when creating an account on
Webmium or through your use of the Services, such as your name,
date of birth, location and email address provided during
registration, Content posted, or payment information provided
during purchases. Please understand that when you sign into Webmium
or post Content, your information is not anonymous to us.</p>

<h3>Information we collect when you interact with Webmium:</h3>

<p>We keep track of the actions you take on Webmium, such as adding
an application, or posting Content. Also, when you access our
Services, we may collect information about your access method (such
as hardware and software attributes), location, IP address, and
pages you visit. In addition, we store certain information from
your browser using "cookies". (For more on cookies, please see the
section <a href="#toc-what-are-cookies">What are cookies?</a>)</p>

<h3>Information we receive from third parties:</h3>

<p>We do not own or operate the third-party applications, user
Webmium websites and other services offered that you may use or
interact with through Webmium (collectively, "Webmium-enhanced"
applications, Webmium websites and services). Whenever you visit,
use or interact with a Webmium -enhanced application, Webmium
website or service, we will receive information from them,
including information about actions you take and Content you post
on that application, Webmium website or service.</p>

<h2>Why does Webmium gather information about me?</h2>

<p>Webmium collects information in order to provide a safe,
efficient and customized experience. This information allows us to
better tailor our content to users' needs and to help us better
understand the demographics of our audience. Webmium may use some
of this information for contacting you, customizing the content and
advertising you view, improving our services, conducting research,
and providing anonymous reporting for clients. We only collect
personally identifiable information from you because you are
voluntarily submitting the information to us in order to enjoy
certain Services.</p>

<h2>How will Webmium websites and Applications on Webmium treat my
information?</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, we do not own or operate Webmium-enhanced
applications, Webmium websites and services. We take steps to
ensure that providers of Webmium -enhanced applications, Webmium
websites and services use information that you share on Webmium in
a manner consistent with your privacy settings and the terms of
this Privacy Policy, but we cannot guarantee that they will follow
our rules. Please take the time to familiarize yourself with the
privacy settings of your account, as well as the settings and
policies of the applications, Webmium sites and services that you
visit, add or use on Webmium. Here are some specific things to
remember:</p>

<p>By visiting or becoming a Member of a Webmium site on Webmium ,
the Content and information you provide during the registration
process (including your email address) and other interactions with
the Webmium website may be accessed by the Webmium site Creator and
their authorized representatives and administrators, as well as any
Application Developer whose Applications run on that Webmium
website.</p>

<p>By adding or using an Application or a service provided by one
of our affiliates or business partners, the information you provide
in the interactions with that Application or service may be
accessed by the respective Application Developer, affiliate or
business partner and their authorized representatives.</p>

<p>When you post information on a Webmium website, that information
is subject to that Webmium website's privacy settings and privacy
policy, which may change from time to time.</p>

<p>Publicly available information may be accessed by everyone on
the Internet, including third-party search engines that may index,
cache and store that information.</p>

<p>You should always review the policies of third party Webmium
websites, applications and services to make sure you are
comfortable with the ways in which they use information you share
with them. Any information you share with them is at your own risk.
If you find an application, Webmium website or service that
violates our rules, you should report the violation to us, and we
reserve the right to take action as we deem appropriate without
assuming any obligation or liability to do so.</p>

<h2 id="toc-what-are-cookies">What are cookies?</h2>

<p>Webmium may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser
files of your computer. These cookies help us make Webmium easier
to use, to make our advertising better, and to protect both you and
Webmium. For example, a cookie may be used to store or "remember"
your Member login information (but not your password) so that you
are not required to manually log into the site at every visit. You
can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but
in some cases that may impact your ability to use some of our
Services.</p>

<p>Our advertisers and partners may also set cookies through our
Services. For more information, please see the section "What about
third party advertisers and links?"</p>

<h2>Google Analytics</h2>

<p>Webmium.com uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service
provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses
"cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help
the website analyze how users use the site. The information
generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including
your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on
servers in the United States. Google will use this information for
the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling
reports on website activity for website operators and providing
other services relating to website activity and internet usage.
Google may also transfer this information to third parties where
required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the
information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP
address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use
of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser,
however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use
the full functionality of this website. By using this website, you
consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner
and for the purposes set out above.</p>

<h2>What about third party advertisers and links?</h2>

<p>In the course of serving advertisements on Webmium, a
third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on
your browser. Additionally, some links from Webmium may lead to
Webmium websites operated by other companies. While these Webmium
websites and advertisements may be co-branded with our name or
logo, they are not operated or maintained by us. We do not control
these cookies and users of Webmium Services should check the
privacy policy of the relevant advertiser to understand whether and
how it uses cookies. Webmium is not responsible for Webmium
websites operated by third parties that are linked to by any of our
sites. Ads appearing on this Webmium website, Webmium, and sites
hosted by Webmium may be delivered to you by Google Ad Manager,
DoubleClick, or other advertising partners. Information about your
visits to this site, such as the number of times you have viewed an
ad (but not your name, address or other personal information), is
used to serve ads to you.</p>

<h2>How secure is my information?</h2>

<p>Webmium uses commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and
procedural measures to safeguard personally identifiable
information in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized
use, disclosure or modification. We limit access to personal
information about you to employees whom we believe reasonably need
that information to provide support, products, or services to you
or to fulfill their roles within our organization.</p>

<p>Although we have established and maintain security procedures to
protect your personally identifiable information, please be aware
that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot
control the actions of other users with whom you share your
information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will
view your information. We cannot ensure that information you share
on Webmium will not become publicly available. We are not
responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy settings
or security measures on Webmium. You can reduce these risks by
using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong
password, using different passwords for different services, and
using up-to-date antivirus software.</p>

<p>Please <a href="mailto:privacy@webmium.com">report</a> any
security violations to us.</p>

<h2>How private is the Content I upload?</h2>

<p>Any Content uploaded or created using our Services and posted on
a Webmium website are by default hosted for the public and are thus
publicly accessible.</p>

<p>Please note that even if you do not publish links to Content or
submit links to a search engine, individuals or search engines may
discover and link to your Content by data-mining, guessing the
address, spidering sites, or other methods.</p>

<h2>What control do I have over my information?</h2>

<p>As a registered member, you may modify or update your personal
account information at any time by logging into your account and
(a) accessing the Settings area for each Webmium website you have
created, and (b) accessing the Manage Profile area for each Webmium
website you have joined by clicking on the corresponding Edit
Profile link on your Dashboard page. You may also remove the
Webmium website(s) you may have created on Webmium at any time by
logging into your account and clicking on the corresponding "Delete
Site" link on your Dashboard page. Should you desire to do so, you
may also delete and close your Webmium account at any time by <a href="mailto:webmium@webmium.com">contacting</a> us. Note that
removed or deleted information may persist in backup copies for a
reasonable period of time.</p>

<h2>How is information shared?</h2>

<p>Webmium will not share your personally identifiable information
with others except as described herein with regards to sharing with
Webmium -enhanced applications, Webmium websites and services and
in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is
reasonably necessary to offer the Services, legally required, or
permitted by you. For example, we may provide information to
service providers to help us bring you the services we offer.
Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business,
such as to host the Services at a co-location facility for servers,
to register your domain name, to send out email updates about
Webmium, to provide you with email functionality for your domain,
to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process
payments for products or services, or to provide search results or
links (including sponsored links). In connection with these
offerings and business operations, our service providers may have
access to your personal information for use for a limited time.</p>

<p>Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any
personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and
technical protections limiting the use of that information to the
Webmium-specified purposes. We may store personal information in
locations outside the direct control of Webmium (for instance, on
servers or databases co-located with hosting providers). Except as
otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose
personal information to any third party unless we believe that
disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to
respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process
received by Webmium , whether or not a response is required by
applicable law; (2) to enforce the <a href="http://www.webmium.com/en-US/terms">Webmium
Terms of Service</a> or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect
the safety or rights of members of the public or users of the
Services. Webmium reserves the right to transfer personal
information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that
information as a result of the sale of Webmium or substantially all
of its assets to that successor in interest. We may also transfer
such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers,
or dissolution.</p>

<h2>How am I notified of changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We may change this Privacy Policy pursuant to the procedures
outlined in our <a href="http://www.webmium.com/en-US/terms">Terms of Service</a>. Unless
stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all
information we have about you and your account. If we make changes
to this Privacy Policy we will notify you by publication here.</p>

<h2>Changes to this policy</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy may change. Of course, we will not reduce
your rights without your explicit consent. All of the Policy
changes will be posted on this page. If the changes are significant
we will provide a more significant notice (i.e. email
notification). If you don't agree with the changes of our privacy
statement, it is possible to beg to differ within one month. After
this period of time, the changes are considered to be accepted.
