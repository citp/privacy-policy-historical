            iEntry, Inc. Privacy Policy</span><br>
            Recognized by the industry for our commitment to safeguarding consumer 
            privacy on our Web site, we operate under a strict set of privacy 
            principles: 
            <p>The only information the iEntry Network obtains about individual 
              visitors to its Web site is information supplied voluntarily by 
              visitors.<br>
              <br>
              In cases when the iEntry Network may need personal information to 
              provide visitors with services tailored especially for them, or 
              to inform them about new features or services, visitors are asked 
              explicitly for that information. </p>
            <p>All identifiable information provided by members (name, email or 
              home address) will not be disclosed to anyone unless members specifically 
              request the iEntry Network to do so. </p>
            <p>Only statistical information of our members as a group (usage habits, 
              demographics) may be shared with any partner of the iEntry Network; 
              no identifiable information will be shared at any time. </p>
            <p>The iEntry Network employs strict security measures to safeguard 
              online transactions; personal information is stored in a secured 
              database and always sent via an encrypted Internet channel. </p>
            <p><span class="contentTextB">Delete/DeActivate Policy</span><br>
              Users may unsubscribe to any of our electronic newsletters at any 
              time by following the instructions contained at the end of every 
              newsletter. While all efforts are made to insure this information 
              is viewable in all email browsers, there may be cases where certain 
              email browsers do not display the unsubscribe information correctly. 
              In such cases subscribers may also adjust their subscriber settings 
              by logging into our Member Area at <a href="http://members.ientrymail.com/" class="contentTextB">http://members.ientrymail.com</a>. 
              If you are having problems unsubscribing please forward the entire 
              newsletter to <a href="mailto:abuse@ientry.com" class="contentTextB">abuse@ientry.com</a> 
              and you will be removed within 1 business day. Please note that 
              direct replies to any newsletter are processed by computer and are 
              not viewed by a human. To comment on a particular newsletter please 
              use the comments@ address included in the newsletter.</p>
            <p><span class="contentTextB">E-newsletter Privacy Policy</span><br>
              iEntry maintains a strict "no-spam" policy. Your information, 
              including your e-mail address will not be given to any third party 
              if you sign up for one of our newsletters. If you sign up for an 
              e-mail newsletter at an iEntry site, you will receive the e-mail 
              newsletter you have requested and our house newsletter eZined. eZined 
              promotes our new newsletter offerings and you can unsubscribe from 
              it at any time.</p>
            <p><span class="contentTextB">Advertising</span><br>
              iEntry newsletters may contain 3rd party advertising. As part of 
              your subscription, we may send out occasional special newsletter 
              issues featuring one of our advertising partners. Such issues will 
              generally feature some product or service that we believe will be 
              of interest to our subscribers. Instructions for unsubscribing from 
              these issues will be included with each mailing. You may decline 
              from receiving these special mailings and still continue to receive 
              our regular issues.</p>
            <p><span class="contentTextB">Polling</span><br>
              Several iEntry sites offer interactive polls to users so they can 
              easily share their opinions with other users and see what the iEntry 
              audience thinks about important issues. iEntry uses a system to 
              "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only 
              once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information 
              about individual users. </p>
            <p><span class="contentTextB">Surveys</span><br>
              Occasionally, iEntry conducts user surveys to better target our 
              content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic 
              information in these surveys with our advertisers and partners. 
              We never share any information about specific individuals with any 
              third party. </p>
            <p><span class="contentTextB">Submission</span><br>
              Our site submission guidelines are simple and straightforward. Multiple 
              submissions of the same site, site descriptions with embedded graphics 
              and/or javascript, pornographic site submissions and sites promoting 
              hatred, intolerance, or prejudice are not permitted and will be 
              deleted during or after our filtering process. Spamming the directory 
              is a waste of everyone's time. It entails considerable work on our 
              part to remove duplicate listings and consequently delays the posting 
              of legitimate submissions for a period of 4 to 5 weeks following 
              the date of submission.</p>
            <p><span class="contentTextB">Tracking .Gif’s</span><br>
              iEntry Inc. and its advertisers may use tracking or single-pixel 
              gif images to count Web page accesses and gather some general statistical 
              information. iEntry Inc. does not gather personal information through 
              the use of these images. Some advertisers may use tracking gifs 
              that can track personal information from cookies that may have been 
              previously placed on a user's computer.</p>
            <p><span class="contentTextB">Consent</span><br>
              By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of 
              information by iEntry Inc. as specified above. If we decide to change 
              our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that 
              you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use 
              it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. </p>
            <p>For additional detail regarding iEntry's site submission guidelines, 
              please visit our FAQ page.</p>
            <p><span class="contentTextB">How to Reach Us</span><br>
              If you ever feel uncertain about whether this site is following 
              the privacy policy we have described here, please notify us by e-mail 
              to <a href="mailto:abuse@ientry.com" class="contentTextB">abuse@ientry.com</a>. 
              We will make every reasonable effort to find and correct the problem 
              promptly.</p>
