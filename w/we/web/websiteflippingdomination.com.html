                  <p>PRIVACY POLICY Last Updated: July 26 
                  2009&nbsp;websiteflippingdomination strives to offer its visitors 
                  the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an 
                  interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally 
                  Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street 
                  address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this 
                  privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email 
                  address to any unauthorized third party. Period." How we 
                  gather information from users How we collect and store 
                  information depends on the page you are visiting, the 
                  activities in which you elect to participate and the services 
                  provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information 
                  when you register for access to certain portions of our site 
                  or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you 
                  make a purchase. You may provide information when you 
                  participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and 
                  chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like most 
                  Web sites, mafia business empire also collects information 
                  automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may 
                  be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the 
                  name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie 
                  technology to recognize you and hold information from your 
                  visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name 
                  and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that 
                  information each time you visit, or may control the number of 
                  times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting 
                  our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also 
                  gather information through other means. In certain cases, you 
                  can choose not to provide us with information, for example by 
                  setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you 
                  do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or 
                  may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we 
                  may not be able to customize the site’s features according to 
                  your preferences. What we do with the information we collect 
                  Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance 
                  your visit and deliver more individualized content and 
                  advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your 
                  information with anyone. Aggregated Information (information 
                  that does not personally identify you) may be used in many 
                  ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage 
                  patterns with similar information obtained from other users to 
                  help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages 
                  are visited most or what features are most attractive). 
                  Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our 
                  advertisers and business partners. Again, this information 
                  does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about 
                  you or allow anyone to identify you individually. We may use 
                  Personally Identifiable Information collected on 
                  websiteflippingdomination to communicate with you about your 
                  registration and customization preferences; our Terms of 
                  Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by 
                  websiteflippingdomination and other topics we think you might find 
                  of interest. Personally Identifiable Information collected by 
                  websiteflippingdomination may also be used for other purposes, 
                  including but not limited to site administration, 
                  troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, 
                  administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other 
                  communications with you. Certain third parties who provide 
                  technical support for the operation of our site (our Web 
                  hosting service for example) may access such information. We 
                  will use your information only as permitted by law. In 
                  addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our 
                  business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other 
                  companies or businesses. In such transactions, user 
                  information may be among the transferred assets. We may also 
                  disclose your information in response to a court order, at 
                  other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do 
                  so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you 
                  may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever 
                  we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not 
                  provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases. 
                  Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements 
                  websiteflippingdomination expects its partners, advertisers and 
                  affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, 
                  however, that third parties, including our partners, 
                  advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible 
                  through our site, may have their own privacy and data 
                  collection policies and practices. For example, during your 
                  visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame 
                  on a websiteflippingdomination page, certain content that is 
                  actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through 
                  websiteflippingdomination you may be introduced to, or be able to

                  sweepstakes offered by other parties. websiteflippingdomination is 
                  not responsible for the actions or policies of such third

                  those third parties when providing information on a feature or 
                  page operated by a third party. While on our site, our 
                  advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may 
                  use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of 
                  your preferences or retrieve information about you. For 
                  example, some of our advertising is served by third parties 
                  and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to 
                  determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement 
                  before. Other features available on our site may offer 
                  services operated by third parties and may use cookies or 
                  other technology to gather information. websiteflippingdomination
