            easier and more rewarding for you to use our services. Depending on 
            the service you are accessing, you could be asked at various times 
            to provide information such as your name, email address, or

              <li><b>Anonymous Information</b> refers to information that cannot 
              be tied back to a specific individual. For instance, we may know 
              that 10,000 people visit this Privacy Policy today, but we do not 
              necessarily know their names, where they live, or their date of 
              birth. What we collect from transactions such as this constitutes 
              anonymous information, much like how your hometown's bus service 
              knows how many people take a given route - but doesn't necessarily 
              know who those people are. Many of the individuals who access our 
              services decline to use the personalization features that are 
              available to them, and therefore those individuals are anonymous 
              to us and the data we collect is similarly anonymous information. 
              <p></p>
              </li><li><b>Personally Identifiable Information</b> refers to 
              information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your 
              name, phone number, or postal address. In many cases we need this 
              information to provide the personalized or enhanced service that 
              have requested. Examples of the use of such information would be <font size="-1">the
                Webshots Daily or </font>our award-winning "My Excite Start Page,"
                which uses your mailing

              scores; our commerce-enabled services, which allow our partners to 
              ship the products you buy to your door; or our free Excite Mail 
              email service, which uses your name as part of a security 
              mechanism to protect your messages from being read by anyone but 
              you. We hope that, like many of our customers, you will find it

            <p>Like you, we at the Excite@Home Network have children of our own 
            and are concerned about their safety when they use the Internet. We 
            want you and your family to be safe while visiting our Internet 
            sites. That is why we have established the following guidelines for 
            the way we interact with children when they access our services.
            </p><p>Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection 
            Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request <a href="privacy.html#info-type">Personally 
            Identifiable Information</a> from anyone under the age of 13 without 
            requesting verifiable parental consent. As a TRUSTe Premier Sponsor, 
            we will place a "Children's Seal" on any page directly targeted to 
            children under 13 that requests the disclosure of consumer 
            information, informing those children that parental consent is 
            needed, and we will use a secure and verifiable method for 
            confirmation of such consent.
            </p><p>Additionally, Excite@Home offers levels of protection for minors 
            that are beyond what either TRUSTe or federal law requires. While 
            Excite@Home will not target registration to those under 13 without 
            using the safeguards listed above, we recognize that some minors 
            will utilize the registration products associated with our general 
            release products. If a customer registers with us and their birth 
            date indicates that they are not just under 13, but are in fact any 
            age less than 18, we will:
            </p><p>
            </p><ol>
              <li>Never knowingly send a copy of a mass emailing to them, even 
              if they gave us permission to email them during registration.
              <p></p>
              </li><li>Never voluntarily share their customer information with any 
              third party, even if they gave us permission to share their 
              customer information during registration.
              <p></p>
              </li><li>Never list them in any Member Directory in a manner in which 
              their age can be easily identified.
              <p></p></li></ol>The only exceptions to the above policies regarding 
            data collected from minors will be for bona fide non-profit 
            organizations that offer outreach and support to children. In cases 
            where minors have volunteered information in the context of a 
            cobranded peer counseling or mentoring environment on an Excite@Home 
            Network domain, this information will be shared with that cobranded 
            non-profit organization. An example of such a bona fide non-profit 
            organization would be the outstanding <a href="http://shine.excite.com/">SHINE</a> organization (Seeking 
            Harmony in Neighborhoods Everywhere) that Excite@Home supports.
            <p>In summary, the management and employees of Excite@Home are very 
            proud of our industry-leading steps to safeguard the privacy of all 
            minors online. We're doing what we can to ensure that <a href="privacy.html#info-type">Personally 
            Identifiable Information</a> regarding registered users under the 
            age of 18 won't leave our company for commercial use; and that 
            someone using our site won't be able to easily look up their age. 
            These protections are a start, but there are some actions we cannot 
            control, and in these areas we need help from the child's parent or 
            guardian as well. For instance, we cannot stop a minor from giving 
            their age in our unmoderated online chat sessions - but parents or 
            guardians can counsel their children against taking such actions. 
            For more information about protecting the privacy and safety of 
            minors online, we recommend that you visit the <a href="http://www.truste.org/users/users_privacy_links.html#parents">Parents

            unsolicited junk email is referred to as "Spam." Nearly all of us at 
            one time or another will find Spam in our email inboxes. Sadly, 
            there is no current solution to completely prevent the delivery of 
            Spam although our Excite Mail team is constantly working on 
            solutions that help. Your email address can become available to 
            "Spammers" in any number of ways. You may have entered your email 
            address at a non-Excite@Home Web site where you signed up for a 
            product or service. Or maybe you posted a message to a discussion

            automatically plucked by disreputable firms. Or, you might have done 
            nothing at all. Unfortunately, some Spammers send massive amounts of 
            email to various Internet domains, including ours and those run by 
            companies such as Yahoo!® or AOL®. These individuals target large 
            lists of probable email names (like "John") and the resultant email

            horribly inefficient, they are a common practice that allow Spammers 
            to get mail out to people who have not provided their names or 
            addresses. Your best bet is simply to delete such email from your 
            inbox if you find any.
            <p>Regrettably, all of us are victims of this behavior. Excite@Home 
            does not condone these activities and is active in pursuing 
            solutions, including supporting the development of new laws and 
            regulations to stem email Spamming. Excite@Home is not responsible 
            for this unfortunate activity, and largely cannot stop it from 
            occurring when it originates from domains off of the Excite@Home 
            Network. We can and will, however, take actions against Excite@Home 
            users who utilize any of our email products as the launching pad for 
            Spam directed towards others, whether those prospective Spam 
            recipients be Excite@Home customers or not. Sending Spam from any 
            Excite@Home domain is a serious breach of our <a href="http://www.excite.com/terms.html">Terms of Service</a> that 
            can lead to immediate closure of the sender's account.
            </p><p>Finally, Excite@Home does occasionally send outbound email 
            communications to our customers - and we hope you never think of it 
            as Spam. To ensure that this is the case, we have strong policies in 
            place that allow our customers to control the delivery of this 
            content, or to prevent it altogether if that is your preference. For 
            information about the controls that we make available to you, please

            are electing to use a paid service that requires you to supply 
            certain information to establish the billing relationship. For 
            instance, your name, address, phone number, and potentially your 
            credit card number must be provided to initiate service. That 
            information is only available to authorized Excite@Home personnel 
            for installing, maintaining, and billing the Excite@Home service.
            </p><p>When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such as 
            Netscape Navigator® or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically 
            transmits some information to Excite@Home every time you access 
            content on one of our sites, whether accessing it from the 
            Excite@Home cable Internet access service or through another 
            Internet Service Provider (ISP). Examples of such information 
            include the URL of the Web page you were just on (known as the 
            "Refer"), the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you 
            are using, or the browser version you are using to access our site. 
            All of this information is collected by Excite@Home and is used to 
            help improve our offerings to you. For instance, from this 
            information we determined that few of our customers use older 
            browser versions. Because of this we recently decided to enhance the 
            quality of content available to all of our customers by using the 
            advanced features of HTML that cannot be accessed from those older 
            browser versions. All of the information that is automatically 
            submitted to us by your browser is considered <a href="privacy.html#info-type">Anonymous 
            Information</a>.
            </p><p>To enable many of the features available within the Excite@Home 
            Network, we will assign "cookies" to your Internet browser (such as 
            Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer). A cookie is a 
            small text file that contains a unique identification number stored 
            on your computer. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out 
            the identity of any user. This unique identification number 
            automatically identifies your browser - but not you - to our 
            computers whenever you interact on one of our Internet domains. When 
            you visit our site, a cookie in effect says to our server computers 
            "Hello, I'm browser #655. What do you do just for me?" Every Web 
            page that you access that includes advertising or content served 
            from the Excite@Home Network will have the contents of your cookie 
            reported in our server logs. But only when you agree to provide <a href="privacy.html#info-type">Personally 
            Identifiable Information</a> directly to an <a href="http://www.excite.com/privacy_policy/domains.html">Excite@Home 
            branded service</a>, such as through registration, will we be able 
            to know anything about you other than the random number that our 
            server computers originally assign to your browser.
            </p><p>There is a lot of confusion about cookies, how they are used, and 
            what they can do. Cookies only contain information that the server 
            computer "knew" in the first place, and can only be read by the 
            serving domain that placed them. For instance, Yahoo! utilizes 
            cookies, but Excite@Home's servers can't read their contents nor can 
            Yahoo!'s servers read ours. Cookies are an essential part of how the 
            Internet works today, and allow server computers to recognize your 
            computer's browser when you return. If you have ever gone to a Web 
            page that automatically provides personalized content without you 
            having to "sign in," such as your own stock portfolio, this is 
            almost certainly being accomplished with a cookie. Since cookies are 
            only text files, they cannot "run" on your computer and have no 
            ability to search your computer for other information, or transmit 
            it to anyone.
            </p><p>Cookies are part of the technology implemented by your Web 
            browser. But don't just take our word for it - read what the 
            companies who wrote the browsers have to say!

            </a><p><a name="used">Our services have been designed to enable Excite@Home to provide 
            personalized content to those customers who wish to receive it. The 
            majority of the services that are provided for free through the 
            Excite@Home Network are the result of advertising revenues. Our 
            ability to provide enhanced services and content to our customers is 
            dependent on our ability to provide venues for our advertising 
            partners that reach specific demographic segments of our customer 
            base. Generally, advertisers have little interest in reaching a 
            specific customer of our services - and as a matter of policy we 
            provide no mechanism for an advertiser to reach you or any other 
            specific customer unless you request that contact. Instead, our 
            advertising partners have the need to reach customers who share 
            common demographic characteristics such as a specific gender or age 
            range. For instance, certain products are more often purchased by 
            men then by women and therefore when advertising those products, in 
            this example the advertiser would prefer to target their messages 
            just to men. The better job Excite@Home does in providing a 
            mechanism for advertisers to reach specific sub-segments of our 
            users, the more revenue we can generate from advertising and that 
            ultimately is what allows you the consumer to get to the wealth of 
            free content that is available on Excite@Home's various services. 
            Importantly, at no time is your </a><a href="privacy.html#info-type">Personally 
            Identifiable Information</a> used to determine what advertising you 
            receive nor do we use it to determine what type of advertising any 
            other customer of Excite@Home will receive.
            </p><p>Below is a description of the uses of the information that we 
            collect and how our visitors and advertisers benefit from these 
            action:
            </p><p>
            </p><ol>
              <li>We provide personalized content in the form of news, 
              horoscopes, advertisements, weather reports, stock portfolios, 
              movies, television listings, and more to our Members.
              <p></p>
              </li><li>We pay attention to what our customers do and do not use on 
              our service and modify our content appropriately.
              <p></p>
              </li><li>We match the patterns of usage that our consumers exhibit on 
              any Web site where we serve advertising - over 2,000 distinct 
              Internet domains - to create "imputed profiles" about our 
              anonymous customers. The creation of an imputed profile allows the 
              Excite@Home Network to statistically model the demographic 
              characteristics of an otherwise anonymous customer, without ever 
              knowing that anonymous customer's name or any other <a href="privacy.html#info-type">Personally 
              Identifiable Information</a> about them. These imputed profiles 
              are used to target advertising - primarily banners - to those 
              anonymous customers, both on <a href="http://www.excite.com/privacy_policy/domains.html">Excite@Home 
              Network domains</a> and any of the other Internet domains where we 
              serve advertising.
              <p>Through the use of imputed profiles, Excite@Home can surface 
              advertising to our customers that is more likely to be for 
              products they would want, and sell that advertising in the 
              marketplace for a higher price. This is essential to our ability 
              to provide high quality content to our customers for free. 
              Excite@Home never matches "Who you are" with "Where you've been" 
              on the Internet because we do not use personal data 
              characteristics such as your name, address or phone number to 
              create these imputed profiles but rather use primary demographic 
              characteristics such as your age or gender. Finally, imputed 
              profiles present no privacy risk to our customers because they are 
              worthless to third parties; since any potential third party would 
              be unable to read the cookies that we set on our domains, only 
              Excite@Home can create value from these imputed profiles.
              </p><p></p>
              </li><li>We provide advertisements that support our customers' specific 
              requests for information through keyword searches and editorial 
              content. Do a search on "cars," for instance, and you'll usually 
              see a banner advertisement from an automobile company.
              <p></p>
              </li><li>We develop summary - but not individual - reports for our 
              advertisers. An example of a summary report might be "12,000 
              people clicked on Advertisement 'X' today, and of those people, 
              35% had previously indicated they had an interest in sports." Our 
              advertisers, who make it possible for you to use Excite@Home for 
              free, need this information to determine how effective their 
              advertising investments are. We never tell our advertisers who it 
              was that saw or clicked on their advertisements, unless you have 
              specifically told us it is acceptable to do so.
              <p></p>
              </li><li>If you enter a sweepstakes or a contest, we'll use the 
              information you supplied to contact you. We'll probably also 
              congratulate you!
              <p></p>
              </li><li>Through our DeliverE email service, we will send registrants 
              of the Excite@Home Network outbound email communications on 
              information we think they will find useful, including information 
              about new products and services from selected partners. It is our 
              policy to never send messages to Members who have asked us not to 
              do so, either at initial registration or later through an 
              unsubscribe process. In every email from any company or Web site 
              of the Excite@Home Network, we will remind you of your option to 
              change your preferences regarding receipt of future email 
              communications. Please see the information about <a href="privacy.html#info">unsubscribing

              information.
              <p></p>
              </li><li>Finally, if we believe that Excite@Home property or an 
              individual's safety or security is at risk, we will disclose this 
              information to proper court or law enforcement agencies.

            </p><p>Other companies that place advertising on our site may collect 
            information about you when you view or click on their advertising or 
            content through the use of cookies (using the same techniques as 
            described <a href="privacy.html#collected">above</a>). 
            Due to the way the Internet technically operates, we cannot control 
            this collection of information - but we can control which companies 
            are allowed to place such advertising on our site. Excite@Home is 
            leading the creation of industry standards of acceptable practice 
            for what is known as "Third party ad serving," and once these 
            standards are established will only accept advertising from third 
            party firms that adhere to those rules of conduct. In the interim, 
            as the consumer you should contact these advertisers or content 
            providers that place information on the Excite@Home Network directly 
            if you have any questions about their use of the information they 
            potentially collect. It should be noted that anyone placing 
            advertising on our Web sites can only collect <a href="privacy.html#info-type">Anonymous 
            Information</a> about you unless you actively provide <a href="privacy.html#info-type">Personally 
            Identifiable Information</a> to them.
            </p><p>Information that you provide while using products such as Excite 
            Message Boards and Excite Chat is available for all to see. 
            Discretion should be used in entering <a href="privacy.html#info-type">Personally 
            Identifiable Information</a> within such forums, as it may be 
            collected by third parties, and this is, for instance, a leading 
            source of unwanted email <a href="privacy.html#spam">Spam</a>. 
            The Excite@Home Network does not actively associate the message 
            content entered by our customers in Excite Mail, Excite Message 
            Boards, or Excite Chat products with those customers' registration 
            information. Our server computers will retain this information, 
            however; and it is potentially available for distribution to third 
            parties - most obviously law-enforcement agencies acting under 
            subpoena power, per the terms of this section of our Privacy Policy. 
            We do not use this information to target any advertising to our 
            customers, nor is it ever willingly distributed to any third party, 
            such as an advertiser, except if subpoenaed.
            </p><p>And finally, the Excite@Home Network does not control the 
            information collection and distribution policies on Internet domains 
            other than those <a href="http://www.excite.com/privacy_policy/domains.html">Excite@Home 
            Network Internet domains</a> that are part of the Excite@Home 
            Network itself. We do, however, encourage our co-branding partners 
            to adopt privacy policies similar to this one and to become 
            licensees of TRUSTe, and we have been relatively successful to date 
            in gaining coverts: Look for the TRUSTe logo wherever you go on the 
            Internet!

            <p>The Excite@Home Network does offer you the ability to control the

            word on whether Excite@Home - or any Internet company - knows who 
            you are. It is your choice to share </a><a href="privacy.html#info-type">Personally 
            Identifiable Information</a> with Excite@Home and we encourage you 
            to consider only sharing information with any site on the Internet

            and if you respect the privacy practices of the firm.
            </p><p>If you do choose to share <a href="privacy.html#info-type">Personally 
            Identifiable Information</a> with Excite@Home, you can control 
            whether we contact you or share the information with third parties, 
            either through declarations you make at the time you share 
            information with us, or through updates to your information in the 
            <a href="http://members.excite.com/private_profile/">Excite@Home 
            Member Services area</a>. Any time information is requested from you 
            on an <a href="http://www.excite.com/privacy_policy/domains.html">Excite@Home 
            Network Internet domain</a>, you should see a TRUSTe logo that links 
            to our Privacy Policy and a clear indication of what your 
            information distribution choices are. Excite@Home will always give 
            you a chance to unsubscribe to any email communication from us - 
            clear directions for doing so will appear in any email message we 
            send to you.
            </p><p>At times, the Excite@Home Network may enter into cobranding 
            arrangements with other companies, and if so, an opt-in question may 
            be present for contact from these firms as well. Their opt-out 
            features are specific to each organization, but you should never 
            receive email from these organizations unless you have indicated 
            that it is acceptable. All email from the Excite@Home Network, or 
            from cobrand partners who gain your permission to send you 
            commercial email, will include an opportunity to opt out of future 
            communications.
            </p><p>The Excite@Home Network does reserve the right to send a one-time 
            registration confirmation email, and infrequent Service Alert 
            messages to its customers to inform them of specific changes that 
            may impact their ability to use a service they have previously 
            signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status. An example 
            of a Service Alert message would be notification of the impending 
            closing of an account that is believed to be abandoned. 
            Additionally, Excite@Home reserves the right to send its broadband 
            cable service customers periodic postal mail and/or email regarding 
            administrative topics, for example, changes in pricing or operating 
            policies. And finally, we also reserve the right to contact you if 
            compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has 
            been a violation of our <a href="http://www.excite.com/terms.html">Terms of Service</a>. 
            Excite@Home is retaining these rights because in limited cases we 
            feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or 
            regarding matters which will be important to you. These rights do 
            not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if 
            you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of 
            communications are rare.
