# Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting [http://www.WEbook.com](http://www.webook.com/) (together with all content on the site and other websites operated by WEbook Inc. or its affiliates ("WEbook") (the "Site")). Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this Site. This Privacy Policy is part of the WEbook [Terms of Use and Member Agreement ("Agreement")](https://web.archive.org/web/20161031192804id_/http%3A//www.webook.com/termsofuse.aspx), which is a binding agreement between all Members of the Site and WEbook. The defined terms in the Agreement have the same meaning in this Privacy Policy.

Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on the Site and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, at WEBook’s discretion for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). Each version of the Privacy Policy will be identified by its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.

The current version of the Privacy Policy is available at [http://www.WEbook.com/privacy.aspx](https://web.archive.org/web/20161031192804id_/http%3A//www.webook.com/privacy.aspx).

## The Way We Use Personal Information

If you submit Personal Information to us through the Site, we will use your Personal Information to improve our services to you, to contact you and to identify and authenticate your access to the Site's services you are authorized to use.

Your Pen name and any content you make, place or post on the Site may become publicly available.

We may transfer your Personal Information within WEbook or to WEbook's third-party service providers, but only to provide services on the Site or to you, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.

If you approve in advance or if you use your real name as you pen name, WEbook may use and display your real name on the Site.

The Agreement also has provisions about how WEbook may use your Personal Information in connection with publishing Content, crediting a Member’s authorship of Content, registering copyrights in Content, and other purposes related to Company’s business.

We may provide Personal Information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf.

## Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

Some of our Site pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about Site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Site user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.

You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter certain identifying information, should we in the future require such information, to gain access to certain parts of the Site.

Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our Site is accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our Site and your web experience.

## Notice

Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not currently provide your Personal Information to third parties, except for third parties who may perform services on the Site or to you. Nevertheless, we may at a later time choose to make certain offers or services available to our users from third parties. If we do, during the registration process and at certain points thereafter in connection with specific offers, we may ask you whether your Personal Information may be sent to third parties who have products, services and opportunities which may be useful to you. If you give your permission to allow third parties to contact you, your Personal Information (such as your contact information and other information collected during your visit to our Site) may be shared with data aggregators, marketers (possibly in the form of list rental), and other organizations. WEbook does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on WEbook's behalf unless such transfer is legally required. Regardless of your decision regarding the sharing of your Personal Information, we may share broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information with our business partners. This aggregate information does not contain any Personal Information that can identify an individual user.

## Choice

You may choose whether or not to provide certain Personal Information to WEbook. The notices we will provide where WEbook collects Personal Information on the Site should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of the Site, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you.

## Security

We have implemented suitable security policies, rules and technical measures to protect and safeguard the Personal Information under our control from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification, unlawful destruction or accidental loss. All our employees and data processors that have access to, and are associated with the processing of your Personal Information, are obliged to respect the confidentiality of your information.

## Access/Accuracy

## Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites

Our Site may use a reputable third party to present or serve advertisements that you may see at our Site. These third party ad servers may use cookies, web beacons, clear gifs or similar technologies to help present such advertisements, and to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness. The use of these technologies by these third party ad servers is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by our Privacy Policy.

Our Site may contain links to other sites. Other sites may also reference or link to our Site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other sites.

## Children's Privacy

The Site is not structured to attract children under the age of 13. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 13 years of age.

## In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy

In the event that WEbook is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the Personal Information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your Personal Information is treated, transferred, or used.
