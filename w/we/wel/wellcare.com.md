Well Care Health Plan maintains standards for the protection of privacy over the Internet. This statement is intended to explain the types of information Well Care Health Plan may obtain about visitors to our Web site and how the information is used.

The only information Well Care Health Plan obtains about individual visitors to our Web site is information supplied voluntarily by the visitor. This means your visit to our Web site does not require you to tell us who you are or reveal any information about yourself.

You can choose to provide individually identifiable information to Well Care Health Plan through our Web site by making a purchase at the Well Care Store, submitting a change of address, requesting a new ID Card, selecting a new primary care physician, sending us e-mail, registering to receive news Webzine, reporting insurance fraud or applying for a job. When visitors supply information about themselves for a specific purpose, Well Care Health Plan uses the information for that purpose only (such as to provide the information the visitor has requested or to consider a visitor for a particular job). In addition, when visitors use our Web site to place an order, submit a change or to request information, we may use the identifiable information as we would use the same information obtained offline for example, to request a change of a primary care physician.

We do not sell or disclose information obtained online about our visitors, to anyone outside of Well Care Health Plan unless law requires it, or disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees or property.

Well Care Health Plan does not transmit unsolicited "junk" e-mail (spam). We may use e-mail to communicate with our members, providers and employers to respond to visitors' e-mails, to confirm orders placed online, and to send requested information. If unwanted e-mail is received from us, please reply and ask that we no longer send future e-mails (simply type "remove" in the body of your reply).

Well Care Health Plan is committed to privacy on our site. We require our employees to protect the privacy of information about our customers and expect our providers and partners to do so as well. You can feel confident that information will be protected when you access your account information or order from us over the Internet.

Well Care Health Plan strives to ensure that the information we obtain and use is accurate. To that end, we strive to verify that our customer records are correct. If you find an error, please let us know, Well Care Health Plan's Member Services Representatives are trained to answer any questions about the information obtained about you, including how to correct any inaccuracies in that information.

The Well Care Health Plan Web site may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices they employ.

To improve the services Well Care can offer you, Well Care Health Plan may opt to expand its capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future. Well Care Health Plan will update this privacy statement continually to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.

Well Care Health Plan has adopted privacy ethics that state our commitment and define our policy safeguarding customer privacy.
