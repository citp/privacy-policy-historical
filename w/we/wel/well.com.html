<a id="privacy"> </a>
<p><b>Privacy policy</b></p>

<p>The Well Group respects your right to the privacy of the 
personal information you provide for the purposes of registration 
and payment. The WELL is a non-anonymous community site. We 
ask registered members to make their real names and working 
email addresses known to each other when logged in to our system 
and communicating with one another.</p>

<p>We seek to provide this non-anonymous social environment while
treating your privacy with respect and care.  To that end, 
unless you designate otherwise or we state otherwise in this 
policy or at the time information is collected, with the 
exception of sharing your real name and your provided off-system 
email address as described, any personal information you provide 
to The Well Group will be known only to you, and to authorized 
staff, trusted partner services and contractors providing The WELL 
services on behalf of The Well Group. We will not disclose or 
confirm the fact of your membership by name to non-members 
without your permission, except in specific situations such as 
to law enforcement agencies or contractors such as our credit 
card processing partners as specified in this document. </p> 

<p>The following policy is intended to explain how personal
information provided by you, along with the personally 
identifiable access data your browser or similar application 
provides to our servers and applications, will be treated as 
you make use of our services and their features. Personal 
information includes your street address, billing information 
and any other personal identification information you may 
provide at the behest of The Well Group. Personally identifiable 
access data is collected by applications on our servers from your 
Web browser or other Internet access application.</p>

<p>This policy may change from time to time, with announcement 
and discussion in The WELL forum area known as the Policy 
Conference (Members may go there by using the shortcut: <strong>g policy</strong>). 
Please check there periodically. </p>

<p>The Well Group is not the first organization to offer the 
services of The WELL. In the unlikely event that The Well Group 
or any of its services is acquired by or merged with another 
company, we will transfer the personal information about you 
along with the service.  The Well Group will notify you with 
more information before any such event. </p>

<a id="announcements"> </a>
<p><b>Announcements and spam</b></p>

<p>From time to time, members may receive notification of new 
services, changes to policies, major business announcements or 
price adjustments.  We will not send you other email at the 
address you provide during registration, except for infrequent 
communications to resolve issues that may arise with your own 
WELL account.</p>

<p>Your ability to retrieve a lost password relies on your provided
offsite email. Most routine announcements are made in The WELL
Newsletter Conference (<strong>g news</strong>) rather than via email.  The Well 
Group will not rent or provide commercial use of either your 
offsite or well.com email address to any third party.</p>

<p>From time to time, we may make your personal information visible 
to trusted partners who work on behalf of The Well Group under
confidentiality agreements. These partner companies do not have 
any independent right to communicate with you, nor to share your
information with others. The offsite email address you provide 
during registration will also be made available to your fellow members 
of the service for the purposes of personal communication. Any 
alternative offsite email addresses that you add for billing or staff 
contact purposes after registration will be kept confidential.</p>   

<p>We do not permit the use of well.com email accounts for sending
unsolicited bulk commercial email.</p>
 
<a id="traffic"> </a>
<p><b>Traffic data</b></p>

<p>Each time a visitor comes to The WELL, some basic technical
information is collected.  For example, software logs the date 
and time of the connection, what browser you use, where you 
are connecting from (your IP address), and, in some cases, 
where you were just prior to visiting The WELL.  When members
are logged in, some of this information is made available to 
other members. This automatically available information 
on fellow logged-in members is limited to dates, times, and, 
in some cases, the IP address and host name of your computer 
system.</p>

<p>We also count, track and aggregate each visitor's activity into our
analysis of general traffic flows at The WELL. To these ends, we may
merge information about membership levels and activity into group
data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis, but we will 
not disclose your individual identity as a WELL member nor will we 
share your personally identifiable access data outside the service 
without your permission. If we do present any form of aggregated 
information to outside parties beyond our trusted partners, no one 
will be able to identify you or contact you. </p>

<p>We do not release aggregated data for individual Private Conferences.</p>

<a id="cookies"> </a>
<p><b>Use of cookies</b></p>

<p>A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a
Web server and stored in your computer's memory or written on your
computer's hard drive. For example, we use cookies to allow the system
to know you have already entered a password each time you click for
more data in a conference login session. We also use cookies in the
Google Analytics format to help us understand how our Web pages
perform.  We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to
better understand how you interact with our services, to monitor
aggregate usage and web traffic patterns on our services, and to
customize and improve our services.</p>

<p>Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct
your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or
to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
However, some services may not function properly if you disable
cookies. Our cookies do not contain your password, or any of the
personal billing or contact information you provide to us when you
register for a membership in The WELL. </p>

<a name="participants"> </a>
<p><b>Participants</b></p>

<p>WELL members are expected to comply with our Member Agreement, 
but The Well Group cannot control third parties' use of information 
you may choose to provide via a post to any online conference, 
email list, chat or send tool or any other communication environment 
within or from our services. The Well Group cannot vouch for the 
integrity of the participants you may communicate with, including but 
not limited to participants in Private Conference areas. Sharing 
information with other members is a matter of individual choice 
and judgment. If you choose to take part in any WELL conference, 
whatever you may disclose in that discussion area is made known 
to other current or future WELL members who may read the 
conference.  The conferencing software that The Well Group 
provides to members will keep track of what you have seen in 
order to show you new material when you return.  This information 
about when you were last present is available to other members 
of the service in the conferences to which you have mutual access 
so that it is easier to tell who is up to date in a group
conversation. </p>

<p>We do not provide this information on members' participation and 
activity to non-members.</p>

<p>We offer "shell" access with some of our membership plans.  Shell
(command line) users are responsible for learning how UNIX permissions
work in order to avoid unintentionally leaving files readable by
others, or having the commands they execute viewed by other.  A shared
UNIX environment is by definition geared more towards sharing than
privacy. We also offer a Web interface to our primary services.</p>

<p>All of our services are offered "as is."  Shell usage is not required
of members.</p>

<a id="billing"> </a>
<p><b>Billing Information</b></p>

<p>In order to subscribe, members provide The Well Group with
personal information including a telephone number, contact 
and billing street addresses and credit card account 
information. The Well Group goes to great lengths to keep all 
such information strictly confidential.  Billing information is 
submitted to our payment industry partner companies in order to 
process credit cards in accordance with strict banking data 
security standards. The Well Group will not share your personal 
payment information except as required to securely process your 
membership payments, or as otherwise described in this document. 
This information is not available to other members of The WELL 
unless you disclose it to them.</p>

<a id="surveys"> </a>
<p><b>Surveys</b></p>

<p>The Well Group may from time to time conduct voluntary surveys 
of visitors to the site to obtain aggregate preferences or 
demographic information about them. Such information will be 
compiled and may be shared in the aggregate to discuss business 
opportunities with third parties, but no personal details will 
be traceable or associated with specific individuals who 
participate in surveys.</p>

<a id="children"> </a>
<p><b>Our commitment to children's privacy</b></p>

<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is important to us. 
For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information at 
our sites from those we actually know are under 13, and no 
part of our sites are structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>


<a id="other"> </a>
<p><b>Other disclosure of personal information</b></p>

<p>The Well Group will not otherwise use or disclose your personal
information without your consent except (i) as described in this
privacy policy, or (ii) in order to investigate, prevent or take
action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations 
involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, 
or as otherwise required by law.</p>
 
<p>Notification of such inquiries will be emailed to such members 
before or as soon as is practical after disclosures are made, 
unless such notification is prohibited by law or court order.</p>

<p>This privacy policy does not protect information you voluntarily
disclose to others, including officers of the law, via a post to 
any online conference, email list, chat or send tool or any 
other services within or from The WELL.</p>

<a id="cancellation"> </a>
<p><b>Cancellation and data removal policies</b></p>

<p>If you end your membership, you may contact Helpdesk [at] well.com 
to request removal of your personal contact data. At your 
request, we will delete any billing and personal contact data 
other than any such information you may have chosen to post, 
mail or otherwise share with others, and that we are not required 
to retain for accounting purposes. If you wish to delete any of 
your own conference posts before ending your membership, you 
may do so yourself while your account remains active.</p>

<a id="sites"> </a>
<p><b>Other sites</b></p>

<p>The WELL sites and services contain many links to other 
Internet sites. The Well Group cannot control and is not 
responsible for the privacy practices or content of other Web 
sites, even if those sites are produced by WELL members or 
reside within our <strong>www.well.com/user</strong> area.</p>

<a id="info"> </a>
<p><b>For further information; contacts</b></p>

<p>If you have any further questions or concerns about The Well 
Group's privacy policies and use of personal information, 
please email them to helpdesk [at] well.com, or post them to 
The WELL Policy Conference (the shortcut is <strong>g policy</strong>).</p>
