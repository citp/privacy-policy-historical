**ARTICLE 1**

**What This Privacy Policy Covers**

This Privacy Policy applies only to the Wellness.com web site ("Site"). Some of the links on our Site connect to other web sites. Once you leave our Site and enter another web site (whether through an advertisement, co-brand, service, or content link), be aware any information you disclose on or through those sites is not subject to this Privacy Policy. Wellness.com does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices of the third party web sites to which we link. You should always review the privacy policy for those sites to understand how they treat your Personal Information. 

Within the Site, this Privacy Policy applies only to the information described below. If you enrolled for any of Wellness.coms Subscription Services, please review the applicable provisions of the separate Subscriber Agreement, as well as the Wellness.com Web Site Use Agreement, to understand how we treat the patient information you enter when using those services. 

**ARTICLE 2**

**Information We Collect**

 _Registration and Profile_

Personal Information is information that can be used to identify or contact you. You may use our Site without submitting Personal Information. By providing us with personal information, you consent to our use of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In some cases, we provide this information to third parties. We may also use this information to contact you or send you emails or flash messages with special promotions or with content that we think may be of interest to you or to ask you to participate in a survey. 

_Cookies_

We may collect anonymous, non-Personal Information about your use of our Site through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small computer files that we transfer to your computer's hard drive that allow us to know how often someone visits our Site and the activities they conduct while on our site (such as the chat rooms visited, etc.). Every computer is assigned a different cookie by Wellness.com. The information collected by cookies can help us dynamically generate advertising and content on web pages specifically designed for you and also allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our site and for what purpose. Cookies also help us authenticate our users. 

Your browser software can be set to reject all cookies. However, you must at least allow for session-based cookies to use our Site. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar. 

Sponsors, partners, advertisers, or other third parties on Wellness.com may also use their own cookies when you click on their advertisement or link to their site or service. Some advertisers use companies other than Wellness.com to serve their ads and these companies ("Ad Servers") may also collect non-Personal Information through the use of cookies on our Site. We do not control these third parties' use of cookies, or how they manage the non-Personal Information they gather through them. However, we do require Ad Servers to agree that they will not collect any Personal Information from our Site without your consent and to agree they will not link any non-personal cookie information collected by them from our Site to Personal Information they or others collect in other ways or from other sites. You should review the privacy policy of other sites you visit or link to from our Site to understand how these other sites use cookies and how they use the information they collect through the use of cookies on their own sites. 

_Public Forums_

This Privacy Policy does not protect you when you use any Wellness.com discussion groups or public forums. As a service to our users, Wellness.com may feature bulletin boards or online discussions. Any information shared in a bulletin board or online discussion is public information and may be seen or collected by third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy Policy. You should think carefully before disclosing any Personal Information in any public forum. 

**ARTICLE 3**

**Disclosure of Your Information**

Except as set forth in this Article or as specifically agreed to by you, Wellness.com will not disclose any Personal Information it gathers from you on our Site. We may release Personal Information to third parties: (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (2) in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others. In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose your Personal Information to a third party, we will notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court order. 

_Disclosure for Marketing Purposes_

Wellness.com may disclose your Registration Information to its marketing and sales staff and/or to the sales staffs of other companies with which Wellness.com has joint marketing arrangements, such as practice management companies, for the purpose of contacting you to offer additional services in which we think you may be interested. 

_Disclosure in the Context of Linked Web Sites_

Wellness.com will not disclose your Personal Information to the owners and operators of web sites linked to our Site. Please remember that this Privacy Policy no longer applies once you leave our Site and enter a linked third party web site. 

_Disclosure of Aggregate Information_

Wellness.com may provide to third parties non-Personal Information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted and that is combined with the non-Personal Information of other users ("Aggregate Information"). For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of users of our Site and the activities they conduct while on our Site. Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties for this Aggregate Information. We also may not limit the third parties use of the Aggregate Information, except that we do require third parties to whom we disclose Aggregate Information to agree that they will not attempt to make this information personally identifiable by combining it with other databases or otherwise. 

**ARTICLE 4**

**Your Privacy Choices**

At various times as you use the Site, you may have the option of receiving informational/promotional emails or newsletters from Wellness.com and/or third parties participating in research or marketing surveys and participating in other activities. You may exercise these options by placing or leaving in place a check mark beside a statement that expresses a preference for receiving these communications or participating in these activities. 

Also, when you have received a newsletter you wish to stop, click on the "UNSUBSCRIBE" link at the bottom of the email to automatically have your information removed from our that newsletter's database of recipients. Your information will be removed immediately upon your completion of the automated unsubscribe process. 

**ARTICLE 5**

**Updating Your Personal Information and Contacting Wellness.com**

You can always contact us in order to (1) delete your Personal Information or (2) update the Personal Information that you have provided to us by emailing us at [support@wellness.com](mailto:support@wellness.com). Such changes will not have any effect on other information that Wellness.com maintains. You may not delete your Personal Information if you wish to continue access to the Site and/or our Subscription Services. 

It is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to Wellness.com from our servers. The need to back-up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your Personal Information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Nevertheless, we promise that upon receiving your request, all Personal Information stored in the databases we actively use for research and daily business activities, and other readily searchable media, will be deleted. 

Privacy as it applies to the Internet is a dynamic, rapidly developing area. In the future, we may make significant changes to our privacy policy affecting the use of the Personal Information we collect. We will notify you by email of any significant changes and obtain your "opt-in" consent to any significant new uses of your Personal Information, if it was collected from you prior to a significant change in this policy. We may also make non-significant changes to our Privacy Policy that generally will not affect our use of your Personal Information. You should also check this posted Privacy Policy for any future changes. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy or any revised policy, please exit the site immediately and terminate your membership in Wellness.com.
