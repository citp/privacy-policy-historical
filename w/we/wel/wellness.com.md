The website may collect anonymous, non-Personal Information about your use of the website through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small computer files that are transferred with your permission to your computer's hard drive. This cookie file recognizes “your computer” (not your personal information) as a repeat visitor and allows the website operator to record how often each computer visits the website and the particular pages viewed by the computer. Every computer is assigned a different cookie by Wellness.com. The information collected by cookies can also help the company dynamically generate content on web pages specifically designed for your interests and also allows the company to statistically monitor how many people are using the site and for what purpose.

Sponsors, partners, advertisers, or other third parties on Wellness.com may also use their own cookies when you click on their advertisement or link to their site or service. Some advertisers use companies other than Wellness.com to serve their ads and these companies ("Ad Servers") may also collect non-Personal Information through the use of cookies on the website. Wellness.com does not control these third parties' use of cookies, or how they manage the non-Personal Information they gather through them. However, we do require Ad Servers to agree that they will not collect any Personal Information from user's visit to a third party advertisement without your consent and to agree they will not link any non-personal cookie information collected by their advertisement to Personal Information they or others collect in other ways or from other websites.

**4\. Your Privacy Choices**

Users will occasionally be presented with the option of receiving informational emails or newsletters from Wellness.com. Users may exercise these options by indicating their email preferences for receiving these communications.

**5\. Protecting your Personal Information**

Wellness.com, Inc. takes reasonable technological and physical security measures to protect each user’s Personal Information; however, users must protect their own passwords and log-in information themselves. The Company cannot protect a user’s Personal Information from a third-party who has obtained their log-in and password credentials legally or illegally. User's are cautioned to take great care to protect their own passwords. Some recommended strategies to help protect passwords are as follows: 

  * Always select a password that is a mixture of at least 7 letters and numbers that cannot be easily associated with your known personal information.
  * Never enter your password in the presence of another person who could watch you type it.
  * Never use the same password on different websites that are insecure or possibly run by companies which do not protect your Personal Information.



**6\. Updating Your Personal Information and Contacting Wellness.com**

You can always contact us in order to (1) delete your Personal Information or (2) update the Personal Information that you have provided to us by emailing us at [support@wellness.com](mailto:support@wellness.com). Such changes will not have any effect on other information that Wellness.com maintains. You may not delete your Personal Information if you wish to continue access to the Website and/or our Wellness.com members-only services.

It is not technologically reasonable to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to Wellness.com from our computers servers. The need to back-up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your Personal Information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for the company to locate. Nevertheless, upon receiving your request, all Personal Information stored in the live active databases we host will be removed.

Privacy as it applies to the Internet is a dynamic, rapidly developing area. In the future, the company may make significant changes to its privacy policy affecting the use of the Personal Information it collects. The company will notify users by email of any significant material changes to its privacy policy and obtain your "opt-in" consent to any significant new uses of your Personal Information, if it was collected from you prior to a significant change in this policy. The company may also make non-significant changes to our Privacy Policy that generally will not affect the use of your Personal Information. You should also check this posted Privacy Policy for any future changes. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy or any revised policy, please exit the site immediately and terminate your membership in Wellness.com.
