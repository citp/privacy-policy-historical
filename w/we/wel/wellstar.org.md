1\. Personal Information WellStar Collects. WellStar's web server recognizes the IP address of your domain name, but does not associate your IP address to your personal information. An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer each time you access the Internet. All computer identification and communication on the Internet is conducted using IP addresses. WellStar collects IP addresses in order to facilitate system administration, report aggregate information to licensors, sponsors, advertisers, and suppliers, and to conduct Site analysis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, WellStar may associate your IP address with your e-mail address to identify you if you refuse to comply with WellStar's Web Site User Agreement, and to identify you if you threaten this Site, its users or others. IF YOU SEND WELLSTAR E-MAIL, SUBSCRIBE TO A NEWSLETTER, OR ORDER PRODUCTS FROM THIS SITE, WELLSTAR WILL HAVE YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS AT THIS SITE. WellStar uses "cookies" to personalize the Site for you and to collect aggregate information about site usage by all users. A cookie is a text file that this Site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record keeping purposes. The cookie assigns a random, unique number to your computer. We do NOT use this cookie to collect or store personally identifiable information about you. The Site uses cookies during your interactive on-line session to deliver content specific to your interests and to avoid repeatedly showing you the same advertisement or other message. WellStar's log files only contain data reporting the areas of the Site that you visit along with the cookie information. WellStar's sponsors, licensors, suppliers or advertisers may also use cookies when you select their link from this Site. Any information that WellStar collects and stores using cookies is solely for internal use and will not be sold, rented, leased, exchanged or given to other third parties. WELLSTAR IS UNABLE TO AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY THIRD PARTY'S USE OF COOKIES AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THE INFORMATION THEY GATHER. WellStar does not intend to collect any information from children or minors. In the event WellStar learns that it has inadvertently collected information from a child or minor under the age of eighteen (18), any and all such information will be promptly deleted from WellStar's systems. You may request delivery of services, communications or products to your e-mail address or, in some cases, to a valid U.S. postal address.

2\. How WellStar Uses Your Personal Information. WellStar only uses your personal information to provide you with the services, communications, or products that you have requested or as otherwise described in this Policy. In the event you request a service, communication, or product either from WellStar or a third party at the Site, and such service, communication, or product requires the disclosure of personal information to complete the transaction, WellStar will tell you beforehand and provide you an opportunity to affirmatively opt in, prior to transferring the personal information and proceeding with the delivery of your requested service, communication, or product. With respect to e-commerce or e-healthcare transactions, WellStar may store your personal information to verify the transaction for customer service and accounting reasons and may use this information to personalize your future experiences at this Site. WellStar will not use your personal information to contact you for any other purpose, unless necessary for the enforcement of this Policy or the Web Site User Agreement. In addition, WellStar may also share certain unidentifiable portions of your personal information, in aggregate form, with other third parties. If you purchase an item through WellStar's Health and Fitness Store and/or Gift Shop Bank of America requests information from you on the order form, including but not limited to, your name, shipping address, credit card number and expiration date. This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your order. If Bank of America encounters a problem while filling your order, this contact information will be used to notify you.

3\. Personal Information WellStar Discloses. Except as otherwise provided herein, WellStar will not disclose any personal information it gathers about you that could be used to identify or contact you. Any of your personal information that WellStar does provide to third parties will be treated in accordance with the terms of this Policy and subject to a Chain-of-Trust agreement entered into by and between WellStar and any such third party. In addition, in the following limited circumstances, WellStar may release your personal information to third parties: 1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, subpoena or court order; or 2) in special cases such as a threat of physical violence to you or others. WellStar may also provide your personal information to third parties, such as licensors, sponsors, advertisers, and suppliers at this Site, where it is necessary for them to provide WellStar with products and services related to better operation and maintenance of this Site. By entering into a Chain-of-Trust agreement with such third parties, WellStar attempts to prevent further dissemination and disclosure of your personal information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from time to time, WellStar may provide to third parties information about you which does not allow you to be identified or contacted. If you obtain dial-up access to this Site from an independent Internet service provider ("ISP"), the ISP may have information relating to you, which can be connected with information you provide at this Site. Please check the privacy policy of your ISP, or any other company that provides content, service or products to you, as to how it uses your information.

5\. WellStar's Security Practices and Procedures. WellStar wants your personal information to remain as secure as reasonably possible. Hence, we have taken several measures to protect your information from loss, misuse or alteration, by using a combination of administrative procedures, physical, and technical safeguards. With respect to technical safeguards, WellStar uses a Secure Socket Layer protocol connection ("SSL"), to help ensure the integrity and privacy of the personal information you provide to WellStar via the Internet. All transactions involving sensitive information such as your credit/debit card number are conducted using a SSL connection. This connection provides increased security of your information as it is transmitted to our website. WellStar stores your personal information on a separate server where your user password is encrypted and stored in a database. This server and database are located in a physically secured area. In addition, access to personal information is controlled by authentication. On the administrative side, only authorized WellStar employees are permitted access to your personal information, strictly on a "need to know basis." In addition, all WellStar employees must abide by and sign a copy of WellStar's privacy and confidentiality policies. When WellStar deals with third parties, WellStar and the third party must enter into a Chain-of-Trust agreement and only authorized employees of the third party are permitted access to your personal information on a "need to know basis." Any WellStar or third party employee who violates such policies is subject to disciplinary action, which may result in termination.
