  5. **Your choices for information sharing and marketing.** We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, within the affiliated Wells Fargo and Wachovia companies, which include administrative and service units, consumer bankers, mortgage lenders, consumer lenders, securities broker-dealers, insurance agencies, and real estate brokerage companies. These companies include Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., (including its divisions of Wachovia Bank and Wachovia Bank of Delaware), Wells Fargo Insurance, Inc., Wells Fargo Investments, L.L.C., Wells Fargo Insurance Services, Inc.,., Wachovia Administrative Services, Inc., Wells Fargo Advantage Funds, Wachovia Management Corp., Wachovia Warranty Corp., Heritage Indemnity Company, Heritage Mechanical Breakdown Corp., J.L.

First Clearing does not market to holders of accounts carried by First Clearing or provide information regarding such accounts to other Wells Fargo or Wachovia companies for their own marketing purposes, and the choices below do not apply to First Clearing. 

By law, information that is derived from your transactions and experiences with us may be shared among the Wells Fargo and Wachovia companies (a) for purposes other than direct marketing, and (b) unless you instruct us otherwise, for direct marketing purposes.

If you choose to limit information sharing, we will not share personal financial information about you among affiliates (other than information derived from your transactions and experiences with Wells Fargo and Wachovia companies) for any purpose, except as permitted by law. In addition, if you select that option, we will limit affiliates' use of transaction, experience and other personal financial information about you for direct marketing purposes. However, your choice regarding the use of certain information for marketing purposes does not apply to any Wells Fargo or Wachovia company that has an existing business relationship with you or where the use is otherwise permitted by law. To opt out of information sharing and marketing, use one of the methods described below. Your election will apply until you tell us to change your choice.

**Telephone and mail preferences.**

In addition to information sharing preferences, you may request that we not contact you for marketing purposes by telephone. For consumer accounts, this election will be effective while you are an active client or a minimum of five years. For business accounts, this election will be effective for five years from the date the election is received. You may also request that we not contact you for marketing purposes by mail. For all accounts, this election will be effective for three years.

**Communicate your information sharing, telephone and mail preferences in any of the following ways:**

Call Wells Fargo Advisors at 1-877-358-1114.  
Visit a Wells Fargo or Wells Fargo Advisors office.

Your preferences will apply to you only - unless you tell us that they also apply to other individuals listed on your accounts.

**Do Not Call Policy:** This Privacy Policy constitutes Wells Fargo and Wachovia's Do Not Call Policy under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act for all consumers. Wells Fargo and Wachovia maintain an internal Do Not Call preference list. Do Not Call requests will be honored within 30 days and will be effective for at least five years from the date of request.

Please note that if you choose to receive solicitations by mail or any other channel you may continue to receive marketing information about Wells Fargo and Wachovia products or services in regular account mailings and statements, when you visit us online or at an ATM. You may also be contacted to service your account or conduct surveys. If you have an assigned financial advisor or team, they may continue to contact you to assist you in managing your portfolio or relationship.

**When Financial Advisors Leave Wells Fargo Advisors**   
Wells Fargo Advisors recognizes that your relationship with your financial advisor is important. If your financial advisor's affiliation with Wells Fargo Advisors ends and he or she joins a non-affiliated securities broker-dealer with which Wells Fargo Advisors has entered into an agreement regarding the movement of financial advisors between firms, Wells Fargo Advisors will permit the financial advisor to use certain client contact information to solicit clients to join the financial advisor's new firm. The client contact information that the financial advisor may use is limited to your name, address, email address, phone number and account title. 

If your financial advisor is affiliated with Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC (WFAFN) and the financial advisor's relationship with WFAFN is terminated, your WFAFN financial advisor will also be permitted to retain originals or copies of all client and account documentation for the purpose of continuing the relationship with you and servicing your account through the financial advisor's new firm. Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC will also retain your client and account documentation.

## Tips To Help You Protect Your Personal Information

  * Carry only necessary information with you. Leave your Social Security card and unused credit cards at home in a safe location.
  * Make photocopies of vital information you carry regularly and store them in a secure place, such as a safe deposit box.
  * Do not provide your Social Security Number unless absolutely necessary.
  * Shred documents containing personal or financial information before discarding. Fraud and identity theft often occurs as a result of mail and garbage theft.
  * Place outgoing mail in a U.S. Postal Service mailbox to reduce the chance of mail theft.
  * Promptly retrieve incoming mail to reduce the opportunity for theft.
  * Monitor your credit report for accuracy. By law, you are entitled to receive one free credit file disclosure every 12 months from each of the nationwide consumer credit reporting companies.
