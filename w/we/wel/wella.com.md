Your information (personal and non-personal) may be shared within the Coty group of companies (Coty Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries). However, Coty does not disclose or sell your personal data to third parties, except to specific third parties as described below:

  **Third Parties for Marketing Purposes**  
Certain promotions and events sponsored by Coty or certain portions of the Coty Sites may offer you the opportunity to consent to the sharing of your information with Coty’s business partners such as Coty’s licensors or promotion co-sponsors. If you have given your explicit consent, your information will be shared with that specific third party and the information you provide may be used by such third party for their own purposes and in accordance with their own policies (including how to opt-out with such third party).

  **Service Providers**  
Coty engages third party service providers to perform functions on Coty’s behalf. Examples include data analyses firms, customer support specialists, fulfillment companies (e.g., companies that coordinate email campaigns, sweepstakes, contests or promotions) and web-hosting companies. Such third parties may be provided with access to your information (personal and non personal) as needed to perform their functions. However, they are not authorized by Coty to use such information for any other purpose or transfer it to anyone else.

  **Aggregated Information**  
Coty may share certain information you provide in an aggregated and anonymous form with third parties we have engaged for internal business and planning purposes, such as statistics or developing marketing plans. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your personal information.

  **Business Transfers**  
Coty may transfer, divest, assign, share, sell or otherwise engage in a transaction that involves some or all of our assets, including any or all of your information, in the course of a corporate divestiture, merger, acquisition, joint venture, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or any other similar transaction or proceeding.

  **Compliance with Laws**  
Coty may disclose any information, including personal information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request. We may also disclose personal information where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, as part of the administration of our risk reduction program, or as otherwise permitted by law.
