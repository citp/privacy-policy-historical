# Wellness Mama Privacy Policy

I believe that your privacy is very important.

This privacy policy applies to all personal information given and received. I define personal information as anything that would personally identify you: your name, your phone & email contact information, your physical and/or mailing address, your preferences, and other information that is not generally available to the public. Of course, this policy applies to [Wellness Mama](http://wellnessmama.com/) and no other companies or entities.

Wellness Mama gathers personal information about you (name and email address) when you sign up for my newsletter. Also, your browser gives me your IP address and cookie information.

## What I do with this information

I do this to personalize your experience – nothing more, nothing less. This information allows me to talk to you, improve service to you, and provide strictly anonymous reporting to other clients.

Children under 13 must have a parent or guardian approve registry with the  _Wellness Mama_ newsletter or forum. I will not contact children under 13 for personal information, sales promotions, or marketing purposes.

I don’t rent, sell, give or share any of your personal information unless it’s to provide a service or product you request, or is regulated by confidential requirements. I value my relationship with you and your privacy. Your information is never made available without your explicit consent.

You are always free to terminate your relationship with Wellness Mama and request that your information be removed from our system.

I provide complete physical, electronic and procedural security steps that comply with all federal government regulations in order to protect your information.

From time to time, this policy may be modified. I will always inform you of any changes by contacting you via the email address you have provided me.

If you have any questions, please feel free to [contact me](http://wellnessmama.com/contact/).

Views expressed on this website are just that – views. Opinions and information presented on this site are not intended to replace the advice of your primary health care provider. Please enjoy responsibly!

Pictures, images, graphics, and whatnot: All graphics and images are property of [Wellness Mama](http://wellnessmama.com/) unless otherwise noted. I always try to give credit where credit is due. If you find a picture on the site and you’d rather it not be here, just let me know and I’ll remove it!
