                    <p>By law, information that is derived from your transactions and experiences with us may be shared among the Wells Fargo and Wachovia companies (a) for purposes other than direct marketing, and (b) unless you instruct us otherwise, for direct marketing purposes.</p>


                    <p>If you choose to limit information sharing, we will not share personal financial information about you among affiliates (other than information derived from your transactions and experiences with Wells Fargo and Wachovia companies) for any purpose, except as permitted by law. In addition, if you select that option, we will limit affiliates' use of transaction, experience and other personal financial information about you for direct marketing purposes. However, your choice regarding the use of certain information for marketing purposes does not apply to any Wells Fargo or Wachovia company that has an existing business relationship with you or where the use is otherwise permitted by law. To opt out of information sharing and marketing, use one of the methods described below. Your election will apply until you tell us to change your choice.</p>


                    <strong>Telephone and mail preferences.</strong>
                    <br>

                    <p class="nearhead">In addition to information sharing preferences, you may request that we not contact you for marketing purposes by telephone.

                    <br>

                    <div style=" margin-left: 20px;">Call Wells Fargo Advisors at 1-877-358-1114.<br>
Visit a Wells Fargo or Wells Fargo Advisors office.</div>

                </div>

                    <strong>When Financial Advisors Leave Wells Fargo Advisors</strong>
                    <br>
Wells Fargo Advisors recognizes that your relationship with your financial advisor is important. If your financial advisor's affiliation with Wells Fargo Advisors ends and he or she joins a non-affiliated securities broker-dealer with which Wells Fargo Advisors has entered into an agreement regarding the movement of financial advisors between firms, Wells Fargo Advisors will permit the financial advisor to use certain client contact information to solicit clients to join the financial advisor's new firm. The client contact information that the financial advisor may use is limited to your name, address, email address, phone number and account title. 

<p>If your financial advisor is affiliated with Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC (WFAFN) and the financial advisor's relationship with WFAFN is terminated, your WFAFN financial advisor will also be permitted to retain originals or copies of all client and account documentation for the purpose of continuing the relationship with you and servicing your account through the financial advisor's new firm. Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC will also retain your client and account documentation.</p>
