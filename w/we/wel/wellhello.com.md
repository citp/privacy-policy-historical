 **Our Commitment to Privacy**

Wellhello.com (the “Site”) takes your privacy seriously, and we want to provide a safe and secure user experience for you. This Policy is designed to help you understand how and why we treat your personal information, and what you can do about it. Please read this Policy carefully, as —along with our Terms— it constitutes a binding Agreement.

 **What Personal Data Do We Collect?**

WellHello collects certain types of personal data when you register on the site, such as name, location, email address, and any other personal information that you may provide. Additionally, WellHello automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, such as IP addresses and cookies (you can learn more about these below).

 **What Do We Do With Your Personal Data?**

We collect data to operate effectively and provide a quality experience for you. We use information about you to provide the services to you, including to process transactions, authenticate you when you log in, customize your experience, provide customer support, and operate and maintain the Site. If you don’t agree to our collection of this information, you may be limited or restricted in the services available to you.

 **What Are Cookies?**

A “cookie” is a small piece of data that a Web site stores in a designated file on your computer. Cookies are commonly used to store user names and/or passwords to facilitate access to the site. Cookies can also be used to store user preferences, login dates and times, and content viewing history. When you visit a website, that site can access that information which it stored in a cookie. Cookies make your online experience easier and more personalized. We use cookies and other technologies to recognize you and personalize your experience, as well as to help us understand how our site is used. Users must have cookies enabled in order for the site to function properly. Cookies themselves do not tell WellHello any personal information about the user. If you do not accept our use of cookies, you may be limited or restricted in your use of the Site.

 **What Is Server Log and Clickstream Data?**

Our site’s servers automatically identify your computer by its Internet Protocol (IP) address (a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider) each time you access the site, and maintain logs of the specific content on the site that you access. Our servers also record various information pertaining to your computer configuration, including the Web browser software you use, the resolution settings of your monitor, and the website from which you were referred to us, if any. We use this information anonymously to help us determine what is the most beneficial for our users and how we can create a better overall user experience.

We only share users’ personal data with third parties under the certain circumstances, which are:

  * With vendors, consultants, and other service providers who need access to this information to perform their services. These third parties may have access to your information as necessary to perform their functions, and they are contractually obliged to maintain the confidentiality of any personal data they may come in contact with as part of their services to WellHello.

  * We may share aggregated or anonymized information which cannot be reasonably used to identify you in order to gather data to enhance and design our Site.
  * We may share personal data between and among WellHello and its current and future parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or other companies under common control and ownership.

The conservation period for your data lasts as long as you maintain your membership or affiliation to WellHello, and as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
