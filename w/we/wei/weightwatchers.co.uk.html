We may collect information (including information that is Personally Identifiable Information) from you in different manners and at different places and times on our Website, such as when you become a community user on our Website or subscribe to one of our Internet Products.  We also may collect information from you in connection with, or through, other Internet Products we may make available on our Website from time to time.  The following is a description of the areas and/or manners in which we primarily collect information about you.

<br><br><b><i><span class="darker">Becoming a Community User and Subscriber.</span></i></b><br>
In order to access certain Internet Products on our Website, such as our message boards, weight loss tools and food database, you must first complete certain steps to become either a community user or a subscriber.  During these steps, you may be required to provide us with information (including Personally Identifiable Information) such as name, postcode and email address, and, if you subscribe to one of our Internet Products, credit card and billing information.  This information is used to help us understand who uses our Website, to improve our Website and our Internet Products, to contact users about requested Internet Products and/or for subscription billing purposes.  It is optional for you to provide demographic information (such as profession and number of children), but providing this information is encouraged so we can provide a more personalised experience on our Website.<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td height="15"></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><b class="subhead"><b><i><span class="darker">Cookies and Action Tags.</span></i></b></b><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">We also collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information passively using "cookies" and "action tags."<br><br>
"Cookies" are small text files that are placed on your computer in order to identify (i) your Web browser, (ii) the activities of your computer on our Website and (iii) your activity in connection with our advertisements and other marketing and promotional efforts. Cookies are used to <br><ul><li>personalise your experience on our Website (such as dynamically generating content on webpages specifically designed for you),</li><li>assist you in using our Internet Products (such as saving time by not having to reenter your name upon each visit to our Website),</li><li>allow us to statistically monitor how you are using our Website to help us improve our online offerings.</li></ul>	
We also may use cookies to conduct marketing and promotional efforts, tailor certain advertisements to your browser that we think may be of interest to you, or to determine the popularity of certain content.<br><br>
In addition to cookies that we place on your computer, cookies may also be placed on your computer by third parties that we use to display or serve advertisements or to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information in order to provide advertising-related services. For example, DoubleClick Inc. ("DoubleClick") and Avenue A, LLC, which employs Atlas DMT ("Atlas") technology, place cookies in the course of serving advertisements for us. Neither DoubleClick, Atlas nor their cookies collect Personally Identifiable Information on our Website, and we do not share Personally Identifiable Information with them without your permission. <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/">DoubleClick's privacy policy</a> describes its data collection practices and explains the way in which you can "opt-out" of certain tracking by DoubleClick. <a href="http://www.atlasdmt.com/privacy/">Atlas's privacy policy</a> describes its data collection practices and explains the way in which you can "opt-out" of certain tracking by Atlas.<br><br>
You do not have to accept cookies to use our Website.  Although most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, you may reset your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to reject cookies generally.  Most browsers offer instructions on how to do so in the "Help" section of the toolbar.  While you are not required to accept our cookies to access our Website, if you reject cookies, certain products, offerings, features, or resources of our Website (including certain Internet Products) may not work properly and you may experience some loss of convenience.<br><br>
"Action tags," also known as web beacons or gif tags, are a web technology used to help track website usage information, such as how many times a specific page has been viewed. Action tags are invisible to you, and any portion of our Website, including advertisements, or e-mail sent on our behalf, may contain cookies that are associated with action tags that our located on our Website. Unlike cookies, action tags are not placed on your computer.<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td height="15"></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">We may select and use different third parties from time to time to track website usage through action tags on our Website and on our advertisements on other websites. For example, DoubleClick and Atlas each track anonymous website usage by setting a cookie (or reading a cookie previously placed by them) on users' computers to track the activities of users who view a web page that contains action tags. DoubleClick and Atlas may use information about your visits to this Website and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by one of these companies, please refer to its respective Privacy Policy. Many Internet users already have a DoubleClick and/or Atlas cookie on their computer today, and tracking through the use of action tags is considered common practice in the industry. Periodically, upon our request, DoubleClick and/or Atlas may report the anonymous data that they collect on our behalf back to us for our internal use and analysis and our treatment of this anonymous data is governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
By using cookies and action tags together, we are able to gain valuable information to improve our Website and our Internet Products and measure the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns. We do not disclose any of your Personally Identifiable Information to our advertising partners through the use of cookies or action tags.<br><br>
Finally, please note that advertisers and other third parties may also use their own cookies or action tags when you click on their advertisement or link to their website or service, on or from our Website.  This Privacy Policy does not govern the use by such third-party websites or providers of third-party advertising.<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td height="15"></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><b class="subhead"><b><i><span class="darker">Referral Programmes.</span></i></b></b><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Through third party referral programme operators and others, we offer referral programmes whereby referral websites can earn commissions through the referral of subscribers or other purchasers to our Website.

If you choose to apply to a referral website, we use the data you provide strictly for conducting business with you.

These Outside Contractors may sometimes have limited access to information collected on our Website, including your Personally Identifiable Information, in the course of providing products or services to us. Access to your Personally Identifiable Information by these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for the Outside Contractors to perform their limited function for us.

In addition, through our Website, you may be given the opportunity to purchase (or to obtain more information regarding) certain content, products or services which are sold through a person or company other than us or our Affiliates (collectively, "Third Party Sellers").  We will attempt to make it clear to you when you are dealing with a Third Party Seller by opening a new browser or otherwise notifying you that you are leaving our Website.  For example, if you see a phrase such as "powered by" or "brought to you by" followed by the name of a person or company other than WeightWatchers.co.uk, then you are likely on, or about to enter, a website hosted or operated by a person or company other than us.  Third Party Sellers may request that you submit certain information to them in order to purchase their products or services or to obtain additional information from them.  You do not need to submit this information or purchase any products or services from Third Party Sellers to access our Website.  By submitting the requested information, you affirmatively consent to have that information shared with the Third Party Seller.  This information is used by the Third Party Seller and may be subject to a different privacy policy.

Our Website contains links to other websites not owned or operated by WeightWatchers.co.uk (for example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, you will likely be taken off our Website), including links to websites operated by franchisees of Weight Watchers International, Inc. We will attempt to make it obvious to you when you leave our Website and enter these websites by opening a new browser or otherwise notifying you that you are leaving our Website.  However, please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such websites.

We want your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) to remain as secure as possible.  We strive to provide secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers through industry-standard techniques.  To help ensure the integrity and privacy of the Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us via the Internet at the time you elect to become a community user or subscribe to our Internet Products, we use Secured Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology in transmitting such Personally Identifiable Information over the Internet to our servers.  We secure the Personally Identifiable Information you provide on servers located in controlled, secure environments, protected from unauthorised access, use, or alteration.  Only employees who need access to your information to perform a specific task or function are granted access to such information.  In addition, all WeightWatchers.co.uk employees must abide by this Privacy Policy and are kept up-to-date on security practices.  Any employee who violates this Privacy Policy is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.<br><br>
Notwithstanding the above commitments to protect your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) from loss, misuse or alteration by third parties, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet.  There is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems.  As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.<br><a href="" name="9"></a><br><b>WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE REGARDING THE COLLECTION, DISCLOSURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?</b><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td height="15"></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will only use Personally Identifiable Information for the purposes described above or as otherwise disclosed at the time we request such information from you.
