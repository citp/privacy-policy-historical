                    From time to time opportunities arise that we believe will benefit our customers
                    and former customers. On a selective basis, we may share your name, address, telephone

                    companies and tax service providers, record storage companies, moving companies,
                    and other businesses that provide services to home owners, to market financial and
                    non-financial products and services that may interest you. We will only provide
                    this information to companies making these offers available to you under strict
                    confidentiality agreements. For instance, we may share certain information with
                    our strategic business partners with whom we have agreements to help provide customers
                    with Weichert One Stop Shopping Services, or with other companies which help us
                    to conduct business, such as credit bureaus and businesses which provide account
                    maintenance, analysis and servicing. We may also provide information to regulatory
                    authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable law. If
                    you do not want to participate in these opportunities, please refer to the Opt-Out
