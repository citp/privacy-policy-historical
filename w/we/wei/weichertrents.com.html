                    Weichert, Realtors Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>Weichert, Realtors and the affiliated companies of Weichert (“Weichert”
                        or “we”)</strong> recognize the importance of protecting the privacy
                    of certain information collected about our customers and potential customers. This
                    Privacy Policy was created in order to demonstrate our commitment to protecting
                    our customers' privacy.</p>
                <p>
                    Weichert may gather information from a variety of ways, including, loan applications
                    submitted by potential borrowers, forms requesting additional information about
                    a property, product or a service provided by Weichert. Weichert also learns of statistical
                    patterns that show preferences for certain properties, market areas and services.
                    This type of information is used to offer better services to the users of the Weichert
                    web site. For instance, we may use statistical information to develop better tools
                    to assist home sellers in marketing their homes to specific buyers interested in
                    properties that meet their requirements.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Personally Identifiable Information Collected.</strong> Depending on the
                    products and services you are interested in we may collect personally identifiable
                    information such as (i) your name, address, telephone number, email address, social
                    security number, assets, employment and income; (ii) data based on your experiences
                    with us, with other Weichert affiliates, and with other service providers, such
                    as your payment history, transaction parties, insurance policy coverage and premium
                    amount, and (iii) information from consumer reporting agencies, such as your creditworthiness
                    and credit history. We maintain strict physical, electronic and procedural safeguards
                    that comply with federal regulations to protect all personal nonpublic information.
                    We restrict access to this information to only those persons who need to know it
                    in order to provide you with products or services. We do not seek to collect personal
                    information from children under the age of 18. We believe that children under the
                    age of 18 should obtain permission from their parents before providing any personal
                    information to us via this website.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sharing Information.</strong> Weichert may share certain information regarding
                    our customers and former customers among Weichert affiliates only in accordance
                    with our strict security standards and confidentiality policies, and applicable
                    laws. We hold our employees and agents fully accountable for adhering to these standards,
                    policies and laws.</p>
                <p>
                    From time to time opportunities arise that we believe will benefit our customers
                    and former customers. On a selective basis, we may share your name, address, telephone
                    number and email address with third parties, such as insurance agencies, home warranty
                    companies and tax service providers, record storage companies, moving companies,
                    and other businesses that provide services to home owners, to market financial and
                    non-financial products and services that may interest you. We will only provide
                    this information to companies making these offers available to you under strict
                    confidentiality agreements. For instance, we may share certain information with
                    our strategic business partners with whom we have agreements to help provide customers
                    with Weichert One Stop Shopping Services, or with other companies which help us
                    to conduct business, such as credit bureaus and businesses which provide account
                    maintenance, analysis and servicing. We may also provide information to regulatory
                    authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable law. If
                    you do not want to participate in these opportunities, please refer to the Opt-Out
                    Notice Section below to learn about how to opt out.</p>
