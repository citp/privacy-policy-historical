**SOCIAL PLUG-INS AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY FEATURES**

Our Website contains links to or features from other websites. This Privacy Policy covers the privacy practices of Weight Watchers only and does not cover the privacy practices of third-party websites or features. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of third parties. When linking to another website or using a third-party service, you should read the privacy policy on that site or service. 

To the extent certain third-party website features are available on our Website, the following terms apply: 

We use plug-ins of the social networks Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube to enable our Website users to easily share content found on our Website and connect with their friends via such social networks. Whenever you view a page of our Website containing such plug-in, your browser establishes a direct connection to the servers operated by provider of the social network. As a result, the content of the social plug-in is transferred by the network provider directly to your browser and embedded in our Website being shown. If you visit our Website whilst signed into your social network user account, information concerning your visit will be transferred to the network provider and the provider of the social network can assign your visit to our Website to your account with the social network. Please note that a data transfer is triggered already when you visit our Website, irrespective whether you interact with the plug-in. To prevent this you must log out of your social network account before visiting our Website. Please refer to the privacy policies of Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube for more information on the purpose and scope of data collection and data analysis undertaken by the social network as well as your options to modify settings and how to protect your privacy. 

Our Website offers you the option to connect your Weight Watchers account with third party applications or devices (each a "Tracker") such as activity trackers that measure your activity level (e.g. the number of steps and distance walked, calories burned and other personal met-rics). If you connect your Weight Watchers account with an account you have with a provider of a Tracker, the third party provider will receive the information from us that you have a Weight Watchers account. At the same time, data collected by your third party Tracker (for example, personal activity data collected via an activity tracker device or other collected data) will be transferred to us and may be incorporated into your Weight Watchers account (for example, to display activity SmartPoints® values earned) in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Poli-cy. You have the option to disconnect the Trackers from your Weight Watchers account at any time via our website. Please refer to the privacy policy of your Tracker provider for further de-tails, which may include information on what specific data is collected by your third party Tracker and account. 

**Apple HealthKit**

We provide our subscribers the ability to sync with Apple’s HealthKit framework, which provides the ability to access your health and fitness data to help you keep track of your activity in the WW app on your iPhone and Apple Watch if you so choose. (For more information [click here](https://foundations.weightwatchers.co.uk/help/article/590d0fbe15b8be005a4b08fa-en_UK/how-do-i-connect-and-sync-my-fitness-device)). We do not use information gained through the HealthKit framework for advertising or similar services. You can always stop WW from accessing your data by changing the settings of your mobile device. 

**HOW WE SHARE AND DISCLOSE PERSONAL DATA**

We will not share, sell, transfer or otherwise disseminate your Personal Data to third parties, unless required by law according to Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR, unless required for the purpose of your contract according to Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, unless the third party acts as a data processor on our behalf according to Art. 28 GDPR or you have given us express consent to do so according to Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR. 

We share some of your Personal Data with another Weight Watchers company located in the United States to provide hosting services to us. 

We also use third-party service providers to offer or facilitate services on our behalf and share your Personal Data with such providers to the extent necessary for such providers to perform their services on our behalf. In particular, we use a mailing company to dispatch email market-ing messages, payment service providers to bill you for goods and services and for credit card processing, specialist providers for payment collection and fraud screening, a shipping company to fulfil orders, a call centre provider to facilitate customer service, social media and other agencies to manage our social media and other advertising campaigns, a cloud provider for our CRM system and an external provider for the hosting of our web shop. 

Some of the companies we share your Personal Data with as described above are located outside of the European Economic Area. 

In order to grant sufficient protection of your Personal Data in this context, we use standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission according to Art. 46(2)(c) GDPR with such companies or certifications of such companies under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield according to Art. 45(1) GDPR. You can request further details by contacting us at the contact details as mentioned below.

We have carefully selected these companies and continuously monitor their compli-ance with our instructions. These companies are contractually prohibited from using your Per-sonal Data for any other purposes than those described in this Privacy Policy. The legal basis for our sharing of your Personal Data with such companies is Art. 28(1) GDPR or alternatively our legitimate interests in commissioning those companies with the services described above (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). 

We may also be required to disclose your Personal Data to government or law enforcement officials in response to a lawful request by a public authority or if we have to do so to comply with a legal obligation, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements according to Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. We can also disclose your information in order to pursue our legitimate interest in applying or enforcing our terms and conditions or in responding to any claims, in protecting our rights or the rights of a third party, in protecting the safety of any person or in preventing any illegal activity (including for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction) according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. 

If required under applicable data protection laws, we will collect your prior consent before shar-ing your Personal Data with other companies. In such cases, the legal basis is Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR.
