		We may select and use different third parties from time to time to track website usage through action tags on our Website and on our advertisements on other websites.  For example, DoubleClick and Atlas each track anonymous website usage through action tags on our Website and other websites. DoubleClick and Atlas do this by setting a cookie (or reading a cookie previously placed by them) on users' computers to track the activities of users who view a web page that contains action tags. DoubleClick and Atlas may use information about your visits to this Website and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by one of these companies, please refer to its respective Privacy Policy. Many Internet users already have a DoubleClick and/or Atlas cookie on their computer today, and tracking through the use of action tags is considered common practice in the industry. Periodically, upon our request, DoubleClick and/or Atlas may report the anonymous data that they collect on our behalf back to us for our internal use and analysis and our treatment of this anonymous data is governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy.

We may share your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) with franchisees of Weight Watchers International, Inc., but only where we indicate to you at time of information collection that such information will be provided to a franchisee, or if we otherwise obtain your permission. <br><br><b><i>Laws and Legal Rights.<br></i></b>
We may also disclose your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with an applicable statute, regulation, rule or law, a subpoena, a search warrant, a court or regulatory order, or other valid legal process. We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information in special circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms &amp; Conditions or our Subscription Agreement, or to protect the safety and/or security of our users, our Website or the general public.<br><br><b><i>Third Parties Generally.<br></i></b>
We may provide to third parties information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of our Website. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit our Website, the demographic breakdown of the registered users of our Website, or the activities that visitors to our Website engage in while on our Website. The third parties to which we may provide this information may include potential or actual advertisers, providers of advertising services (including website tracking services), commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other similar parties.<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td height="15"></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><span class="texttitle"><b><i><span class="darker">Outside Contractors.</span></i></b><br clear="all"></span><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, "Outside Contractors") to provide specific services and products related to our Website or Online Products, such as hosting and maintaining our chat rooms, providing credit card processing and fraud screening, and developing applications for our Website and e-mail services. These Outside Contractors may sometimes have limited access to information collected on our Website, including your Personally Identifiable Information, in the course of providing products or services to us. Access to your Personally Identifiable Information by these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for the Outside Contractors to perform their limited function for us. We also require that these contractors (i) protect the privacy of your Personally Identifiable Information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (ii) not use or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose other than providing us with products or services for which we contracted.<br><br><b><i>Third-Party Sellers.<br></i></b>
In addition, through our Website, you may be given the opportunity to purchase (or to obtain more information) regarding certain content, products or services which are sold through a person or company other than us or our Affiliates (collectively, "Third-Party Sellers"). Similarly, if you purchase a product or service through one of our co-branded stores, you will likely be purchasing the product through a Third-Party Seller and not from us. We will attempt to make it clear to you when you are dealing with a Third-Party Seller by opening a new browser or otherwise notifying you that you are leaving our Website. For example, if you see a phrase such as "powered by" or "brought to you by" followed by the name of a person or company other than WeightWatchers.ca Limited, then you are likely on, or about to enter, a website hosted or operated by a person or company other than us. Third-Party Sellers may request that you submit certain information to them in order to purchase their products or services or to obtain additional information from them. You do not need to submit this information or purchase any products or services from Third-Party Sellers to access our Website. By submitting the requested information, you affirmatively consent to provide that information to the Third-Party Seller. This information is used by the Third-Party Seller and may be subject to a different privacy policy. We do not otherwise share or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to Third-Party Sellers.<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="0"><tbody><tr><td height="15"></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><span class="texttitle"><b><i><span class="darker">Sale of Business.</span></i></b><br clear="all"></span><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">We reserve the right to disclose and/or transfer information (including your Personally Identifiable Information) to a third party in the event of a proposed or actual sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of WeightWatchers.ca, WeightWatchers.com, Inc. or Weight Watchers International, Inc. provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy. <br><a href="" name="6"></a><br><b>DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY WHEN I LINK TO OTHER WEBSITES?<br></b>
Our Website contains links to other websites not owned or operated by WeightWatchers.ca Limited or an Affiliate (for example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, you will likely be taken off our Website), including links to websites operated by franchisees of Weight Watchers International, Inc.

We want your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) to remain as secure as possible. We strive to provide secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers through industry-standard techniques. To help ensure the integrity and privacy of the Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us via the Internet at the time you elect to become a registered user or subscribe to our Online Products, we use Secured Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology in transmitting such Personally Identifiable Information over the Internet to our servers. We secure the Personally Identifiable Information you provide on servers located in controlled, secure environments, protected from unauthorized access, use, or alteration. Only employees or agents who need access to your information to perform a specific task or function are granted access to such information. In addition, all WeightWatchers.ca employees and agents must abide by this Privacy Policy and are kept up-to-date on security practices.
