### PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT

This is the web site of Weight Watchers

Our postal address is:

> 175 Crossways Park West  
>  Woodbury, NY 11797  
>  Attention: Consumer Affairs Dept. IN

or you can reach us via fax at: 1-516-390-1632  
or you can reach us by telephone at: 1-516-390-1657

Weight Watchers historically has respected our members' rights to privacy. We continue to support this policy in the online arena and feel it is our obligation to clearly state our privacy policy to all site visitors.

For each visitor to our website, our web server automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name, but not the email address. We use this information to better understand visitors' use of our site. We collect domain names so that we can aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit. The information we collect is used for internal review to improve the content of our Web site.

Email addresses and other personally identifying data about visitors are known to Weight Watchers only when voluntarily submitted to us.

**MAILING LIST**  
We welcome visitors to become a part of our mailing list and provide access to do so throughout the site. From time to time, we may use this information to contact visitors about products, services, events or news that we believe will be of interest.

We do not share this information with other organizations and will not disseminate it to parties outside of our organization.

Once on the list, we may notify consumers from time to time about updates to our website and contact consumers for marketing purposes. For example, we may email visitors, who provide us with their email addresses, for specific purposes such as receiving email newsletters, updates of site events or being notified if they have won one of our contests.

In response to completing our mailing list form, Weight Watchers International will maintain the name, postal address and email address as provided to us.

If a visitor does not want to continue receiving mail from us in the future, they can let us know by returning to the **Contact Us** or **Guestbook** page form and select **NO** to the question: _Do you want to be added to our mailing list?_ Complete the form and hit **_Submit_**. We will then remove the name from our mailing list.

If a visitor supplies us with a postal address online, they may receive periodic mailings with information on new services, products, and upcoming events. To be removed from the mailing list, a visitor may fill out the online form (responding **NO** to the question: _Do you want to be on our mailing list?_ ) or by writing or faxing to the addresses on the top of this Privacy Policy page.

**FORUM PRIVACY**  
Weight Watchers does not collect or maintain any of the names and/or addresses that individuals attach to postings in our Forum, unless otherwise specified. However, because our Forum is truly an open public dialogue for the entire internet population, once name and/or address is posted to the Forum other individuals and/or organizations may have access to that information just as they would if a name and address was left in any other public venue.

Thank you for visiting www.weightwatchers.com. We appreciate your involvement and hope you enjoy it and find it beneficial.
