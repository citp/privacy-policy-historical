## How we use collected information

Weekdone may collect and use Users personal information for the following purposes:

  * To improve customer service. Information you provide helps us respond to your customer service requests and support needs more efficiently.
  * To personalize user experience. Your data helps us to customize how the user interface and features look like for you, or provide you with tips, hints and training.
  * To improve our Service. We may use feedback you provide to improve our products and services. We may use information in the aggregate to understand how our Users as a group use the services and resources provided on our Service. We use it to diagnose and fix problems you might have while using the Service.
  * To process payments. We may use the information Users provide about themselves when placing an order only to provide service to that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to provide the service.
  * For accounting and legal compliance. We use your data to invoice you, keep you in our accounting system or in the legal archives as needed by the law.
  * To honor our contractual commitments to you: Much of our processing of personal data is to meet our contractual obligations to our users, or to take steps at users’ request in anticipation of entering into a contract with them. For example, we handle personal data on this basis to create your account and provide our Services.
  * To inform you of new features, promotions, contests, surveys or other Service improvement or training activities. We send Users information you agreed to receive about topics we think will be of interest to you.
  * To send periodic emails. We may use the email address to send User information and updates pertaining to their usage. It may also be used to respond to their inquiries, questions, and/or other requests. We may use the email address to send User emails that may include company news, updates, related product or service information, etc. If at any time the User would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.

The data is used to improve the service for you

## How we protect your information

  * We adopt appropriate data protection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, passwords, transaction information, any content and data stored on our Service.
  * We are compliant with the "EU Data Protection Law" which means (i) prior to 25th May 2018, European Union Directive 95/46/EC; and (ii) on and after 25th May 2018, European Union Regulation 2016/679 ("GDPR"). 
  * We do everything possible to protect your data. This includes but is not limited to HTTPS/SSL, SSH and other encryption protocols for data access. Sensitive and private data exchange between the Service and its Users happens mostly over a HTTPS/SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital encryption keys. Our servers are protected by firewalls and access fiters. Our Service is also in compliance with PCI vulnerability standards in order to create as secure of an environment as possible for Users.
  * We use system monitoring tools and logging to keep an eye on system usage and discover any security improvement points.
  * Our servers are located at a high grade security data center based in Tallinn, Estonia, in the European Union. 
  * Access to our servers is limited to a limited number of our security-minded and trained employees.
  * Our team has over 20 years of experience in developing and running secure enterprise solutions and doing data security consulting. Our team has even founded a specialized data security firm that has served banks, large enterprises, and government institutions.
  * Each customer can only access data pertaining to their company account.
  * When payments are processed via credit card, we use third party vendors that are PCI DSS compliant.
  * However, no security or encryption method can be guaranteed to protect information from hackers or human error, so the Service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Still we do our best to make sure your data is and remains 100% confidential.



## In short

We do everything possible to protect your data
