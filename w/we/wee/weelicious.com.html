Cookies may also be used by third-party services, such as Google Analytics, as described herein.</p>

</p>
<p>Retargeting&nbsp;Ads</p>
<p>From time to time, the Website may engage in&nbsp;remarketing&nbsp;efforts with third-party companies, such as Google, Facebook, or Instagram, in order to market the Website. These companies use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits to the Website.</p>
<p>Affiliate Program Participation</p>
<p>The Website may engage in affiliate marketing, which is done by embedding tracking links into the Website. If you click on a link for an affiliate partnership, a cookie will be placed on your browser to track any sales for purposes of commissions.
