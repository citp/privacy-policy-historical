						<p><span class="title"><i>THE WEEKLY STANDARD</i> PRIVACY POLICY</span></p>

						<p><i>The Weekly Standard</i> is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of Privacy Principles applicable to all its U.S.-based companies.  <i>The Weekly Standard</i> has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information ("PII") we obtain from and about individuals located in the U.S.</p>

						<p>From time to time <i>The Weekly Standard</i> may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, technology or industry initiatives.</p>

						<p><u><b>COLLECTION:</b> COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ("PII") BY <i>THE WEEKLY STANDARD</i></u></p>

						<p><u>General.</u> <i>The Weekly Standard</i> collects personally identifiable information ("PII" -- that is, information such as your full name, email address, mailing address or telephone number) when you voluntarily submit the information to us in order to subscribe to <i>The Weekly Standard</i> or our online newsletter, to participate in activities like surveys, polls, forums, chats or bulletin boards, to register for activities on our web site, or because you want us to furnish you with products, services or information. On those occasions when we obtain PII from a third party, we use only reputable sources of such information.</p>

						<p><u>Cookies.</u> Cookies are small bits of information that the Internet site operated by <i>The Weekly Standard</i> places on the hard drive of your computer.  Cookies remember information about your activities on our site and enable <i>The Weekly Standard</i> to make your visits to our site more enjoyable.  For example, cookies can store your password for easy logon to our site on a subsequent visit or can save your preferences for a personalized home page.  The cookie itself does not contain PII.</p>

						<p>Third party advertisements displayed on the Internet site operated by <i>The Weekly Standard</i> may also contain cookies.  <i>The Weekly Standard</i> does not control these advertiser cookies and visitors to our web site should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies.</p>

						<p>You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.</p>

						<p><u>NOTICE:</u> <i>THE WEEKLY STANDARD</i> WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES</p>

						<p>When <i>The Weekly Standard</i> collects PII from you, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses <i>The Weekly Standard</i> will make of the information.</p>

						<p>This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore may want to share your personal information (See "Use" below).  However, <i>The Weekly Standard</i> will notify you of your options regarding our use of your personally identifiable information, including whether we can share it with outside companies (See "Choice" below).</p>

						<p>Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format, such as a post card or subscription form.  Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical.  However, the post card or form will direct consumers to <i>The Weekly Standard</i> web site where this Privacy Policy is posted.  In addition, each edition of <i>The Weekly Standard</i> provides information about where and how to access this Policy.</p>

						<p><i>The Weekly Standard</i>'s web site may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies.  <i>The Weekly Standard</i>'s web site also carries advertisements from other companies as well as advertisements placed by national Internet ad agencies.  Although we choose our business partners and advertisers carefully, <i>The Weekly Standard</i> is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our site or for the privacy practices of third party or so-called national advertisers.  Once you've left a <i>The Weekly Standard</i> site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.</p>

						<p><i>The Weekly Standard</i>'s web site may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with <i>The Weekly Standard</i>.  Visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Policy.</p>

						<p><u><b>CHOICE:</b> <i>THE WEEKLY STANDARD</i> WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII</u></p>

						<p><i>The Weekly Standard</i> will provide you with the opportunity to choose whether your PII may be used for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted.  You will also be able to instruct us not to share your PII with companies that are not affiliated with <i>The Weekly Standard</i> (i.e., not part of the News America Group).</p>

						<p><u><b>USE:</b> <i>THE WEEKLY STANDARD</i>'S USE OF PII</u></p>

						<p><i>The Weekly Standard</i> will use your PII in a manner that is consistent with this Policy and only for the purpose for which it is submitted, unless other uses are disclosed at the time of collection and you allow us to use your information in these other ways.</p>

						<p><i>The Weekly Standard</i> may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us—i.e., those that are among the News America Group of companies.  <i>The Weekly Standard</i> may also share your PII with companies that are not affiliated with <i>The Weekly Standard</i>, but would like to send you information about their products and services.  For example, our subscriber list may be shared with other publications you might be interested in receiving. If you do not want your name included on lists shared with third parties, please write us a note indicating your desire in this matter and enclose the mailing label from one of the issues you have received as a subscriber. Send your letter to Customer Service, <i>The Weekly Standard</i>, 1150 17th St. N.W., Suite 505, Washington, D.C., 20036.</p>

						<p><i>The Weekly Standard</i> employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII.  Outside contractors or agents who help us to fulfill your subscription to our magazine or to manage other activities that involve the collection of PII may only use PII to provide <i>The Weekly Standard</i> with a specific service and not for any other purpose.</p>

						<p>If <i>The Weekly Standard</i> obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of this information is governed by this Policy.</p>

						<p><i>The Weekly Standard</i> may be required to disclose PII to comply with legal requirements, such as a court order, and to protect the safety and security of visitors to our web sites.</p>

						<p><u><b>SECURITY:</b> <i>THE WEEKLY STANDARD</i> PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII</u></p>

						<p><i>The Weekly Standard</i> uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.  In addition, <i>The Weekly Standard</i> uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete.</p>

						<p><u><b>ACCESS:</b> HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT OR DELETE YOUR PII</u></p>

						<p>If you want to review the PII <i>The Weekly Standard</i> has collected from you, change or correct your PII or stop all future subscriptions or communications from <i>The Weekly Standard</i>, please click on Customer Services or write Customer Service, <i>The Weekly Standard</i>. 1150 17th S. N.W., Suite 505, Washington, D.C., 20036.</p>

						<p><u><b>REMEDIES AND COMPLIANCE:</b> HOW TO CONTACT <i>THE WEEKLY STANDARD</i> ABOUT PRIVACY CONCERNS</u></p>

						<p>If you want to contact <i>The Weekly Standard</i> about this Privacy Policy, or our collection and use of your PII, please write Customer Service, <i>The Weekly Standard</i>, 1150 17th St. N.W., Suite 505, Washington, D.C., 20036.</p>
