                                        <p class="pageText"><strong>Other Tracking Devices.</strong> We use other industry standard technologies like pixel tags and web beacons to track your use of our Website pages and promotions, and allow our Third Party Service Providers to use these devices on our behalf. Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on certain pages on our Website, or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click an email, pixel tags and web beacons generate a Non-Personally Identifiable notice of that action. Pixel tags allow us to measure and improve our understanding of visitor traffic and behavior on our Website, as well as give us a way to measure our promotions and performance. We may also utilize pixel tags and web beacons provided by our Affiliates and/or Marketing Partners for the same purposes.</p>

                                        <h3>9. WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION YOU SHARE</h3>

                                        <p class="pageText">When you join WeeklyPlus.com, you provide us with your contact information, including your full name and email address.

                                        <p class="pageText"><strong>We may share your information with Authorized Third Party Service Providers.</strong> We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, process payments, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>

                                        <p class="pageText"><strong>We may share your information in a Business Transfer.</strong> As with any other business, we could merge with, or be acquired by another company. If this occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain, including Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally Identifiable Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>

                                        <p class="pageText"><strong>We may share your information for our Protection and the Protection of Others.</strong> WeeklyPlus.com will disclose your Personal Information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on WeeklyPlus.com or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of WeeklyPlus.com and its family or Websites, and, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of WeeklyPlus.com, its Websites, or the public.</p>

                                        <p class="pageText"><strong>Public Areas.</strong> We may provide areas on our Website where you can publicly post information about yourself, can communicate with others, or can review products, restaurants, and submit media content. This information may be accessible by other consumers and companies and may appear on other websites or web searches, and therefore this information could be read, collected, and used by others. For example, if you post your email address along with a public restaurant review, you may receive unsolicited messages. We have no control over who reads your postings or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so please use caution when posting any personal information.</p>
