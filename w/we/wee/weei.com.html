Policy Statement from Entercom Communications</font></b><br>
<br>
The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices 
for Entercom Radio Station web properties. For a complete list of all Entercom 
radio station web sites, please visit <a href="http://www.entercom.com" target="_blank">www.entercom.com</a>. 
</font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Privacy Policies</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Information Collection 
	- When you browse any Entercom radio station Web site, you do so anonymously. 
	Personal information -- including your e-mail address -- is not automatically 
	collected. Some of our Web sites, however, may request that you voluntarily 
	supply us with personal information, including your E-mail address for purposes 
	of participating in correspondence, site registration, streaming player registration, 
	membership, making a purchase, contests, online surveys, to contact you as 
	part of a promotion, to meet legal requirements, to keep you informed about 
	products and services in which you may have an interest, and/or to analyze 
	the collected information and use this data for contacts by research firms. 
	For these types of activities we may require your name, e-mail address, gender, 
	zipcode, birthdate or other information. Other optional information may be 
	asked (listener/customer preference information, mailing address, telephone 
	numbers, lifestyle interests, and other demographic information).</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like many other commercial 
  Web sites, some Entercom web sites may use a standard technology called a "cookie" 
  to collect information about how our site is used. Please read About Cookies 
  below for more information.</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We give listeners/customers 
	access to their data online. A listener/customer may change, update or add 
	additional information about themselves at any time through our radio stations' 
	web sites, which offer this feature. If a station does not currently provide 
	this ability, listeners/customers can still change their data profile by contacting 
	the local station. All Entercom radio stations will provide this feature in 
	the near future. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We attempt to limit access 
	to listener/customer data to those who specifically need it to conduct their 
	business with the company. While we use security techniques designed to protect 
	our listener/customer data, given constantly changing technologies that may 
	exist, we do not guarantee the security of our listener/customer data. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We anonymously track 
	visitor usage of our sites for general marketing purposes, such as determining 
	what information is of most and least interest to visitors, and for other 
	purposes such as determining the site's technical design specifications and 
	identifying system performance or problem areas. We track this activity utilizing 
	an out-sourced product, WebTrends Live, from WebTrends Corporation.. The Privacy 
	Statement for Visitors to Sites Tracked by WebTrends Live can be found at:

</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
  <b>Information Use </b><br>
  If you provide us with your E-mail address, or have done so in the past, we 
  may send you E-mail offers, surveys, newsletters or other types of contacts. 
  These are based on information you provided in your membership application, 
  registration forms, in surveys, from information that may indicate purchasing 
  preferences and lifestyle, as well as information available from external sources, 
  such as census bureau data.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We use information generally 
  to compile statistical and user profile data, to perform research using the 
  compiled data including disclosure of user information to research firms retained 
  by WRKO, to keep in contact with users and provide them with a better interactive 
  experience. We may use your information specifically for the following purposes: 
  to provide easy access every time you return to the site without requiring re-entry 
  of registration information; to keep you informed about products and services 
  in which you may have interest; to complete business transactions; to contact 
  you as part of a promotion; to allow you to make a posting on the Site; to administer 
  individual accounts; to provide customer support; to meet legal requirements; 
  to provide Internet security; and/or to analyze the collected information and 
  use this data for contacts by research firms. Also, in the event that company 
  or the radio station is involved in a sale of a substantial portion of our business 
  assets, listener/customer information may be among the transferred assets. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We work closely with our 
  business partners and certain other third parties who may perform functions 
  on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, providing promotional materials to 
  our users, sending e-mail, managing data, processing credit card payments or 
  providing customer service. They have access to your personal information only 
  to the extent necessary to perform their functions and may not use it for any 
  other purpose. Further, these business partners and other third parties may 
  from time to time wish to extend special offers to you on their own behalf. 
  We may use your personal information to assist our business partners in offering 
  you these products, services and information and may act as an intermediary 
  (for instance, sending you e-mail on their behalf). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The data you provide is 
  used to enhance the services and offers our radio stations bring you. As a result 
  of providing personal information, Entercom radio stations can provide a more 
  customized online experience, making your interaction with us more productive, 
  helpful and fun. You can also expect to receive occasional communications targeted 
  directly toward your lifestyle interests. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
  Declining E-mail Offers - Entercom provides listeners/customers with an easy 
  means to decline receiving E-mail offers and recognizes the importance of providing 
  you with choices. At any time, you may request to discontinue receiving these 
  offers from us by simply replying to the E-mail address included in every e-mail 
  message you receive from an Entercom radio station. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other Activity Tracking 
  Some radio stations do monitor click-throughs to URL's found in our email messages. 
  The click-through rate is reviewed in order to: track participation in contests 
  in order to judge effectiveness and to award prizes; track listener interests; 
  track response rates for station marketing purposes or to report to a client 
  in aggregate form only, the response of listeners. Individual activity is never 
  shared with employees or third parties. <br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Children Entercom does not 
  knowingly solicit data from children, and we will not knowingly market to children. 
  Entercom adheres to COPPA - the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Our 
  websites are general audience websites which are not directed to children generally, 
  including children under the age of 13. It is our policy to discard any information 
  which is obtained from any child who is under the age of 13. · What else 
  should I know about my privacy? Third party Internet sites and services accessible 
  through Entercom radio stations have separate privacy and data collection practices, 
  independent of us. Entercom has no responsibility or liability for these independent 
  policies or actions. In addition, you are solely responsible for maintaining 
  the secrecy of your passwords, membership ID, or any account information. Please 
  be careful and responsible whenever you are online. If you post personal information 
  online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages 
  from other parties in return. While we aim to protect your personal information, 
  Entercom cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit 
  to us, and you do so at your own risk. <br>
  <br>
  We will make all reasonable efforts to adhere to the above privacy standards. 
  However, the policy should not be construed as a contractual undertaking. Additional 
  restrictions may be imposed to comply with state and local laws, and/or station 
  specific programs, products and services. Entercom reserves the right to alter, 
  amend or supplement the privacy standards at anytime.</font></p>
