        Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h1>

                </div>
                
    <p>
        Our customers’ confidence in our ability to provide premier financial services while
        preserving the integrity of their personal information is the cornerstone of WesBanco’s
        success and reputation. As technology enhances our ability to deliver our services
        in new and innovative ways, we understand your concerns of how this development
        may impact your personal privacy. We recognize our responsibility not only to protect
        the financial assets entrusted to us, but also to respect the privacy expectations
        of our customers. Our commitment to that responsibility is outlined in our adoption
        of the following privacy principles:
    </p>
    <h1>
        Recognition of a Customer's Expectation of Privacy</h1>
    <p>
        Your privacy is important to us. We recognize your personal interest in understanding
        how we do business - in understanding how we will collect, retain, and use the personal
        information we request from you. By publishing this privacy policy, we hope to address
        those concerns and instill confidence in our existing and potential customers that
        WesBanco has sufficient standards and security measures in place to prevent the
        misuse of any personal information provided to us. We will continually re-evaluate
        these standards to ensure your privacy is respected. We welcome your questions and
        comments.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h1>
        What Information We Collect</h1>
    <p>
        We may collect “nonpublic personal information” about you from the following sources:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Information we receive from you on applications or other loan and account forms,
            such as your name, address, social security number, assets and income; .</li>
        <li>Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates or others, such as your
            account balance, payment history, parties to transactions, and credit card usage;
            and .</li>
        <li>Information we receive from credit reporting agencies, such as your creditworthiness
            and credit history. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        “Nonpublic personal information” is nonpublic information about you that we obtain
        in connection with providing a financial product or service to you. For example,
        nonpublic personal information includes information regarding your account balance,
        payment history, and overdraft history.
    </p>
    <h1>
        What Information We Disclose
    </h1>
    <p>
        We are permitted under law to share information about our experiences or transactions
        with you or your account (such as your account balance and your payment history
        with us) with companies related to us by common control or ownership (“affiliates”).
    </p>
    <p>
        We also are permitted under law to disclose nonpublic personal information about
        you to “nonaffiliated third parties” (i.e., third parties that are not members of
        our corporate family) in certain circumstances. For example, we may disclose nonpublic
        personal information about you to such third parties to assist us in servicing your
        loan or account with us; to government entities in response to subpoenas; and to
        credit bureaus. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you
        to any other third parties, except as permitted by law.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to companies
        that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions
        with which we have joint marketing agreements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Otherwise, we do not share customer information with outside companies for purposes
        of selling their products and services to you. We do not sell “customer lists” to
        outside companies.

    <h1>
        Maintenance of Accurate Information
    </h1>
    <p>
        WesBanco is committed to maintaining the integrity of your financial information.
        We have developed procedures to ensure our customer records are accurate, current,
        and complete in accordance with reasonable commercial standards. Our employees are
        prepared to respond to your requests to correct inaccurate information in a timely
        manner. You may direct such requests to: WesBanco, Attn: Bank Operations, 1 Bank
        Plaza, Wheeling, WV, 26003, or to the address and telephone number provided on your
        monthly statement. Additionally, when you open certain types of accounts with us,
        we will provide you with disclosures outlining specific procedures for you to follow
        should you find an error or unauthorized transaction on your account. These disclosures
        are also available through our online banking service, WesBancoNet.
    </p>
    <h1>
        Limiting Employee Access to Information
    </h1>
    <p>
        As stated previously, WesBanco will only use personal customer information for legitimate
        business purposes. This extends to limiting your personally identifiable information
        to those WesBanco employees with a business reason to know such information about
        you. We educate our employees on the importance of customer privacy. We have outlined
        our standards for employee confidentiality in our corporate Personnel Policies and
        Procedure Manual provided to each employee. Breaches of our confidentiality principles
        are grounds for disciplinary action against the employee.
    </p>
    <h1>
        Protection of Information via Established Security Procedures
    </h1>
    <p>
        WesBanco continually maintains and updates appropriate security standards and procedures
        regarding unauthorized access to customer information. We are committed to utilizing
        the newest technologies to enhance these standards and to keep the information you
        provide to us secure and confidential. All of our operational and data processing
        systems are in a secure environment that protects your account information from
        being accessed by third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        To read more about the security of information you provide to us through our website,
        <a href="http://www.wesbanco.com">www.wesbanco.com</a> and through our online banking service, WesBancoNet, please access

        Children Visiting Our Web Site
    </h1>
    <p>
        Our web site and online banking services are designed to provide information and
        deliver products and services to current and prospective customers of WesBanco.
        We anticipate the users of our electronic banking options to be adults, and we limit
        access to WesBancoNet to account holders over the age of sixteen. Our web site may
        be viewed by the general public and could be accessed by a child, although we are
        confident that none of the information available would be considered objectionable.
        We will not knowingly solicit or gather personal identifying information from a
        child. Should a child e-mail us from our web site to ask a question or to request
        product or service information, and we have knowledge that the request was from
        a child under the age of thirteen, the child’s e-mail address would be retained
        only for the time period and purpose of responding to the request.
    </p>
    <p>
        Parents may exercise control over which areas of the Internet their children access
        by utilizing the variety of software packages and computer technologies currently
        available for that purpose.
    </p>
    <h1>
        Our Commitment to your Privacy - Disclosure of Privacy Principles to Customers
    </h1>
    <p>
        WesBanco is committed to protecting the confidentiality of the personal information
        you share with us and in keeping you informed of the privacy and security principles
        we adopt to do so. You can expect this commitment to extend equally whether you
        visit us in person, over the telephone, or through our website or online banking
        service.
    </p>
    <p>
        This privacy policy applies to personal information gathered and used in your covered
        transactions with WesBanco companies that are for personal, family, or household
        purposes, as required by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and any implementing regulation.
        These companies include WesBanco Bank, Inc., WesBanco Trust and Investment Services,
        WesBanco Securities, Inc., WesBanco Insurance Services, and Hometown Finance Company.
        This policy is subject to change at any time without prior notice given to you unless
        otherwise required by law or regulation. If any change would result in you having
        the right to “opt out” of information sharing as provided for in any law or regulation,
        i.e., to direct us not to share your information, you would be given a reasonable
        time to exercise this right prior to the revised policy becoming effective.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you decide to close your account(s) or become an inactive customer, we will continue
        to adhere to the privacy policies and practices described in this notice.
