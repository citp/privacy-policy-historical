# West Privacy Policy–Law Books and Legal Information–West

West, a Thomson Reuters business, is committed to fair information practices. West respects the privacy and security of our users. Our goal is to provide you with a personalized Internet experience that delivers the information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to you. 

In order to achieve this goal, we sometimes collect information during your visits to understand what differentiates you from each of our millions of other users. We will not disclose it to any person or organization outside Thomson Reuters, except as described in this Privacy Policy. 

To demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we have prepared this statement disclosing our privacy practices. Here, you will learn what personal identifying information of yours is collected, how and when we might use your information, how we protect your information, who has access to your information, and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. 

## Information We Collect and How We Use It

West collects certain information from and about its users three ways: from our Web server logs, with cookies, and directly from the user. 

Web server logs: When you visit our West websites, we may track information to administer the site and analyze its usage. Examples of information we may track include: 

  1. Your Internet protocol address
  2. What kind of browser or computer you use
  3. The number of links you click within the site
  4. The state or country from which you accessed the site
  5. The date and time of your visit
  6. The name of your Internet service provider
  7. The Web page you linked to our site from
  8. The pages you viewed on the site



Cookies: Our websites use cookies (i.e., small bits of text that our servers place into a file on your computer's hard drive). This is used to save your preferences and login information, and provide personalized functionality. We use third-party advertising technology to provide you with information about our products when you visit this website. This technology uses information derived from unique visits and page views on the site to identify product promotions that may be of interest to you. In order to provide you with relevant promotions, a unique third-party cookie or cookies may be placed on your browser. To opt out of this service, please call West Customer Service at 1-800-328-4880. You can reject cookies by changing your browser settings, but be aware that this will disable some of the functionality on our websites. 

Personal information provided by the user: On some of our websites, visitors can register to purchase products or services, receive personalized content, and participate in surveys or contests. When you register, we will ask you for some personal information. 

If you're purchasing a product, we'll request financial information (e.g., What is your credit card number?). Any financial information we collect is used only to bill you for the products and services you purchased. If you purchase by credit card, this information may be forwarded to your credit card provider. 

For other types of registrations, we will ask for your name, address, email address, or telephone number. We may then contact you with information about other West products and services. 

Finally, you may be asked to disclose personal information to us so that we can provide assistance and information to you. For example, we may collect personal information from you (such as an email address, system information, and problem descriptions) in order to provide online technical support and troubleshooting. 

If you don't want to receive promotional materials from West or our marketing partners, you can opt out at any time. You simply need to update your preferences with each West service to which you are registered. Here's how: 

  * FindLaw & West Legal Directory: send an email message to [ wld.update@thomson.com](mailto:wld.update@thomson.com) Include your name and contact information, and a message saying you'd like to stop receiving promotional materials
  * West and Westlaw: update your preferences on [ this site](https://web.archive.org/store/promotions/newsletterssignin.aspx)
