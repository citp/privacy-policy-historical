# Westmonster: Privacy Policy

**MessyMedia Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy covers all titles published by Messy Media Ltd. The policy applies while you are visiting any of our sites. If you have any questions, please email us at info (at) messymedia.net.

**Personal information (including email address and website addresses)**

There are various places on our sites when you are asked for personal information, including email addresses and personal website URLs. We agree that we will never share this personal information with any third party and that we will remove your information, as specified by you, from our systems at your request. 

We may also allow users to sign up for some services using third party services such as TypeKey and OpenID. Where a user chooses to use one of these services, they will be subject to the particular service’s own privacy policy.

We may email you as needed to perform administrative tasks related to your account.

**Comments and discusson**

On most of our sites, users are able to post comments on posts. In order to post, users are required to enter a certain amount of personal information (see “Personal Information”, above). Any information we gather is only for the purposes of authenticating users and ensuring a high quality user experience for other users. We also allow users to register using certain third party services (again, see “Personal Information”, above).

Comments and discussion are subject to our terms of service. Where a particular comment or discussion post requires MessyMedia to take action, particularly as a result of a legal request from a third party, we may have to contact the user for more information or, in some cases, hand over the user’s information to a third party. This will only be done as the result of a court order or legal or police action.

**Cookies**

Our websites may place cookies on your computer to save your individual preferences (such as your personal information when making comments). These cookies and their associated data are not shared with any third parties. You can still use our sites with your cookies disabled, though you may find this a less attractive user experience. To find out more about cookies, visit this Wikipedia page: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie>

**Third Party Cookies**

There are two other types of cookies, both supplied by third parties, which may be placed on your computer when using MessyMedia titles:

Our advertisers and advertising agents may place cookies on your computer for the purposes of campaign management, to track things like the number of times an ad has been shown and how many people have seen it. These cookies are subject to the privacy policies of our advertisers, and MessyMedia does have to collect this data.

We use Google Analytics to measure traffic to our websites. Google Analytics places its own cookies on your computer for this purpose. This is subject to Google’s own privacy policy, which you can find at <http://www.google.co.uk/privacy.html>

**Log files and server data**

As you use the site, our web servers will record some basic information, in common with almost all other websites. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, the type of browser being used, the internet service provider (ISP), the page which referred you to our site, the type of operating system being used, the date and time of the activity. None of this information is linked to personally identifiable data.

**Legal and police action**

Notwithstanding what we say above, MessyMedia is bound by the laws of the countries in which it does business. When subject to a police order or court action, MessyMedia may be forced to hand over your personal information to the authorities.

**Change of ownership**

If Messy Media Ltd. is acquired by or merges with another firm, the assets of our websites, including personal information, may be transferred to the new owners and, if so, will become subject to their own privacy policy.

**Changing this policy**

Messy Media Ltd. reserves the right to, unilaterally and without advance notice, make changes to this privacy policy, as and when desired or needed. If changes are made, we will post them here and show the date of the changes.

**Contact Information**

If you have any questions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at info (at) messymedia.net.
