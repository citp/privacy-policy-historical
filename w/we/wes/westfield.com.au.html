</ul>
<p><span style="line-height: 22.4px;">We are collecting this information (and may use or hold this information) for the following purposes:</span><br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>so that we can tell which web pages are the most popular and where shoppers spend most of their time;</li>
<li>to improve our website or in-Centre experience;</li>
<li>for the purposes of and incidental to your use of in-Centre Wi-Fi services (if applicable);</li>
<li>to measure and analyse shopping behaviour in order to improve our centres and otherwise in connection with our business;</li>
<li>to send to you special deals and discounts, surveys and other marketing materials based on your location or known web usage;</li>
<li>for other purposes to which you, either expressly or impliedly, consent to, and for the purposes set out in these terms and conditions, we may provide this information to Scentre Group’s agents, contractors, service providers, joint venture and commercial partners and regulatory authorities, and may transfer your personal information to others in countries outside Australia and New Zealand (including to those that operate our cloud servers outside of Australia and New Zealand).</li>
</ul>
<p>Scentre Group may use the anonymised data for the purposes set out above and to inform our promotional and marketing strategies, as well as research and profiling purposes including customer demographics, interests and behaviours based on personal information and other information provided to us.&nbsp; This research may be compiled and analysed on an aggregate basis, and we may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may also disclose aggregated information in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>
<p>Scentre Group may connect information you provide to us for one purpose with other information for use for one or more of the above purposes.&nbsp; If you access or log-in to an in-Centre Wi-Fi service, and we already hold other information (both personal or non-personal) that can be associated to you or the device on which you are accessing the Wi-Fi service (including, but not limited to a device ID number (MAC address)), then that information may be linked with personal information we hold about you as set out in this policy, and will be treated in the same manner as the personal information to which it has been linked.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Who collects the information</b></p>
<p>Personal information collected about individuals (as described above) may be collected by, or on behalf of:</p>
<ul>

<p><span style="line-height: 22.4px;">We will use all reasonable endeavours to keep your personal information in a secure environment, however, this security cannot be guaranteed due to the nature of the Internet.&nbsp; These measures are designed to assist in your personal information not being accessed by unauthorised personnel, lost or misused.&nbsp; If you reasonably believe that there has been unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information please contact us (see below).</span><br>
</p>

<p><b style="line-height: 22.4px;">Advertisers and Partners on Scentre Group Websites</b><br>
</p>
<p>Scentre may allow advertising on its Site from time to time. Once you have clicked on an advertisement and have left the Site, our privacy policy no longer applies. You must read the privacy policy of the advertiser or subsequently visited site to see how your personal information will be handled on those sites. In addition, many business advertisements may be managed and placed on our Site by third-party companies. These "network advertisers" collect non-personal information when you click on or scan one of their banner advertisements. The information is collected using technology, so you may not realise it is being collected. The network advertisers collect this information so that they may show you ads that are more relevant or interesting to you.</p>
<p>On occasion the Site may also provide content that is created by a third-party partner website. In some instances the third-party sites will collect information in order to facilitate the transaction or to make the use of their content more productive and efficient. In these circumstances, the information collected is shared between Scentre and our third-party sponsors.</p>
