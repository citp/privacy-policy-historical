– Name;   
– Surname;

All documents sent to OP for the purposes set out by this Privacy Policy will be stored in electronic and/or paper databases for all the time necessary for the purposes for which they have been requested/sent. These documents will not be made accessible to the public, except upon a reasoned request by the competent authority.
