Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you.

Please take a look at your particular browser for instructions on this function. You may also wish to refer to <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html>.

If we combine Other Information with PII, we will treat the combined information as PII while it is combined.

**Interest-Based Ads and Online Tracking**

We may partner with third-party service providers to serve ads regarding goods or services that may be of interest to you when you access and use the Site and third party-sites. Some of the ads on this Site or on third party sites may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on what we or the online advertising network serving the ad know about you or your computer's browsing activity on both the Site and third-party sites. To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (including through the use of pixel tags).

The Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about internet advertising companies, including information about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by their members. See [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) for general information about the NAI and <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp> for the opt-out page. You may also visit <http://www.aboutads.info/consumers/> to learn about interest-based advertising and how to opt-out from ads served by some or all participating companies.

These opt-out mechanisms rely on cookies to remember your choices. If you delete your cookies, use another computer or device, or change browsers, you will need to repeat this process. In addition, opting out of interest-based ads will not opt you out of all ads, but rather only those ads that are personalized to your interests.

**Third Party Services**

This Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site or service to which the Site links. The inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply our or our affiliates’ endorsement of the linked site or service.

Please note that we are not responsible for the collection, usage and disclosure policies and practices (including the data security practices) of other organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, RIM or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider or device manufacturer, including any PII you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with our Social Media Pages.

**How can I access or correct my information?**

If you would like us to correct or delete PII that you have provided to us in connection with your use of this Site, please contact us at [privacy@wdc.com](mailto:privacy@wdc.com), and we will endeavor to respond in a reasonable time. We will make a good faith effort to provide you with access to your PII and to correct any inaccuracy or delete such information, at your request, if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. There may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed. We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical or for which access is not otherwise required. For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the PII associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request.

**How do we protect your information?**

We have implemented reasonable security measures and practices in an effort to protect the confidentiality of your PII. However, no security system is impenetrable. It may be possible for third parties to intercept or access information that you provide to WDC. WDC cannot guarantee the security of your information, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to WDC. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password(s), computer and WDC Products. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting use in accordance with the “How to Contact Us” section below.

**Children**

We do not knowingly solicit data from, or market to, children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personal information, he or she should contact us at [privacy@wdc.com](mailto:privacy@wdc.com).We will take reasonable steps to delete such information from our database within a reasonable time.
