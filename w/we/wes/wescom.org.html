 <h1>Wescom Credit Union and Wescom Financial Services, LLC Disclosure of Privacy Policy</h1>
 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p>Wescom Credit Union is a member-owned financial cooperative. You
   joined the Credit Union with the expectation that we act in the best
   interest of our membership and make available the financial products
   and services that enable you to meet your financial goals. Trust is the
   foundation of our relationship with you, and the preservation of that
   trust is of the highest importance to us. It is with that purpose in mind
   that we have formulated our privacy policy. Both Wescom Credit
   Union ("Credit Union") and Wescom Financial Services, LLC ("WFS")
   want you to understand what information we collect, how we use it
   and with whom we share it. We will inform you annually about our
   privacy policy.<br>
   <br>
   This joint policy applies to both current and former Wescom members,
   and addresses the disclosure of personal information about you that
   may not be available in public records. We use the terms "affiliate"
   and "non-affiliate" to describe companies with which we may share
   your information. An "affiliate" is one which either the Credit Union
   or WFS directly or indirectly owns or over which we have control. As
   WFS is indirectly controlled by the Credit Union, both the Credit
   Union and WFS are affiliates of each other. A "non-affiliate" is a third
   party with whom we may have a business or marketing relationship
   and who may perform services on our, or your behalf.
 </p>
 <h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
 <p>We collect personal information directly from you in the course of
  providing you our products and services. We collect your personal
  information from you, your applications, your transactions with us and
  with non-affiliated third parties, consumer reporting agencies and by
  verifying your information. The type of information we collect is about
  your identity (name, address, date of birth, driver's license number,
  social security number); your transaction history with us, our affiliates,
  or others (account balances, payment history, credit card usage); and
  your assets, income and creditworthiness. We collect your personal
  information in order to provide you with products and services you
  request; to know who you are and prevent unauthorized access to
  your information; to offer products and services that are of value to
  you; and to comply with the regulations that govern us.</p>
 <h2>What Information We Disclose</h2>
 <p>We will not sell, share, give or otherwise provide your personal
information to any non-affiliated third party for the marketing of their
products and services. We may share your personal information as
described above with our affiliates and in accordance with the Fair
Credit Reporting Act referred to below. In addition, we may offer to
our members the products and services of a non-affiliated third party, but the Credit Union and/or WFS will market those products and
services directly to you. We will not provide the non-affiliated third
party with information about you unless you request it or initiate a
transaction. We choose our third party service providers carefully, and
enter into contractual agreements with them to ensure that the
information you give directly to them is used only to provide you with
the service you requested. In accordance with our contractual
agreements, third parties may not use any of the information we
provide to them to market their products or services directly to you.</p>
<p>We are permitted by law to share any of the information we collect
with non-affiliated third parties to administer the products and services
we provide, to follow your instructions, to meet our business needs, or
to comply with state and federal law. You cannot opt out of the
disclosure of this information. Examples of these third parties are
financial service providers such as financial advisors, securities brokerdealers,
and insurance companies and agents; non-financial service
providers such as credit bureaus, check printers, mail houses,
marketing service providers; and others such as courts and state and
federal government agencies. In addition, we may also disclose
information about you to other non-affiliated third parties not
described in this policy as permitted or required by law. Please be
assured that we will only share information with non-affiliated third
parties to the extent required or permitted by law.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ("FCRA"), we may share
information about your transactions and experiences with us with our
affiliates. The types of companies within our Credit Union family of
affiliates include financial service providers, such as WFS, Wescom
Insurance Services, and Hallmark (an insurance agency). The types of
companies within our WFS family of affiliates include financial service
providers, such as Wescom Credit Union, Wescom Insurance Services,
and Hallmark (an insurance agency).</p>
 <p><b>YOUR RIGHT TO OPT-OUT</b></p>
     <p>If you do not wish for us to share your information with our affiliates, you have the right to opt out at any time. If you wish to opt out, you may do so in any one of the following ways:</p>
 <ul>
   <li><a href="https://ebranch.wescom.org/?DestinationPage=/ebranch/options/HBPromotionalPref.aspx">Log in to eBranch by following this link</a>. It will take you directly to your Promotional Preferences page. Click on the Affiliate Opt-Out tab and make your choice. </li>
   <li>Print the <a href="info_optout.asp">opt-out form, available online</a>, fill it out and return it to Wescom at 123 South Marengo Avenue, Pasadena , CA 91101. </li>
   <li>Print the <a href="info_optout.asp">opt-out form</a>, fill it out and fax it to 1-866-793-7266. </li>
 </ul>
 <p>Your opt-out will remain effective for five years or until revoked in writing. Please note that even if you opt out, we will continue to share
     your information to conduct our business as described above, to the
     extent permitted by law.</p>
 <p><b>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</b></p>
     <p>We maintain physical, electronic and procedural controls that comply with federal regulations to guard your information. We restrict access to your personal information to those employees who need it in order
     to provide products and services to you. Where appropriate, we use
     security encoding techniques to protect against unauthorized access
     to personal records, ensure accuracy and integrity of data, and protect
     your confidentiality. We provide training to educate employees on the
     purpose and implementation of procedures related to privacy and the
     confidentiality of member data.</p>
     <p><b>CHANGES TO OUR POLICY</b></p>
     <p>This privacy policy replaces all previous privacy policies. We reserve the
     right to revise our policies as our business needs change or as the law
     requires. If we revise our policies, we will provide our members with
     copies of our new policies at that time.</p>
     <p><b>RESTRICTING CREDIT OFFERS, DIRECT MAIL AND<br>
     TELEMARKETING SOLICITATIONS</b></p>
     <p>Businesses can obtain information about you from public records such
     as those available at County Recorders. They may use this information
     to market their services, and sometimes make reference to your Credit
     Union. Wescom cannot control or restrict the use of publicly available
     information about you, and we do not authorize these businesses to
     use our name. However, there are steps you can take to minimize
     these and other types of direct mail solicitations.</p>
 <p><b>CREDIT SOLICITATIONS</b></p>
 <p>You may contact credit reporting agencies directly and ask that your
     name be removed from unsolicited credit offers. By doing this, you will
     no longer receive credit offers from credit card companies and financial
     institutions, including Wescom.</p>
