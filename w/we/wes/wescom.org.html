 <h1>Wescom Credit Union and Wescom Financial Services, LLC Disclosure of Privacy Policy</h1>
 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p>Wescom Credit Union is a member-owned financial cooperative. You joined the Credit Union with the expectation that we act in the best interest of our membership and make available the financial products and services that enable you to meet your financial goals. Trust is the foundation of our relationship with you, and the preservation of that trust is of the highest importance to us. It is with that purpose in mind that we have formulated our privacy policy. Both Wescom Credit Union ("Credit Union") and Wescom Financial Services, LLC ("WFS") want you to understand what information we collect, how we use it and with whom we share it. We will inform you annually about our privacy policy. </p>
 <p>This joint policy applies to both current and former Wescom members, and addresses the disclosure of personal information about you that may not be available in public records. We use the terms "affiliate" and "non-affiliate" to describe companies with which we may share your information. An "affiliate company" is one which either the Credit Union or WFS owns or over which we have control. As WFS is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Credit Union, both the Credit Union and WFS are affiliates of each other. A "non-affiliate" is a third party with which we have a business or marketing relationship and performs services on our or your behalf. </p>
 <h2>What Information We Collect </h2>
 <p>We collect personal information directly from you in the course of providing you our products and services.  We collect your personal information from you, your applications, your transactions, consumer reporting agencies and the verification of your information. The type of information we collect is about your identity (name, address, date of birth, driver's license number, social security number); your transaction history with us, our affiliates, or others (account balances, payment history, credit card usage); and your assets, income and creditworthiness.</p>
 <p>We collect your personal information in order to provide you with products and services you request; to know who you are and prevent unauthorized access to your information; to offer products and services that are of value to you; and to comply with the regulations that govern us. </p>
 <h2>What Information We Disclose</h2>
 <p>We will not sell, share, give or otherwise provide your personal information to any non-affiliated third party for the marketing of their products and services. We may share your personal information as described above with our affiliate organization. In addition, we may offer to our members the products and services of a non-affiliated third party, but the Credit Union and/or WFS will market those products and services directly to you, and we will not provide the non-affiliated third party with information about you. We choose third parties carefully, and enter into contractual agreements with them to ensure that the information you give directly to them is used only to provide you the service you requested. In accordance with our contractual agreements, third parties may not market their products or services directly to you. </p>
 <p>We are permitted by law to share with non-affiliated third parties the information necessary to administer the products and services we provide, to follow your instructions, to meet our business needs, or to comply with state and federal law. You cannot opt out of the disclosure of this information. Examples of these third parties are credit bureaus, check printers, mail houses, marketing service providers, courts and state and federal government agencies. Please be assured that we will only share information with non-affiliated third parties to the extent required or permitted by law.</p>
 <p>Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ("FCRA"), it is our practice to share Transaction/Experience Information (as defined by the FCRA) with our affiliates and non-affiliated third parties to the extent permitted by law and by our policies.</p>
 <h2>How We Protect Your Information </h2>
 <p>We maintain physical, electronic and procedural controls that comply with federal regulations to guard your information. We restrict access to your personal information to those employees who need it in order to provide products and services to you. Where appropriate, we use security encoding techniques to protect against unauthorized access to personal records, ensure accuracy and integrity of data, and protect your confidentiality. We provide training to educate employees on the purpose and implementation of procedures related to privacy and the confidentiality of member data. </p>
 <h2>Changes to Our Policy</h2>
 <p>We reserve the right to revise our policy as our business needs change or as the law requires. If we revise our policies, we will provide our members with copies of our new policies at that time.</p>
 <p>Restricting Credit Offers, Direct Mail and Telemarketing Solicitations <br>
	Businesses can obtain information about you from public records such as those available at County Recorders. They may use this information to market their services, and sometime make reference to your Credit Union. Wescom cannot control or restrict the use of publicly available information about you, and we do not authorize these businesses to use our name.  However, there are steps you can take to minimize these and other types of direct mail solicitations. </p>
 <h2>Credit Solicitations </h2>
 <p>You may contact credit reporting agencies directly and ask that your name be removed from unsolicited credit offers. By doing this, you will no longer receive credit offers from credit card companies and financial institutions, including Wescom. You may call (888) 5OPT-OUT or write to: </p>

	<li>We may use data about your usage of our Web site to send you promotional information;</li>
	<li>We have partners who provide you with valuable services online that we do not offer (for example, eVision Online Trading, Autoland Car Buying). They may collect information directly from you in order to administer services you have requested, and may share this information with Wescom.  We hold our partners to strict confidentiality standards, and prohibit them from giving your information to any party other than Wescom;</li>
	<li>On our Web site, we provide links to other sites; Wescom is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any Web site other than that operated by Wescom.</li>
 </ol>
