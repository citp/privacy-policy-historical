<h2>Westsiderentals.com Privacy Policy Statement</h2><br><br>

Westsiderentals.com is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please read the
following policy to understand how we collect, use and protect your information. This
policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically.
<br><br>
This policy will let you know:<br><br>

<ul>
<li>
What personally identifiable information is collected from you
</li>
<li>
What cookies are and how they are used
</li>
<li>
How your information is used

<h2>
What personally identifiable information is collected from you?
</h2>

Westsiderentals.com collects information in several ways from different parts of our web site.
<br><br>
During registration, some personal information will be requested. We ask for your name, email
address, street address, city, state/province, zip/postal code, country, and telephone number.
Although, only fields that are marked with an asterisk (*) on the registration form are required.
This information is used solely to assist you in navigating the system by automatically filling
in certain forms (such as the vacancy posting form) so you do not have to continually re-enter
your information. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to Westsiderentals.com.
The username and password created during registration will allow you to have access to all of
WestsideRentals.com services and resources.
<br><br>
In addition to information collected during registration, we may ask you for additional personal
information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you post vacancies or take
advantage of the other features of Westsiderentals.com. If you contact us, we may keep a record
of that correspondence. Every page within the Westsiderentals.com includes a link to this
Privacy Policy Statement.
<br><br>

<h2>
What cookies are and how they are used
</h2>

As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, Westsiderentals.com
may use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount
of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive.
Several features of the Westsiderentals.com require that you accept cookies in order to work
properly. (See "what choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of
your information" for more information on cookies.)
<br><br>
Generally, we use cookies for the following purposes:
<br><br>

To identify and label all "new" vacancies since your last visit to the site.
<br><br>
Optionally to permanently save your password on your computer so you don't have to re-
enter it each time you visit our site.
<br><br>
To enable you to "checklist and compare" vacancies that you want to mark for future
retrieval and viewing.
<br><br>
Advertising networks that advertise on Westsiderentals.com may also use their own cookies.
<br><br>
Westsiderentals.com may also collect IP addresses for system administration, fraud prevention,
and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.
<br><br>

<h2>
How your information is used
</h2>

The primary goal of Westsiderentals.com in collecting personal information is to provide
you, the user, with a customized experience and to assist your navigation throughout
Westsiderentals.com.
<br><br>

<h2>
Who is collecting your information?
</h2>

When you are asked for personal information on Westsiderentals.com, you are sharing that
information with Westsiderentals.com alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. However,
some activities will, by their very nature, result in your personal information being revealed to
other users of the Westsiderentals.com. For example, when you enter personal information on
the vacancy posting form, this information will generally be included in your vacancy, unless
specifically stated otherwise. Also, if you request to be contacted by one of our advertising
partners, some of your contact information may be shared.
<br><br>

<h2>With whom your information may be shared</h2>

As a general rule, Westsiderentals.com will not disclose any of your personally identifiable
information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when
we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below.
Please see the “Terms of Service” or “Use Agreements” for each of our products and services for
more detailed information about how your personal information may be shared.
<br><br>
Westsiderentals.com may disclose account information in special cases when we have reason
to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action
against someone who may be violating the “Terms of Service” of the Westsiderentals.com or
may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights
or property of Westsiderentals.com, other users of the Westsiderentals.com, or anyone else
that could be harmed by such activities. Westsiderentals.com may disclose or access account
information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and
other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and
services.
<br><br>

<h2>
What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of
your information?
</h2>
If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still use most of the
services provided by Westsiderentals.com, but you will not be able to access areas or use
features that require registration.
<br><br>
You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences,
you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject
all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those services and
features of Westsiderentals.com that require registration in order to participate. These services
include the identification of new vacancies that have been posted since your last visit, auto-
filling of the logon form, and the Favorites feature. You can still use most of the features of
Westsiderentals.com even if you do not accept cookies.
<br><br>

<h2>
How you can access, update or delete your information
</h2>
We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and
current. You may edit or delete your user profile at any time by clicking on the "My Profile" link
or graphic provided by the system once you are logged in. Once you have logged onto the system
during a given session, wherever you go on Westsiderentals.com, your information will stay
with you until or unless you click on the "Logoff" link, which is accessible from within the "My
Account" screen.
<br><br>
If you are a previously registered user and you have lost or forgotten your password, you may
obtain it by email by using our "Forgot Password" feature. Click the button on any login page to
request that your password be emailed to you. We cannot provide your password by any other
means.
<br><br>
Your Westsiderentals.com account can be deleted but, doing so will result in not being able to
access any of the features of the program that require user registration.
<br><br>
The kind of security precautions that are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or
alteration of your information
<br><br>
Other than the administrator of Westsiderentals.com or other authorized personnel of
Westsiderentals.com, you are the only person who has access to your personal information. Your
user registration is password-protected to prevent unauthorized access.
<br><br>
We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Westsiderentals.com will
never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. As
an extra security precaution, you may want to logoff once you have completed a session in
Westsiderentals.com. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and
correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public
place like a library or Internet cafe.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a
result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Westsiderentals.com cannot ensure
or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online services, and you
do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its
security on our systems.
<br><br>

<h2>
What else you should know about your online privacy
</h2>
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for
example in vacancies that you post or through email - that information can be collected and used
by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you
may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
<br><br>
Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any
account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.
<br><br>
Please note that when you communicate with landlords the email of both the landlord
and the customer will be revealed only to each other. It will not be revealed to any other
sources. By registering with our website you agree to this term.
