We will only use your personal information for a purpose it was collected for or a reasonably compatible purpose if necessary. We do not carry out automated decision making or any type of automated profiling. 

**How We Use Your Information**  
The personal information we collect and use allows us to keep you posted on the Service's features and promotions. It also helps us to improve our services, content, and advertising, as well as to provide you with a better experience. 

Any personal information or paper content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others.
