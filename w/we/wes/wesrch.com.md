**INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE**  
  
  * You provide certain personally identifiable information (such as your name and email address) to weSRCH when choosing to participate in various activities on the weSRCH Sites such as uploading papers, news releases, posting messages in our forums or in the paper comments section, entering contests or sweepstakes, taking advantage of promotions, responding to surveys, or subscribing to newsletters or other mailing lists. 

  
  
  * The personal information we collect and use allows us to keep you posted on weSRCH's features, and promotions. It also helps us to improve our services, content, and advertising, as well as to provide you with a better experience.

  
  
  * Any personal information or paper content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when you upload papers or send messages through the weSRCH Sites and other Users can contact you through messages and comments. Any papers that you submit to the weSRCH Sites may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public. When you share your content with colleagues using weSRCH, or invite others to join you on weSRCH forums, weSRCH may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.

  
  
  * From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices. Because this information is important to your interaction with weSRCH, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.

  
  
  * We may combine your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) and aggregate it with information collected from other Users to improve the quality and design of the weSRCH Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.

  
  
  * If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.

  
  
**COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES:**  
  
  * weSRCH's website, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use "cookies" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our website people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Notice. 

  
  
  * We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the weSRCH Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, page views, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.

  
  
  * weSRCH and our partners use cookies and other technologies in mobile advertising services to control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. 

  
  
  * weSRCH and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to enhance your experience at weSRCH.

  
  
  * Third parties including advertising networks and advertisers may also serve ads and these third parties may also use their own cookies.

  
  
  * Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the weSRCH Sites may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

  
  
  * As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. 

  
  
  * We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. weSRCH may use this information in our marketing and advertising services. 

  
  
  * In some of our email messages, we use a "click-through URL" linked to content on weSRCH. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.

  
  
**INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE**  
  
  * We provide non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Notice, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

  
  
  * We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) with other, third-party, companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.

  
  
  * We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the weSRCH Sites.

  
  
  * It may be necessary - by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence - for weSRCH to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. 

  
  
  * We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.
