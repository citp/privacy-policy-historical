                      WHAT DOES WESBANCO
  FACTS               DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
 Why?                Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives
                     consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how we
                     collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to understand
                     what we do.
 What?               The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service you have
                     with us. This information can include:
                           Social Security number and income
                           Assets and account balances
                           Payment history and credit history
 How?                All financial companies need to share customer personal information to run their everyday business.
                     In the section below, we list the reasons financial companies can share their customer personal
                     information; the reasons WesBanco chooses to share; and whether you can limit this sharing.
                                                                                      Does WesBanco              Can you limit this
