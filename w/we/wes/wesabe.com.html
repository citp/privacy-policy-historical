          <p class="large">This website is owned and operated by Wesabe, Inc. We have written this
    policy in order to describe the privacy practices that apply to our web
    services worldwide, and to explain how we may collect, use, and share
    information associated with these services.</p>

          <p class="large">Please take a few minutes to review this policy. If you have any
    questions or concerns about this policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@wesabe.com">support@wesabe.com</a>.</p>

          <p class="large">The effective date of this policy is: March 6, 2009.</p>

            <h3>Your options</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>You are in control:</strong> We believe strongly that you
  should be in control of what happens to your data.  We try to offer you
  choices when we ask for personal information, whenever reasonably possible,
  and we have created tools that allow you to control the amount of personally
  identifiable information shared with others.</li>
              <li><strong>User access:</strong> We make a good faith effort to provide
  you with the ability to correct your personal information at your request.
  We may, however, be forced to decline requests that are
  unreasonable, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the
  privacy of others, are otherwise impractical, or where the information is
  required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purporses.</li>

              <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> If you choose, you may decline to provide
  personal information to us and/or refuse cookies in your browser,
  although some of our features or services may not function properly as a
  result. In such cases, we would appreciate an email saying what you
  don’t like about our privacy practices, and what we can do to
  improve.</li>

            <li><strong>Deleting your account:</strong> Because we believe that your
  data is yours, and that you should be able to control it, we also allow
  you to delete your private data from our servers at any time.  Please
  note that, while some data may be preserved on backups for up to 180 days
  after it is deleted from our production servers, it will not generally be
  possible to recover data that is accidentally deleted.  Please be careful!</li>

            <h3>The Information We Collect</h3>
            <ul>
                      <li><strong>Required account information:</strong> The only information
              Wesabe requires in order to create an account is a username and a valid
              email address.  All other information is completely voluntary.  Usernames
              are used only to identify accounts, and are never shared with anyone. We
              recommend the use of anonymous email accounts for users who want to
              increase their anonymity.</li>

                      <li><strong>Optional account information:</strong> When creating an
              account, you may also choose to enter a public name, zip or postal
              code, and other information about yourself. Entering this information
              is entirely up to you: while it allows us to provide improved and
              personalized service, we respect the wishes of those who may wish to
              remain anonymous.</li>

                      <li><strong>Private information:</strong> Some features of Wesabe’s
              systems allow you to submit private information, including financial
              statements, transaction details, and access credentials to third-party
              sites.  This information is kept in the strictest confidence, and
              never shared with anyone without your consent.</li>

                      <li><strong>Aggregate information:</strong> Wesabe may combine the
              anonymous private information of many users together to form aggregate
              data such as average spending at particular merchants and spending
              patterns over time.  This aggregate information does not identify
              particular users or otherwise allow anyone to recover sensitive
              information about individual users.  Aggregate information belongs to
              Wesabe, and is not subject to this privacy policy.</li>

                      <li><strong>Publicly posted information:</strong> Wesabe offers a number
              of ways for you to communicate with other users, including the Tips,
              Groups, and Wesabe Mail systems. Please keep in mind that information
              posted on these systems may be public and accessible to others. You
              should exercise caution when deciding to post personal information in
              such forums.</li>

                      <li><strong>Technical information:</strong> Wesabe servers may record
              various pieces of technical information, such as IP addresses, browser
              versions and capabilities, or referring site addresses, whenever you
              visit one of our sites. Wesabe sites may also store information, known as
              cookies, in your browser.  These pieces of technical information are used
              to make the site more secure and easier to use, to monitor and
              troubleshoot performance and reliability issues, and to judge the
              effectiveness of individual features and marketing campaigns.  This
              technical information is not directly correlated with the personal
              information of individual users.</li>

                      <li><strong>Information about children:</strong> We do not and will not
              knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under
              the age of 13.  Any person who provides their personal information to
              Wesabe through this website represents that they are 13 years of age or
              older. (This is consistent with the federal Children’s Online
              Privacy Protection Act of 1998.)</li>

                      <li><strong>Other websites:</strong> This privacy policy applies to
              websites and services that are owned and operated by Wesabe, Inc.  We
              do not have any control over the websites of third parties that may
              be linked to from pages on our website, and we cannot be responsible
              for the actions or policies of such third parties.  We encourage you
              to check the applicable privacy policy of these sites before entering
              information on them.</li>

            <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Customized content:</strong> We may use personal information
              to provide the services you’ve requested, including services that
              display customized content.</li>

              <li><strong>Decision support:</strong> We may use aggregate and
              non-personally identifiable data to provide the broader Wesabe community
              with information to make better decisions.</li>

              <li><strong>Keeping in touch:</strong> We may use your personal information
              to contact you under various circumstances, such as in response to support
              requests, or to deliver newsletters or alerts that you have requested.  You
              may opt out of any or all of these communications if you so choose.</li>

              <li><strong>Third parties:</strong> We may share non-personally
              identifiable aggregate data with third parties outside of Wesabe.  We may
              also share personal information with third parties in limited
              circumstances, including when complying with legal process, preventing
              fraud or imminent harm, and ensuring the security of our network and
              services. When we use third parties to assist us in processing your
              personal information, we require that they strictly comply with our
              Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security
              measures. </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="indent1">
            <h3>How We Protect Your Information</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Privacy wall:</strong> The data that you submit to Wesabe is
              divided into two categories: public and private. Public data is
              associated with your public persona (i.e., publicly posted information
              and some forms of optional account information such as public name and
              user image). Your private data, which includes your bank account and
              transaction information, is only connected to your public persona by your
              password, which we never store. Therefore, your private data can only be
              connected to your user account when you are logged in; when you log out
              of Wesabe, the connection is completely severed and your privacy
              protected.</li>

              <li><strong>Anonymization and encryption:</strong> Where feasible,
              the data that you send to Wesabe is scrubbed of sensitive information
              (such as account numbers) before processing.  When we must store and
              process sensitive data in order to provide the service, we make extensive
              efforts to protect that information from unauthorized access, disclosure,
              alteration, and destruction.  These steps include the use of firewalls,
              network-layer encryption such as SSL, storage-layer encryption, and
              dedicated monitoring systems.</li>

              <li><strong>No guarantee:</strong> No data transmissions over the Internet
              can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  We cannot ensure or warrant the
              security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own
              risk.  Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to
              ensure security on our systems.  However, please note that this is not a
              guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered
              or destroyed.</li>

              <li><strong>Notification:</strong> If Wesabe learns of a security systems
              breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take
              appropriate protective steps.  By using this website or providing
              personal information to us you agree that we can communicate with you
              electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues
              relating to your use of this website.  Wesabe may post a notice on our
              website if a security breach occurs.  Wesabe may also send an email to
              you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances.
              Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice
              of a security breach in writing.  To receive free written notice of a
              security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic
              notice) you should notify us at
              <a href="support@wesabe.com">support@wesabe.com</a>. </li>
