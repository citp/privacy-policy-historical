# Wesabe

This notice provides the Wesabe privacy policy, which describes the privacy practices that apply to Wesabe's web service worldwide ("the service"). Additionally you can check our [data bill of rights](https://web.archive.org/page/security) — our commitment to our users' privacy.

## Collected data and personal information

  * **Personally identifiable data:** Wesabe collects an email address when you register for the service, and all other information is completely voluntary. We recommend the use of anonymous email accounts for users who want to increase their anonymity.
  * **Privacy wall:** The data that you submit to Wesabe is divided into two categories: public and private. Public data is associated with your public persona (i.e., your public user name and user photo, if you have provided one) and consists of tips, goals, comments, and other data visible by other users. Your private data, which consists of your bank accounts and transactions, is only connected to your public persona by your password, which is not stored by Wesabe. Therefore, your private data can only be connected to your user account when you are logged in; when you log out of Wesabe, the connection is completely severed and your privacy protected.
  * The Wesabe service is predicated on users contributing aggregate non-personally identifiable financial data.
  * Wesabe members may, as an option, contribute information in the form of tips, goals, and comments.
  * Wesabe uses cookies to make the site easier to use. We do not share our cookies with any other site, nor do we use cookies to track your behavior on other sites.



## Uses

  * We may use personal information to provide the services you've requested, including services that display customized content.
  * We use aggregate and non-personally identifiable data to provide the broader Wesabe community with information to make better decisions.
  * We may share aggregate data with third parties outside of Wesabe.
  * When we use third parties to assist us in processing your personal information, we require that they strictly comply with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
  * We may also share information with third parties in limited circumstances, including when complying with legal process, preventing fraud or imminent harm, and ensuring the security of our network and services.



## Your options

  * We offer you choices when we ask for personal information, whenever reasonably possible.
  * We have created tools that allow you to participate in the Wesabe so you can control the amount of personally identifiable information is released.
  * You may decline to provide personal information to us and/or refuse cookies in your browser, although some of our features or services may not function properly as a result.
  * We allow you to delete your data because it is your data and you own and control it.
