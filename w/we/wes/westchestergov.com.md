Westchester County does not knowingly collect personal information from children or create profiles of children through this Web site.

During your visit to this Web site you may initiate a transaction such as submission of an application for a Civil Service exam or the filing of a court record. The information, including personal information, volunteered by you in initiating the transaction is used to operate various Westchester County departmental programs, which include the provision of goods, services, and information. The information collected by our departments may be disclosed for those purposes that may be reasonably ascertained from the nature and terms of the transaction in connection with which the information was submitted.
