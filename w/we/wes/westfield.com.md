## HOW INFORMATION IS USED

See the _["Choice"](https://www.westfield.com/privacy#choices)_ section below on how to change your communications preferences.


  * **Advertising.** Westfield uses the information you provide us to help us tailor and show advertisements to you. We may partner with third parties to help us display relevant advertising and to manage our advertising across multiple channels.

You may opt out of some interest-based cookie advertising by clicking "Cookie Settings" and for more information about third-party advertisers and your ability to opt-out of targeted advertising from such third-parties please visit the Network Advertising Initiative (<http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (<http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>).

## YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

  * **Shine The Light Law** \- California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits California residents to request and obtain from Westfield once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to:



ATTN: Privacy Counsel

Please be aware that not all information sharing is covered by the "Shine the Light" requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.

  * **How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals for California Residents** : California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how Westfield responds to "Do Not Track" browser settings. Westfield does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.



## HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION

  * **Service Providers.** We may share information we collect about you with third parties who provide services on our behalf to help with our business activities, for example:


    * processing credit cards and payments;
    * hosting, managing and/or servicing our data;
    * distributing emails;
    * providing advertising, analytics, and research; and 
    * managing brand and product promotions and administering and marketing services and features.   


  * **Disclosure for Legal Reasons.** We may disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or comply with the law, including valid legal requests from private parties, law enforcement, or other government agencies (e.g., subpoena, summons, or court order).


  * **Change of Ownership.** If Westfield is involved in a merger, acquisition, dissolution, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, we reserve the right to transfer your personal information. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership.



## YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES

We enable you to maintain control of your privacy by providing choices about what information you provide us and how we communicate with you, and by providing access to your personal information.

  * **Choice:** You have choices about what information you provide Westfield. Where information is required, it will be marked as such. If the information input fields are not marked as required, providing the information is optional. Note that failing to provide some of the requested information may limit your use of our products or services. 



You may adjust your communication preferences or opt out of communications at any time by clicking "unsubscribe" at the bottom of the email, following instructions provided in the communication, or changing your preferences within your Westfield account. If you are having difficulty updating your communication preferences, _[contact us](mailto:unsubscribe@westfield.com)_.

  * **Access.** You may access, correct, or delete your personal information by logging into your Westfield account and following the relevant prompts, or by _[contacting us](mailto:unsubscribe@westfield.com)_.



We will endeavor to provide you with access to your personal information wherever possible. Note that in some cases we may not be able to provide you access, such as where providing access would be unreasonably difficult or would compromise the privacy of others.

## EUROPEAN PRIVACY RIGHTS

  * Westfield Europe Limited is the ‘data controller’ for the personal data we collect. It is registered with the Information Commissioner’s Office with registration number Z5539526.
  * You have the right to request access to, to update and delete your personal data (see "Access").

## INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF EUROPEAN PERSONAL INFORMATION

By agreeing to this User Privacy Notice, you consent to the transfer of your personal information outside of the European Economic Area.

Westfield Europe Limited transfers information overseas in the following situations:

**To other members of the Westfield Corporation Group where we share computing systems:** These transfers are made lawful through an agreement between our group companies that use model contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.

**Where suppliers are either based outside of the United Kingdom or store personal data on servers outside of the United Kingdom:** Where these transfers are outside of the European Economic Area or where a country is not deemed to have an equivalent level of data protection law to the United Kingdom we typically use model contractual clauses to legitimize these transfers. 

## CHILDREN

Westfield does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use Wi-Fi networks in Westfield centers.

If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to Westfield, please _[contact us](mailto:privacy@westfield.com)_ and we will delete that information from our databases.

## HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

Westfield retains the information we collect for as long as necessary to provide the products and services you have requested, or for other essential purposes such as complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.  If you have any questions about the retention of your information, please contact us directly at [privacy@westfield.com](mailto:privacy@westfield.com).

## HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

The security of your personal information is important to us. While we follow generally accepted security standards to safeguard the information submitted to us, it is not possible to guarantee the security or integrity of information. Therefore, we encourage you to take precautions to protect your information, including protecting your passwords, using secure networks to access the Internet, and logging out of online services when you are away from your device.
