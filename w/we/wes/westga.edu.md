### Lawful Basis for Collecting and Processing of Personal Data

The University of West Georgia is an institute of higher education involved in education, research, and community development. In order for UWG to educate its students both in class and on-line, engage in world-class research, and provide community services, it is essential and necessary to collect, process, use, and maintain data of its students, employees, applicants, research subjects, and others involved in its educational, research, and community programs. The lawful bases for collection and use of this data includes, without limitation, admission, registration, delivery of classroom, on-line, and study abroad education, grades, communications, employment, applied research, development, program analysis for improvements, and records retention. Examples of data that UWG may need to collect in connection with the lawful bases are: name, email address, IP address, physical address or other location identifier, photos, as well as some sensitive personal data obtained with prior consent. 

Most of UWG’s collection and processing of personal data will fall under the following categories: 

  1. Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by UWG or third parties in providing education, employment, research and development, community programs. 
  2. Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract. This lawful basis pertains primarily but not exclusively to research contracts. 
  3. Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which UWG is subject. This lawful basis pertains primarily but not exclusively to compliance with state and federal laws. Examples are providing enrollment data to the US Department of Education and providing employment and payroll data as required by the US Internal Revenue Service. 
  4. The data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes. This lawful basis pertains primarily but not exclusively to the protection of research subjects, providing medical and mental health services. 



There will be some instances where the collection and processing of personal data will be pursuant to other lawful bases. 

### Types of Personal Data Collected and Why

The University of West Georgia collects a variety of personal and sensitive data to meet one of its lawful bases, as referenced above. Most often the data is used for academic admissions, enrollment, educational programs, job hiring, provision of medical services, participation in research, development and community outreach. Data typically includes name, address, transcripts, work history, information for payroll, research subject information, medical and health information (for student health services, or travel), and donations. 

If a data subject refuses to provide personal data that is required by UWG in connection with one of its lawful bases to collect such personal data, such refusal may make it impossible for UWG to provide education, employment, research or other requested services. 

### Where the University of West Georgia gets Personal and Sensitive Personal Data
