This includes contact information posted in your profile, photos you upload, emails sent to other Butter Buddies members, comments posted on your “wall” or others’ walls, etc. You also have the ability within your account to adjust your privacy settings to restrict access to all or parts of your profile to site members only, or only those connected to you as “friends.”

**Commenting on Articles and Blog Posts:** All website visitors may leave comments at the ends of articles or blog posts, but you must provide your name and a valid email address. Comments are reviewed for relevancy and tone (irrelevant posts or those with vulgarity/obscenity, libel, etc. will not be posted).

**For futher information:** Please [contact us](http://www.westonaprice.org/contact-us/ "Contact Us") if you have any questions or concerns about the privacy of your information.
