Westnet may disclose some of your personal information that we hold to organisations located outside Australia in countries which do not have the same or substantially similar privacy laws, but only to the extent necessary to provide you with telecommunications services requested by you or to meet our business needs. We may also store your information in cloud or other types of networked or electronic storage. Where required, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that these overseas organisations do not breach the Australian Privacy Principles.

We have listed below the known countries in which the overseas organisations with which we share your personal information are located.

  * Canada
  * Europe
  * Japan
  * Malaysia
  * New Zealand
  * Singapore
  * The Philippines
  * United Kingdom

It is not always practicable to know in which country your information may be held, for example, when your personal information is stored in cloud. In these types of circumstances, disclosures may occur in countries other than those listed above.

Overseas organisations will be subject to their own laws and may be required to disclose information that we share with them. In those instances, we will not be responsible for that disclosure.
