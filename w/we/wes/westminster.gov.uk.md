# Web Site Privacy Policy

WESTMINSTER CITY COUNCIL will use its best endeavours to safeguard the privacy of its website visitors. This policy explains the website data processing practices of WESTMINSTER CITY COUNCIL.

#####   
What information do we collect?

We will collect personal details appropriate to the service you require. In some areas, this may simply mean registering your name, address and email details. Other on-line forms will require more information so that all the appropriate elements of your service request will be dealt with in a timely manner. 

#####   
What do we use personal information for?

There are various reasons that we need to collect personal data. For example, we may need to ask you for your contact details for correspondence purposes. Similarly, we may need information in order to fulfil our statutory obligations and regulatory responsibilities. Subject to your agreement we may contact you to either provide information about new services that are coming on line, or get your feedback on how well we are performing. In any event we will only ever obtain information from you that is ‘fit for purpose’ and does not constitute an invasion of your privacy. 

#####   
Allowing your details to be used across other council services

We are in the process of transforming our services in line with the Council’s One City Vision. All of this signals our commitment to significantly improve the quality of our Customers’ experience when they contact us. 

We are all frustrated on occasion when we have to repeat the same basic information about ourselves, such as name and contact details, each time we contact an organisation.

In recognition of this we are focussing on making it easier for people to do business with us, whenever and however they choose, and with the ability to be able to complete a range of different sorts of transactions with the Council, all through a single contact – i.e. a centralised customer database. You can [view a list of services currently using this facility](https://web.archive.org/councilgovernmentanddemocracy/dataprotectionandfreedomofinformation/joinedup.cfm).

Ultimately this will allow us to share basic customer details across the Council, thereby reducing the time you spend having to repeat these as you access new and existing services.

By agreeing to allow your details to be used across other council services, we will be able to capture this information when you first contact us and then re-use this information to minimise the time taken when you contact us in the future.

#####   
Rights

Please note that in agreeing to share these details you have not forfeited your rights as prescribed under the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Council will continue to apply the same level of care to safeguard your privacy and use of your information across all our services. Your service entitlement from the Council will not be affected should you decide not to allow your data to be shared in this way or you change your mind at any time in the future. For more information about how we process personal data please see our [Fair Processing Notice](https://web.archive.org/councilgovernmentanddemocracy/dataprotectionandfreedomofinformation/fairprocessing.cfm). 

#####   
Email Messages

We are keen to ensure that we are providing our citizens with services that they need. Consequently, you may receive occasional e-mail messages from WESTMINSTER CITY COUNCIL on matters that we consider may be of interest to you, if you have provided your email address to us for this purpose.
