We refer to each of these entities in this policy as "us", "we", or "Westfield".

### What personal information Westfield generally collects and why:

#### Customers

Westfield collects information from customers in a number of different ways. These include the following:

  * In connection with competitions or signing up to email or mobile newsletters, customers provide us with their contact details. Westfield collects these details to contact competition winners, and to inform customers about Westfield events, activities and promotions, both in centre and as part of Westfield's other activities. Customers have the option to opt out from receiving this information.
  * When customers hire mobility aids or other equipment from Westfield, or apply to use certain restricted spaces at Westfield managed centres, customers provide Westfield with certain information, including contact details. Westfield collects this information to ensure that there is a record of the hirer and to enable customers to be informed about upcoming Westfield events, activities and promotions, both in centre and as part of Westfield's other activities.
  * Westfield shopping centres and car parks are under video and camera surveillance. When entering Westfield shopping centres and car parks, customer's personal information and images may be collected by Westfield, and Westfield may collect customer's personal information and images from third parties (for example, the police or retailers). This information may be used by Westfield in connection with the management and security of the Westfield shopping centres and may be provided to law enforcement and government bodies, Westfield staff and subcontractors, insurers and retailers for those purposes. The licence plates of vehicles parked by customers in car parks may also be collected and used for the above purposes and also to assist customers to locate their cars including via online and mobile applications. This information is held securely and in a format which is access controlled, unless it is necessary to use this information for these purposes.
  * When customers use mobile applications developed by Westfield, or logon to WiFi provided in Westfield centres, customers provide Westfield with certain information including their contact details. Westfield collects this information to enable customers to be informed about upcoming Westfield events, activities and promotions, both in centre and as part of the Westfield's other activities, and sponsor and retailer promotions, and other activities which will be notified to customers as they sign in to use those facilities.
  * When customers purchase or redeem Westfield Gift Cards or are provided with Westfield Insurance Cards, they may provide Westfield with their contact details. These details are used for card fulfilment purposes and, if customers opt in, to contact customers about Westfield events, activities and promotions, both in centre and as part of the Westfield's other activities.
  * Where donations are made to Westfield Charity Limited or the Westfield Charities Fund by cheque, contact details of customers may be collected to verify the payer details or notify payers if the cheque is not able to be processed.



In addition to the purposes set out above, this information may be used by Westfield in connection with the management and security of the Westfield shopping centres generally, and may be provided to law enforcement and government bodies, insurers, Westfield staff and subcontractors, third parties who provide Westfield with services from time to time and retailers for these purposes.

Additionally, Westfield also conducts certain online activities through the Westfield websites, and associated sites managed by members of the Westfield Group. The collection of personal information through these activities and information associated with the Westfield websites is dealt with in the Westfield Online Privacy Policy, which can be found below.

Occasionally, the information may also be made available to others in connection with these activities, in order for those people to provide services to Westfield or as required by law, as well as to third parties in connection with any transactions involving the ownership of the centre.

If the retailer provides Westfield with direct debit or direct credit details, Westfield will only disclose those details to Westfield's bank to facilitate the provision of that service.
