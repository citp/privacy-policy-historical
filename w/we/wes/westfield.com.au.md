Customers have the option to opt out from receiving this information.
  * When customers hire mobility aids or other equipment from Scentre, or apply to use certain restricted spaces at Scentre managed centres, customers provide Scentre with certain information, including contact details. Scentre collects this information to ensure that there is a record of the hirer and to enable customers to be informed about upcoming events, activities and promotions, both in centre and as part of Scentre's other activities.
  * When customers attend Scentre-managed shopping centres and car parks under video and camera surveillance. When entering Westfield shopping centres and car parks, customers' personal information, car licence plate details and images may be collected by Scentre, and Scentre may also collect customers' personal information and images from third parties (for example, the police or retailers) in connection with the management and security of Scentre-managed shopping centres. This information may be used by Scentre in connection with the management and security of the Scentre shopping centres. This information may be provided to law enforcement and government bodies, Scentre staff and subcontractors, third parties who provide Scentre with services from time to time, insurers and retailers for those purposes. 
  * When customers park in Scentre-managed car parks with a ticketless parking system or car locator functionality, customers consent to provide us with their car licence plate details and, in some circumstances, other information including name, email address and telephone number. These details are used for measuring and analysing car parking dwell times and shopper behaviour in order to improve our centres, for the purposes of managing car parking at the centre, marketing purposes and also to assist customers to locate their cars including via online and mobile applications. 
  * When customers use mobile applications developed by Scentre, or logon to Wi-Fi provided in Westfield shopping centres or third party applications utilising Scentre’s infrastructure (including Bluetooth beacon networks), customers provide Scentre with certain information including their contact details. Scentre collects this information to enable customers to be informed about upcoming events, activities and promotions, both in centre and as part of Scentre's other activities, sponsor and retailer promotions, and other activities, which will be notified to customers as they sign in to use those facilities. 
  * When customers purchase, redeem or are provided with Westfield Gift Cards or Westfield Insurance Cards, they may provide Scentre with their contact details. These details are used for card fulfilment purposes and, if customers opt in, to contact customers about events, activities and promotions, both in centre and as part of the Scentre's other activities.
  * Where donations are made to Scentre Charity Limited as trustee for Westfield Charities Fund by cheque, contact details of customers may be collected to verify the payer details or notify payers if the cheque is not able to be processed.



In addition to the purposes set out above, this information may be used by Scentre in connection with the management and security of the Westfield shopping centres generally, to obtain feedback about a customer’s experiences at a centre (including with our retailers), and may be provided to law enforcement and government bodies, insurers, Scentre staff and subcontractors, third parties who provide Scentre with services from time to time and retailers for these purposes. 

Where you provide information to us in different ways, or we hold information about you Scentre may connect information provided to us for one purpose, with other information for use for one or more of the above purposes.

Additionally, Scentre also conducts certain online activities through the Scentre websites, and associated sites managed by members of the Scentre Group or their subcontractors. The collection of personal information through these activities and information associated with these websites is dealt with in the Scentre Online Privacy Policy, which can be found below.
