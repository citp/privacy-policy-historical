**MEMBER LIST SHARING POLICY**

CINCINNATI PUBLIC RADIO uses shared lists to maximize the benefits it can provide through other non-profit arts organizations and through qualified associations. If you are a member and allow it, your name and physical address may be exchanged for consideration with other local non-profit organizations for one-time mailing use only to promote a product or service that they offer. Such contacts from other local non-profits will only be made with CINCINNATI PUBLIC RADIO's consent, and CINCINNATI PUBLIC RADIO will only grant its consent when CINCINNATI PUBLIC RADIO considers the offer to be of potential interest to our members. Phone numbers, email addresses and giving histories are never shared.

CINCINNATI PUBLIC RADIO will not share, exchange, rent, or sell any of its lists to for-profit organizations, political parties or candidates for political office.

If you do not want your name and physical address to be used in this way, you may indicate this at the time you provide the information.
