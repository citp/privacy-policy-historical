**What types of user information do we collect and how?**

_Personally Identifiable Information_

When you access our Site, we may collect personally identifiable information (“PII”) from you when you voluntarily submit this information to us.  Examples of PII may include your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, user name, password and other information such as payment or credit card information.  We may supplement the information we receive from you with information about you that we receive from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, social media platforms and other third parties.

 _Other Information_

We may also collect other information when you access our Site.  “Other Information” is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an individual.  Other Information may include the type of device you are using, your IP address, the geographic location of your device (e.g., zip code or county), your operating system, the type of Internet browser that you use, usage information, diagnostic information and other data that allow us to improve our applications and serve you better, demographic information and other information provided by you, and aggregated information.  We collect this information through your browser or device, by means of cookies and pixel tags, using Adobe Flash technology (including Flash Local Shared Objects or “Flash LSOs”), from you or by aggregating information. We also may collect Other Information from you, such as your preferred means of communication, when you voluntarily provide this information. 

**What about "cookies"?**

Cookies are small bits of information that this Site places on your computer. We and our third party service providers use various types of cookies, local shared objects and pixel tags to identify your IP address, browser type, device characteristics, domain name, referring URLs and specific links and web pages through which you click. This data is collected automatically and utilized for site operations, fraud prevention and to help us improve this Site and your overall experience. This technology also allows us to recognize you when you return to this Site and to provide you with a customized experience that we feel will be of value to you.  Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you. 

Most web browsers allow you to exercise control over cookie files on your computer by erasing them, blocking them, or notifying you when such a file is stored. Please take a look at your particular browser for instructions on this function.  You may also wish to refer to <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html>.  If you do elect to disable cookies, please note that you may not be able to take full advantage of a personalized experience on this Site and certain functions may not be available to you. 

WDC uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies and similar technologies to analyze how users use the Domains. The information generated about Domain usage (including your shortened IP address) is transmitted to Google in the U.S. This information is used to evaluate visitors’ use of the Domain, compile statistical reports on Domain activity, and provide other services related to the Site and internet use. Google may also collect information about Domain visitors’ use of other websites. For more information about Google Analytics, or to opt out of Google Analytics, please go to: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

We may also use Flash Cookies, LSOs and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Site, fraud prevention and other site operations.  If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).  Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the Site or our online content. 

**How do we use PII?**

We may use PII: 

  * To process and respond to your requests;

  * To our third party service providers who provide services such as website hosting, data analysis, payment processing, order fulfillment, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service, email delivery, credit card processing, auditing and other similar services.  We seek to require that our service providers adhere to appropriate restrictions on access and use of your PII.

  * In the event of a merger, reorganization, acquisition, joint venture, assignment, spin-off, transfer or sale or disposition of all or any portion of our business, including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings.



**How do we use and disclose Other Information?**

We may use and disclose Other Information in any manner for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.  If we are required to treat Other Information as PII under applicable law, then we may use it for all the purposes for which we use and disclose PII.  If we combine Other Information with PII, we will treat the combined information as PII while it is combined.

**Interest-Based Ads and Online Tracking**

We may partner with third-party service providers to serve ads regarding goods or services that may be of interest to you when you access and use the Site and third party-sites.  Some of the ads on this Site or on third party sites may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on what we or the online advertising network serving the ad know about you or your computer's browsing activity on both the Site and third-party sites.  To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (including through the use of pixel tags). 

The Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about internet advertising companies, including information about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by their members. See [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) for general information about the NAI and <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp> for the opt-out page.  You may also visit <http://www.aboutads.info/consumers/> to learn about interest-based advertising and how to opt-out from ads served by some or all participating companies.   ****

These opt-out mechanisms rely on cookies to remember your choices.   If you delete your cookies, use another computer or device, or change browsers, you will need to repeat this process.  In addition, opting out of interest-based ads will not opt you out of all ads, but rather only those ads that are personalized to your interests. 

**Third Party Services**

This Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site or service to which the Site links.  The inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply our or our affiliates’ endorsement of the linked site or service. 

Please note that we are not responsible for the collection, usage and disclosure policies and practices (including the data security practices) of other organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, RIM or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider or device manufacturer, including any PII you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with our Social Media Pages.  ****

**How can I access or correct my information?**

If you would like us to correct or delete PII that you have provided to us in connection with your use of this Site, please contact us at [privacy@wdc.com](mailto:privacy@wdc.com), and we will endeavor to respond in a reasonable time.  We will make a good faith effort to provide you with access to your PII and to correct any inaccuracy or delete such information, at your request, if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.  There may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed.  We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical or for which access is not otherwise required.  For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the PII associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request.

**How do we protect your information?**

We have implemented reasonable security measures and practices in an effort to protect the confidentiality of your PII.  However, no security system is impenetrable.  It may be possible for third parties to intercept or access information that you provide to WDC.  WDC cannot guarantee the security of your information, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to WDC.  It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password(s), computer and WDC Products.  If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting use in accordance with the “How to Contact Us” section below.

**Children**

We do not knowingly solicit data from, or market to, children under the age of 13.  If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personal information, he or she should contact us at[ privacy@wdc.com](mailto:%20privacy@wdc.com).  We will take reasonable steps to delete such information from our database within a reasonable time.  ****

**Your California Privacy Rights**

California law permits our established customers who are California residents to request information regarding the manner in which WDC shares certain categories of your PII with third parties, for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  California law provides that you have the right to submit a request to WDC at its designated address and receive the following information.

**Cross-Border Transfers**

The Site is controlled and operated by us from the United States and is not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States.  Your PII may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers.  By using the Site, you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have different data protection rules than your country. 

**Retention Period**

We will retain your PII for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
