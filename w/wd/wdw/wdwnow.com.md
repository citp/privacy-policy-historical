DisneyNow Policies:

1\. What Identifiable Information do we collect?

We collect information for the purpose of determining how many visitors visit DisneyNow.com. This information also lets us know if you're a returning visitor (meaning you liked DisneyNow.com enough to come back a second or third time). We do know the IP address of your Internet Service Provider, we also know what type of Browser you're using so that we can better design areas of our site which might be more user-friendly with your Browser. We also know the date and time you visited our site and if you happened to find us through a referring link, we know what referring link helped you find your way to DisneyNow.com. However, the only time we actually know who you are is when you provide such information by entering reservation request forms, survey forms, sign-up for newsletters or enter contests.

2\. Who collects the information and where on earth is it stored?

Good question! DisneyNow.com maintains all information at its secure corporate headquarters located at Room Finders Inc.., 125-127 Flagship Drive, Lutz, Florida 33549.

3\. How is the information used: 

DisneyNow.com never shares, sells or trades personal information to any third party for any reason whatsoever! DisneyNow.com only uses personal information in order to process your information requests. If at any time you sign up for our DisneyNow.com Newsletter, you will be asked to opt-in, which means you can opt-out as well. If you receive an email from DisneyNow.com, you received the email due to a request for information which originated from you! In other words, we won't contact you, unless you contact us or sign-up for a Newsletter, Contest or Survey!

4\. Exceptions to the rules:

DisneyNow.com may offer chat rooms, message boards or other means of communicating with DisneyNow.com or other online users. In this case, be advised that if you post your name or other identifiable information within a public forum found on DisneyNow.com, you may receive offers or emails from other users. The best way to guard against this problem is to not post your email address unless you're really sure you want to receive unsolicited email.

In addition, if you participate within a chat or message board forum, enter a screen name as opposed to your real name.
