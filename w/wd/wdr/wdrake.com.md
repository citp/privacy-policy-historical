Who are we?

Walter Drake, a pioneer in direct mail, began operations in 1947 in Colorado Springs with a single novel idea. In his one-room office, he created a character named “Tommy Turtle” and parents all over the country signed up for their children to receive personalized, upbeat pen pal letters and gifts from Tommy. In the beginning, he advertised in House Beautiful and Harper’s Bazaar magazines. After achieving success in this endeavor, Mr. Drake gradually added more and more products including stationery and address labels for writing letters to family and friends which became very popular during the 1950’s and 60’s as America became a more mobile society.

Today, the business Walter Drake started more than a half century ago, is a leading direct marketer of kitchenware, household products, organizers, personal health care items, gardening and outdoor décor, personalized gifts, calendars and stationery. The extensive line of products offered provide unique problem solvers and specialized items for all ages to enjoy.

Christmas cards -- the spin-off idea that evolved from address labels and stationery are still designed exclusively for the catalog, along with exclusive stationery items including calendars, address labels and family organizers.

Personalization continues to be a benchmark of the company. Techniques such as hand painting, printing, embroidery, engraving and foil stamping highlight personalized products. For a great selection of unique timesaving products and gifts.

With operations in Wisconsin and customers from all over, Walter Drake is still providing unique products and values expected from a long-time company. Along with the website, the business now consists of several catalog brands: Walter Drake, Christmas Cards by Walter Drake, and The Best of Walter Drake.

What is the Walter Drake Environmental Policy?

Did you know?

* Walter Drake Company has invested $150,000 in lighting upgrades at the distribution center that has resulted in the annual electricity savings of 1,100,000 kilowatt hours. This is the equivalent of providing electricity to 100 homes or the energy of 1990 barrels of oil. The impact of this project is reducing our carbon footprint by 2,522,920lbs of CO2 annually. [Click here for more detail](https://web.archive.org/web/20130310042441id_/http%3A//www.wdrake.com/walterdrake/images/docs/Copy%20of%20Environmental%20Emissions%20Equivalents.xls).  
* Walter Drake Company uses corrugate shipping containers made from over 60% post consumer content.  
* Walter Drake Company is committed to recycling. Annually, our distribution center recycles 600 tons of cardboard and 60 tons of office paper.  
* From 2005 to 2007 our use of lighter weight paper has reduced our total wood use by 1,472 tons, or 10,191 trees. The energy saved was 21,806 million BTU’s, enough to power 240 homes each year. Greenhouse gases were reduced the equivalent of 4,364,582 lbs CO2, or the emissions from 396 cars per year. Wastewater was reduced 10,219,474 gallons.

Please allow 24 hours turn-around time for an email response. 

Can I place an order online and send you a check?

We do not offer that kind of payment option. However, you may download a [printable order form](https://web.archive.org/web/20130310042441id_/http%3A//www.wdrake.com/walterdrake/images/docs/OrderForm.pdf) from the website and mail it in with a check. 

Do I have to pay sales tax?

Walter Drake collects the applicable sales tax on all orders shipped to Wisconsin.

 **Colorado and Oklahoma Sales Tax**

We do not collect sales or use taxes in all states. For states imposing sales or use taxes, your purchase is subject to use tax unless it is specifically exempt from taxation. Your purchase is not exempt merely because it is made over the Internet or by other remote means. Many states require purchasers to file a sales/use tax return at the end of the year reporting all of the taxable purchases that were not taxed and to pay tax on those purchases. Details of how to file these returns may be found at the websites of your respective taxing authorities.

For Oklahoma purchasers, the tax may be reported and paid on the Oklahoma individual income tax return [Form 511] or by filing a consumer use tax return [Form 21-1]. The referenced forms and corresponding instructions are available on the Oklahoma Tax Commission website, www.tax.ok.gov.

We may be required by Colorado law to provide purchasers an end-of-year summary of Colorado purchases in order to assist purchasers in filing their tax returns. We also may be required by law to provide the Colorado Department of Revenue with a report of the total amount of all your purchases at the end of the year. We will not provide any transactional details to the Department other than the total amount of your purchases.

Some customers have asked why these new requirements exist. We are required to provide the notice and the reports described above for Colorado purchases based on a Colorado law (HB 1193) enacted in February 2010. We are required to provide the notice (but not the reports) above for Oklahoma purchases based on an Oklahoma law (HB 2359) enacted in June 2010. 

Do I have to register to place an order?

No, but you may register to start an online account with your own unique password during the checkout process. You may use this password to check on the status of your order. You may feel free to create an online account by clicking this link: [My Account](https://web.archive.org/web/20130310042441id_/http%3A//www.wdrake.com/walterdrake/myaccount/default.aspx). Please keep in mind that you will not be able to check your order history or the status of your order if you are not logged into your account at the time you submit an order. 

How do I check the status of my web order?

You may check the status of your order online, provided you have previously created an account. To check on the status of your order, log in to your account and click on the Order Status link. 

How do I track an Order's Status?

How can I find more about my previous Orders?

You can check your order history at any time by logging into your account and clicking on the "Order History" link. 

I forgot my password. What do I do?

What should I expect to happen once I place an online order?

Once you submit your order, we will email you twice, confirming that we have received your order. The initial confirmation does not contain any details, but lets you know we have received your order. You will then receive a more detailed confirmation within minutes of ordering. We will also email a shipping confirmation when your order has been shipped from our fulfillment center.

How does Installment Billing work?

Installment billing is available for credit card orders only and is subject to approval. (Debit cards may be used however charges will be preauthorized and funds will be reserved in your account prior to billing.) Merchandise total must exceed $75 after discounts, promotions, and gift certificates have been applied to your order. Your merchandise total will be divided into equal payments. The first payment will also include shipping & handling fees and sales tax and will be charged to your credit card on the date we ship your order. The balance due will be divided into equal monthly payments each commencing 30 days from the date of your previous payment. We will automatically charge your credit card until full payment is received. In the case of split shipments, drop shipments, or backorders your payments may be split based on when your items ship. There is no interest charged by Walter Drake for installment billing. Normal interest charges may be applied by your credit card company per your individual card agreement. If unable to obtain credit card authorization at the time of billing, you authorize Walter Drake to charge up to the full unpaid balance to another credit card we have on file. Installment Billing only available on select offers.
