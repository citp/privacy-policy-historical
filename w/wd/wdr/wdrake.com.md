**What information do we collect?**  
Whenever you shop with Walter Drake, online or through our catalogs, we collect the information necessary to process your transaction. This may include item, quantity ordered, name, address, city, state, zip code, telephone number, e-mail address, and billing information (credit card or check account number, expiration date and billing address). When orders are shipped to an address different from the billing address, we will also ask for the name(s), full address(es) and phone number(s) of order recipients. Information you enter is collected even if you cancel or do not complete an order. 

In addition when you visit online, our server automatically recognizes the address of your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and, in some cases, your domain name. We cannot identify you individually from your screen name if you are using America Online or one of the other major online services. Our server also identifies your browser, your browser version, the operating system you are using, the pages you visit in The Walter Drake Store and the uniform resource locator (URL) of where you were on the Internet if you clicked a link to www.wdrake.com.

We intend to continue improving the content and function of the Walter Drake Online Store. For this reason, we gather the information mentioned above so that we can provide content of interest to you and a site that functions correctly on your computer system. 

In the event of a merger, consolidation, or sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets or business of wdrake.com (a "Successor"), one of the assets which would generally be transferred is the information we collect from our customers.

We may disclose any information you provide to wdrake.com(i) when we believe disclosure to be appropriate to comply with any law, regulation, or governmental request, or to comply with judicial process; or (ii) if such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate this web site or to process any purchases you make or conduct any promotions you participate in; (iii) to protect the rights or property of wdrake.com, its users, Sponsors, Providers, Licensors, or Merchants.
