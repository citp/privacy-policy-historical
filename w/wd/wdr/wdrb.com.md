We may use various tracking technologies, whether now in existence or hereafter created, to store and collect usage information. Tracking technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your device. Tracking technologies include:

(1)                **Cookies**. A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer or your web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide convenience and other features to you. You may block, limit, or delete the storage of browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser or other software, or deleting the cookies manually from your device. However, if you block and/or delete cookies, some portions of our Services may not function properly or be available to you. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will block cookies, our systems will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Services.

(2)                **Preference Based Advertising:  **We may work with third parties, including advertising companies and website analysis firms, who use cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information when you visit our Website, use our Apps, or visit third-party sites. This non-personally identifiable information, collected through cookies and web beacons, is typically used by these third-party advertising companies (i.e., advertising networks) to serve you with advertisements while on third-party sites that are tailored to your preferences and needs. If you do not wish to participate in this activity, go to [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/) and follow the simple opt-out process provided at that link. 

A couple of important notes about this opt-out tool: (1) it includes all the advertising networks that we may work with, but also many that we do not work with; and (2) it may rely on cookies to ensure that a given advertising network does not collect information about you (“ **Opt-out Cookies** ”) – an explanation of how Opt-out Cookies work can be found on [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/). Therefore, if you use a different device, change web browsers or delete these Opt-out Cookies from your computer, you will need to perform the opt-out task again. In addition, third-party mobile applications, such as AppChoices (offered by the Digital Advertising Alliance), may allow you to opt out of preference-based advertising via your device. ** **

(3)                **Do Not Track Features** : Certain internet browsers may offer you the option of providing notice to websites that you do not wish for your online activities to be tracked for preference-based advertising purposes (“ **DNT Notice** ”). Some browsers are, by default, set to provide a DNT Notice, whether that reflects your preference. Please note that with respect to our Website, we do not take any action based on browser based DNT Notices. If you do not wish to participate in preference-based advertising activities, you should follow the simple opt-out process identified above.  ** **

There may be other tracking technologies now or later developed that we use in connection with the Services.

We may make this information available on or through the Services and to our users. You may be able to restrict what information is shared and how it is used through privacy and other settings.
