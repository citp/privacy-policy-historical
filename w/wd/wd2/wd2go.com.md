# Privacy Policy

  
Corporate Information  
---  
Privacy Policy  
  
Western Digital Corporation ("we" or "us") is committed to protecting the privacy of customers, especially those who access and use our Web site located at URL [www.wdc.com](http://www.wdc.com/) or URL [www.westerndigital.com](http://www.westerndigital.com/) (the "Site").

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") is designed to inform you about the types of information that we gather about you and your organization, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of that information. **This Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.**

1\. What information do we collect from you?

Our Site collects two types of information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with efficient and effective service while using our Site.

Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that specifically identifies who you are. We request Personally Identifiable Information when you order a product or service, register a product, fill out surveys, create a user account for the WD Community or correspond with us. This information might include your name, mailing address, telephone number or e-mail address. This might also include your credit card number and card security code (also called CVV) and the expiration date, if you create a return materials authorization (RMA), purchase an extended warranty or purchase products through WD’s customer loyalty program. We transmit your entire credit card information to the appropriate credit card company in an encrypted format during order processing for payment processing. If you purchase products through the WD on-line store, please note that the on-line store's privacy policy may differ from this privacy policy.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather this information each time you access our Site. This information, compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis, may include the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the web site you visited just prior to accessing our Site, the URL you go to after leaving our Site, what browser you are using, platform type, your internet service provider, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the Site, track a user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. You do not have to register with us before we can collect this anonymous information. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. 

Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.

The Site may contain “cookies.” Cookies are bits of electronic information generated by web servers and stored on your hard drive when you visit practically any website on the Internet. Cookies are often used to differentiate users, store user preferences and track user trends in general. We may use cookies to improve the quality of the Site and to better understand how users interact with the Site. We do not use cookies to retrieve individual personally identifying information about you from your computer unless you knowingly and willingly provide such information. You can adjust your web browser security settings to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web browser, some features of the Site we offer may not function properly.

**2\. How do we use the information that we receive from you?**

Our primary goal in collecting personal information from our customers and other visitors to our Site is to provide those customers and visitors with a superior customized online experience. We use customer contact information to provide faster, more effective warranty service, to contact prior purchasers and inform them of the status of their online orders or returns, to send promotional e-mails about products and services that may be of interest to them, and to contact users in relation to their user accounts and use of the WD Community. 

We may also perform statistical analyses of aggregate customer behavior. For instance, we may analyze which pages on our Site receive the most visitors or how long visitors spend reviewing those pages when visiting the Site. This allows us to measure relative customer interest in the various areas of our Site. We then use that information to improve the content of our Site, to enhance your experience when visiting the Site, to customize the content and/or layout of the Site's pages, to provide the services required by our individual customers, to comply with any requirements of law; to serve, or have a third party serve specialized or relevant advertising content and/or recommendations to you on the Site; and for our internal purposes. We may from time to time supply the owners or operators of third party sites from which it is possible to link to the Site with information relating to the number of users linking to the Site from their sites. You cannot be identified from this information.

**3\. With whom do we share your information?**

Except in the situations described in the following paragraph, we do not share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties. You should also consult the privacy policy of our on-line store, which is managed by one of the firms with whom we do business. The on-line store's privacy policy may differ from this privacy policy.

From time to time, we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to appropriate governmental authorities or other third parties in conjunction with a judicial, administrative or other proceeding. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a valid court order or subpoena or in order to assist a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our Site's services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.

**4\. Children’s Privacy**

The Site complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and all other applicable laws and regulations protecting children’s privacy on the Internet. The Site is not directed to children under the age of 18 and we do not allow persons under 18 years of age to create user accounts. Therefore, except as may be required by law, the Site does not knowingly collect, maintain, or disclose any personal information from children under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not: (i) access or use the Site, (ii) create or attempt to create an account on the Site, (iii) sign up for any subscription service, or (iv) buy anything through the Site.

As a parent or guardian you can request that WD remove personal information of your child that was submitted without your consent or by the child misrepresenting his or her age. At your request, we will take reasonable steps to remove such information from our database. All such requests should include the same user name, password, and e-mail address that your child submitted and should be sent to [webinfo@wdc.com](mailto:webinfo@wdc.com).

**5\. Privacy Policy changes.**

This Privacy Policy was last changed on November 24, 2009. If we make changes to any terms or conditions of the Privacy Policy, the changes will be posted in this document so that you will always know what information we gather as well as how we might use that information and to whom we may disclose it. We may change, modify, add or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. Please be sure to check this page before proceeding to use our Site.
