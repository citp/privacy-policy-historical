If you disable LSOs, you won't have access to some features and some of our services will not function properly.

###  2\. USE OF INFORMATION

Main use of the non personally identifiable information is to continuously improve the Woisio Service. By looking at the statistics derived from the information we collected, we can see what is working, what is not and act on it.

The information is also used to verify your authority to access the Woisio Service, post content, write comments, vote, bid for / buy air times, upload / edit / delete / air content and to contact you when reasonably necessary. 

Woisio may also use any information you have provided as reasonably necessary to administer or provide customer support for the Woisio Service, and to provide you with periodic printed or e-mail communications about new products and services, discounts, special promotions or upcoming events.

Also, your full name and email address may be used when you use the Woisio Service to send a message or an invitation to another user. Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf of other friends on the site (such as when another user sends you a message or invites you to join a conversation).

Woisio and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone's past visits to Woisio website.

Woisio uses Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to better understand the demographic and interest breakdown of the Woisio visitors in order to add/remove relevant/irrelevant stages (channels) to Woisio Lineup, and improve the content alignment with existing stages (channels). Woisio also uses this insight to better align ads with stages (channels). 

If you would like to opt-out of receiving advertising like this from Google, or change any of the demographic or interest information about you; you can manage these settings by visiting the [Google Ads Settings](http://www.google.com/settings/ads/ "Google Ads Settings").

We may display interest-based ads to you when you are using Facebook through a tool offered by Facebook called the Custom Audience Tool. This tool allows us to personalize our ads based on your browsing experience with us. We do not share any of your personal information with Facebook. The tool lets Woisio convert your email address to a unique number that Facebook uses to match to unique numbers Facebook generates from email addresses of its users.
