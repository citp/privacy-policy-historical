 **Aggregate information:**

This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit our Website and what other sites may have directed you to us. This information, which is collected in a variety of different ways, is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Website’s Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) that points to the site you just came from, which URL you go to after visiting our Website, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address.

 **2\. How do we collect and use information?**

We do not collect any Personal Data about you through the Website unless you voluntarily provide it to us.

 **Service providers, agents and related third parties:**

We sometimes hire third parties to perform certain business-related functions.  When we employ a third party to perform a function of this nature, we may need to provide them with access to certain Personal Data. For example, in order to provide services to you, we may provide a limited amount of information about you to Full Contact, Inc. (“FullContact") so that FullContact can collect publicly available contact and social media information related to you such as email addresses, gender, company, job titles, photos, website URLs, social network handles and physical addresses.

 **Information collected with technology:**

Information collected by our servers.

Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.

This information is sent to us as aggregated information and is not traceable to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual.
