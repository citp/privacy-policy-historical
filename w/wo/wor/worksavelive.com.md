# Legal Disclaimers and Privacy Policy

## Disclosure

I maintain affiliate relationships with several companies. Most of these are programs that I have used and love. When I do not love the program, I say so. What this means is that when I write about a program or product I love and include a link, I get a commission, which helps support this site.

Sometimes a company compensates me (usually in the form of a gift card) to write a post about something I find interesting or useful. When that happens, I mention that I have been compensated at the end of the post. I do write about companies I am affiliated with, but my opinions are always truthful. I try to include the positives and negatives of any products I write about. If you have any questions about the above companies, feel free to contact me with any questions. I’d be glad to discuss them with you.

I also run paid ads in my sidebar. Some ads are affiliate ads for companies I love. I hand pick these ads, because they’re companies and products I personally use. All other ads like Google Adsense are random, and I do not endorse them.

## Policies

### Comment Policy

I enjoy comments, good discussion, and alternative viewpoints. You are always welcome to leave a comment if you have something to add to the conversation, a question to ask, or even a viewpoint different than my own. However, I do ask that you be respectful in voicing your opinions, both to me and to other commentators. I reserve the right to remove any comments that are obviously meant to be inflammatory or comments that are spam.

### Link Exchange Policy

I do not participate in link exchanges. I do not have time to respond to emails requesting link exchanges. I’m sorry.
