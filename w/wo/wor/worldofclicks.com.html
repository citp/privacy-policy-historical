                        <h1>Privacy</h1>

                        <h3>Our Commitment to Privacy</h3>

                        <p>Our Privacy Policy has been developed as an extension of our commitment to combine quality
                            products and services with integrity in dealing with users. The Policy is designed to assist you
                            in the understanding of how we collect, use and protect the personal information provided to
                            us.</p>

                        <h3>What Information Do We Collect?</h3>

                        <p>When you visit our site, we collect two types of information: personal information you actively
                            choose to disclose (“Active Information”) and Use</p>

                        <p>information collected, in a way not visible to you, on an aggregate anonymous basis as you and
                            other users browse our site (“Passive Information”).</p>

                        <h3>1. Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

                        <p>This refers to information that lets us know specifically about you i.e. profile information.</p>

                        <h3>A. Registration</h3>

                        <p>When you register to become an authorized reseller of our products or services, we will collect
                            Personally Identifiable Information (such as name, address, email address, and telephone
                            number). This Personally Identifiable Information is securely stored and may be accessed on our
                            website. You are assigned an identification number and select your own password – both are
                            needed to enter the Site and to access your Contact Information. Please safeguard your password
                            in a secure location as we are not responsible for breaches into the system when access is
                            willingly provided.</p>

                        <h3>B. Ordering</h3>

                        <p>When you place an order for products or services, we collect Personally Identifiable Information
                            (such as name, contact and billing information, credit card, and other transactional
                            information). We use this information to deliver your order, process payment, and to communicate
                            the status of your order.</p>

                        <h3>C. Credit Card Storage</h3>

                        <p>Credit card information collected at registration or for product orders is used only to process
                            payment for the transaction and, generally, is not retained on our Site. However, you may
                            voluntarily elect to securely store multiple credit cards to be used for product orders.</p>

                        <h3>D. Surveys and Promotions</h3>

                        <p>Occasionally, you may voluntarily provide Personally Identifiable Information to complete surveys
                            and questionnaires or to participate in user polls. We use this information to improve our
                            products and services and to ensure that we’re providing accurate disclosures. We may also use
                            your Personally Identifiable Information to provide you newsletters and other marketing
                            information that coincide with your preferences. You may customize your marketing preferences,
                            or let us know if you do not wish to receive any promotional materials, by adjusting your
                            Subscriptions &amp; Email options on the Site.</p>

                        <h3>2. Aggregate Information</h3>

                        <p>This refers to information that does not, by itself, identify you as a specific individual. Such
                            information would include the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website that referred you
                            to our Site, your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a number automatically assigned to your
                            computer whenever you surf the web), your operating system and browser type, and any search
                            terms that you enter on our Site. Our web server aggregates this information in order to monitor
                            the level of activity on our Site, evaluate its effectiveness, and improve the content or our
                            Site in order to make your visit an easy and enjoyable experience.We may collect, compile,
                            store, publish, promote, report, or otherwise disclose or use any Aggregate Information,
                            provided that such information does not personally identify you. We do not correlate any
                            Personally Identifiable Information with the Aggregate Information that we collect on our Site.
                            If we do correlate any Aggregate Information to you, it will be protected like any other
                            Personally Identifiable Information under this Privacy Statement.</p>

                        <h3>Active Information You Choose to Provide</h3>

                        <p>In order to gain use of the site (become a “user”), we require you to disclose the following

                        <h3> Passive Information Collected <br>
                            What is a Cookie? </h3>

                        <p>Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the computer
                            used to access a site. They are small pieces of data stored by a user’s browser to simplify
                            subsequent interactions with the site. This makes it easier for a user to move from site to site
                            and to complete transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience
                            easier and more personalized.Our site utilizes cookies to collect information about how our site
                            is used. Passive Information gathered may include the date and time of visits, the site pages
                            viewed, time spent at our site, the sites visited just before and just after visiting our site.

                            function in your web browser.Our site’s servers also automatically identify your computer by its
                            Internet Protocol address, which is a unique string of numbers that are assigned to your
                            computer by your Internet Service Provider. The IP address may be used to address problems with
                            our server or to gather broad demographic information about our users. We passively collect your
                            IP Address.</p>

                        <h3>How Do We Use the Information Collected?</h3>

                        <p>Broadly speaking, persons we employ directly, or as contractors or agents at our direction use
                            Active Information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing customer
                            support and making available other products or services we think might be of interest to our
                            users. We may use the Active Information or Passive Information you provide to contact you about
                            various changes to our site, new services, features or products we offer. If at any time you do
                            not wish to receive such information, you may “opt-out” of doing so by adjusting your email
                            settings in the back office of the website.We use Passive Information to gather information
                            about our users and to enhance our site to make it easier, faster and friendlier for users.
                            Additionally, cookies help us better understand the usage pattern of the people that visit our
                            site, which helps us improve our services. Passive Information may result in your viewing of

                            are subjecting yourself to their privacy policies and data collection. Please read the privacy

                            assets of our company, another company may need to review our company’s assets, which might
                            include your information, to make business decisions as to whether to acquire such assets.</p>
