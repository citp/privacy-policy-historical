# WordStream Privacy Policy

Last Updated: August 9, 2018

Our privacy policy tells you what personal data (PD) and non-personal data (NPD) WordStream may collect from you, how we collect it, how we protect it, how we may share it, and how you can access, change, or delete it. Our privacy policy also explains certain legal rights that you have with respect to your personal data. If at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights described below, please write to us by email at privacy@wordstream.com or by mail to WordStream, Inc., 101 Huntington Ave., 7th Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA, Attn: Privacy.  This Privacy Policy applies to all websites, domains, software, offerings, information portals, and registries (“site”, “sites” and/or “services”) maintained by WordStream.

#### DEFINITIONS

  * ‘Non-personal data’ (NPD) is information that is in no way personally identifiable.

  * ‘Personal data’ (PD) means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. Personal Data is in many ways the same as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). However, Personal Data is broader in scope and covers more data.

  * A “visitor” is someone who merely browses our website. A “user” is someone who has registered with us to use or buy our services and products.




### Information We Collect

Generally, you control the amount and type of information that you provide to us when using our website.

#### OUR LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA (EEA Individuals Only)

If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for processing your personal data will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

However, we will normally collect personal data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.  In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to process personal data about you to protect your vital interests or those of another person.

If we collect and use your personal data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate our website and communicate with you as necessary to provide our products and services to you and for our legitimate commercial interest. These legitimate interests include, for example, responding to your queries, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or detecting or preventing illegal activities.  We may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal data, please contact us using the contact details provided above.

### We Collect Your Personal Data in the Following Ways

Cookies may contain text that can be read by the web server that delivered the cookie to you. The text contained in the cookie generally consists of a sequence of letters and numbers that uniquely identifies your computer or mobile device; it may contain other information as well.

#### WEB BEACONS

We may also use a technology called web beacons and other technologies, such as pixels and ad tags, to collect general information about your use of our website and your use of special promotions or newsletters. The information we collect by web beacons allows us to statistically monitor the number of people who open our emails. Web beacons also help us to understand the behavior of our customers, members, and visitors.

#### LOCATION INFORMATION

When you use a location-enabled device, we may collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent by a mobile device.  We also may use various locations to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.

#### NEW TECHNOLOGIES

As new technologies emerge, we may be able to improve our services or provide you with new ones, which means that we may create new ways to collect information on the site and our services.  If we offer a new service or new features to our existing site, for example, these changes may result in our collecting new information in order to improve your user experience.

#### GOOGLE ANALYTICS PRIVACY POLICY

Our website uses Google Analytics to collect information about the use of our website. Google Analytics collects information from users such as age, gender, interests, demographics, how often they visit our website, what pages they visit, and what other websites they have used before coming to our website. We use the information we get from Google Analytics to analyze traffic, remarket our products and services to users, improve our marketing, advertising, and to improve our website. We have enabled Google Analytics advertising features such as remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit our website, not your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected using Google Analytics with Personal Data. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our website, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google also uses specific identifiers to help collect information about the use of our website. For more information on how Google collects and processes your data, visit <https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/>

#### LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES

Our website may contain links to other websites. These websites are not under our control and are not subject to our privacy policy. These websites will likely have their own privacy policies.

It is your responsibility to check the privacy policies of these websites to see how they treat your Personal Data.

#### PROTECTING CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

Even though our website is not designed for use by anyone under the age of 16, we realize that a child under the age of 16 may attempt to access our website. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 16. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child is using our website, please contact us at dpo@wordstream.com.

You can always opt out of receiving further email correspondence from us. We will not sell, rent, or trade your email address to any unaffiliated third party without your permission except in the sale or transfer of our business, or if our company files for bankruptcy.

#### OUR SECURITY POLICY

We have built our website and products using industry-standard security measures and authentication tools to protect the security of your Personal Data.  We and the third parties who provide services for us, also maintain technical and physical safeguards to protect your Personal Data. We also periodically monitor our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, consistent with industry standards.  When we collect your credit card information through our website, we will encrypt it before it travels over the Internet using industry-standard technology for conducting secure online transactions. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee against the loss or misuse of your Personal Data or secure data transmission over the Internet because of its nature.

We strongly urge you to protect any password you may have for our website and to not share it with anyone. You should always log out of our website when you finish using it, especially if you are sharing or using a computer in a public place.  Please note that emails, instant messaging, and similar means of communication with other WordStream website users, if any, are not encrypted, so you should not communicate any confidential information through these means.

#### USE OF YOUR CREDIT CARD

You may have to provide a credit card to buy products and services from our website. We use third-party billing services. We use our commercially reasonable efforts to make sure your credit card number is kept strictly confidential by using only third-party billing services that use industry-standard encryption technology to protect your credit card number from unauthorized use. However, you understand and agree that we are in no way responsible for any misuse of your credit card number.

#### DATA TRANSFERS AND PRIVACY SHIELD

Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).

We have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this privacy notice.

WordStream has applied to participate in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss – U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union (EU) and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. WordStream has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles, and commits to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles as they apply to the personal data of EU and Swiss residents. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy notice and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>.

WordStream is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives under the Privacy Shield Framework and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. WordStream complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

WordStream commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal data in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles. Individuals in the EU or Switzerland may submit queries related to the processing of personal data under the Privacy Shield framework by contacting us directly at privacy@wordstream.com,  or by mail to WordStream, Inc., 101 Huntington Ave., 7th Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA, Attn: Privacyl.

WordStream has further committed to cooperate with the European data protection authorities (the “DPAs”) and/or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (the “Commissioner”), as applicable. If we have not been able to successfully resolve your query or complaint and you are based in the EEA or Switzerland, you may raise your query or complaint directly to the DPA or Commissioner. The services of the DPAs and Commissioner are provided at no cost to you. You can find details of the relevant DPA at http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm. WordStream will comply with any advice given by the DPAs and/or Commissioner, and take necessary actions to remediate any non-compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles.

If your inquiry still has not been satisfactorily resolved, you may have other recourse mechanisms such as invoking binding arbitration by the Privacy Shield Panel.

#### CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY

We reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time. If our company decides to change this privacy policy, we will post those changes on our website so that our visitors, users and customers are always aware of what information we collect, use, and disclose. If at any time we decide to disclose or use your Personal Data in a method different from that specified at the time it was collected, we will provide advance notice by email (sent to the email address on file in your account). Otherwise we will use and disclose our users’ and customers’ Personal Data in agreement with the privacy policy in effect when the information was collected. In all cases, your continued use of our website, services, and products after any change to this privacy policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
