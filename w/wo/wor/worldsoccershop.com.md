** What data do we collect and how do we use it?**  
365 collects and processes information about you in order to:

(i) identify you each time you visit a Web Site or wish to have a Service provided;   
(ii) process orders or applications submitted by you;  
(iii) improve our Services and Web Sites  
(iv) Customise your experience, for example, provide advertisements that we think are relevant to you and which support any specific requests for information you may make through keyword searches;  
(v) carry out research on the demographics, interests and behaviour of all of our customers; and  
(vi) send you information we think you may find useful, including information about new 365 products and services.

You may be asked, either when you register with us, or at other times, for information about yourself, such as your name, e-mail address, postal address and telephone number. You may also be asked to share with us your interests, hobbies and preferences. In addition, when you order certain goods or services from our Web Sites, we will need to know your credit/payment card number and expiration date.

You are under no obligation to provide this information, but if you don't then we may not be able to provide you with certain services or personalise your experience and tailor our Services for you (for example, tell you about special offers on things you're interested in). 

Third-Party Web Beacons: We use third-party web beacons from Yahoo! to help analyze where visitors go and what they do while visiting our website. Yahoo! may also use anonymous information about your visits to this and other websites in order to improve its products and services and provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by Yahoo!, [click here](https://reports.web.analytics.yahoo.com/optout,OptOut.vm?domain=a.analytics.yahoo.com).

** Non personal information**  
We may automatically collect non-personal information about you such as the type of internet browsers you use or the site from which you linked to our Web Sites.

**Use of Cookies**  
Cookies are pieces of information that a Web Site transfers to your hard drive to store and sometimes track information about you. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a Web Site if you do so. Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other servers, which means they cannot be used to track your movements around the web. Although they do identify a user's computer, cookies do not personally identify customers or passwords. Credit card information is not stored in cookies.

We use cookies for the following reasons:

(i) To identify who you are and to access your account information;  
(ii) To estimate our audience size and patterns;  
(iii) To ensure that you are not asked to register twice;  
(iv) To control how often visitors see similar ads;  
(v) To track preferences and to improve and update our Web Site; and  
(vi) To track the progress and number of entries in some of our promotions and contests.

365 may disclose aggregate statistics about our sales, our Web Site visitors and customers of our telephone services in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics will not include personally identifying information.

Our Web Site contains links to the sites of third parties. When you visit these sites, we suggest that you read their privacy policies. 365 is not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of such sites. 

We will only sell or rent your personal information to a third party either as part of a sale of the assets of a 365 company or having ensured that steps have been taken to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.

**Security**  
365 places a great importance on the security of all information associated with our customers. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of customer data under our control. For example, our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorised personnel have access to user information. With regard to our Web Sites, we use secure server software (SSL) to encrypt financial information you input before it is sent to us. While we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of data will not occur, we use our best efforts to prevent this.

This is necessary in order to process the information and to send you any information you have requested. Information submitted by you may be transferred by us to our other offices and to reputable third party suppliers, which may be situated outside the European Economic Area. Not all countries outside the EEA have data protection or privacy laws.
