<h3><strong>Anonymous Information</strong></h3>
<ul>

<p>Luther Seminary Web sites may log IP addresses and browser types,      but will not link IP addresses to personally identifiable      information. This means that a user's session may be tracked but      their identity will remain anonymous unless personal information is      specifically submitted.

<h3>Security and SSL</h3>
<p>There are cases where Luther Seminary Web sites may request or      provide personal information such as LutherNet username/password,      address or credit card information. To provide for your privacy in      these instances, Luther Seminary utilizes a secure server which      transmits and receives data in SSL-encrypted format.</p>
<p>SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer, a technology for managing      the security of online message transmission. SSL encrypts any      information sent from your browser to the server you are connected      to. This technology protects your information from being viewed by      an outside user.</p>
<p>Luther Seminary also has appropriate security measures in place      in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or      alteration of information that we have collected from you at our      site.</p>

These other sites may send and receive      cookies, collect data, or solicit personal information and may use      this information in ways that are not in accordance with Luther      Seminary’s privacy policy statement. Always be aware of the policies      of those sites you visit.</p>
<p>While Luther Seminary strives to protect its users' personal      information and privacy, it cannot guarantee the security of any      information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk.
