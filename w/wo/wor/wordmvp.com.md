# Word MVP Site - Privacy Policy

This is the Word MVP site. The articles on this website have been contributed by a diverse multinational collection of volunteers.

### No Information is Retainedd

For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server recognizes only your IP address and the pages you request from it. This is part of the normal functioning of every web server, and necessary for it to return the pages you request. This information is not normally retained for longer than a few milliseconds. 

We do not normally run web server logging. However we might occasionally enable it for maintenance purposes, for a few hours or days. If we did, the above information might be written to a log file, which would then be automatically deleted at the end of the day or the end of the week.

### Email Addressess

We do not store e-mail addresses.

We will never send email to you except in response to an email from you.

### Cookies

We do not set or read cookies.

### Postal Mail

We do not ask for or store postal addresses. We do not normally communicate by post: we will not send, and are not likely to respond to, postal mail. 

### Telephone Numbers

We do not ask for or store telephone numbers. Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers on-line will only receive telephone contact from us if they ask us to call them, and then only at our discretion. 

### Removing or Correcting Information

We do not store information from you, so we have no information to correct.

### Advertising

The MVP organization does not partner with or have any relationships with any ad server or marketing email (Spam) companies. The organization does not perform or participate in any marketing activities or involve ourselves in any other commercial activities. We do not store email addresses, so neither ourselves or anyone else can get your email address from us.

### Access to Information

Since we do not store information from you, we have no information to which we could give you access.
