# World Vision U.S. Web Privacy Policy | World Vision

**World Vision is committed to donor privacy.**

We respect your privacy and do not rent, sell, or exchange our mailing lists. We may disclose some personal information to select third parties in order to more effectively target our donor communications.

##  What does this mean?

We value your trust and assure you that we will always strive to be responsible in our management, truthful in our advertising, and cost-effective in our fundraising.

To most efficiently use the resources you entrusted to us, we may disclose to select third parties information regarding donation history. Information of this kind is used to enable World Vision to identify others like yourself interested in partnering with us to help children and their families. Information provided in donation history may include statistics such as total number of donations and value of donations for a set period of time. This information disclosure is done very carefully to ensure that your personal information is protected.

If you have questions or concerns, please contact our donor service center at 1-888-511-6548.

World Vision has been working alongside to the poor and suffering for more than 60 years, and we are continually working to ensure every dollar is used to its fullest for this purpose. Anything less would violate the trust we keep with you, the children, families, and communities we serve, and most importantly, with God.

We are committed to the highest standard of stewardship excellence. We will make every effort to honor any designation or preference you have stated. In certain circumstances, where a project is overfunded or cannot be carried out in accordance with your preference, the funds will be used for similar projects approved by the Board of Directors.

As with most other Internet sites, our web servers utilize “cookies” to track a user’s activity within our site as well as record the IP address of each visitor to this site. A cookie is a small data file that is stored on your computer. A cookie contains a unique identifying feature that allows our computer to recognize you when you return to the World Vision site. The recorded IP address tells us which domain you visited from (for instance, yahoo.com), but not your email address or other private and personal information. We use the information we record to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer this website more effectively, and to gather broad demographic information about what countries and domains our visitors come from and their behavior on our site.

We sometimes also use third-party service providers to serve advertisements (banners, video or test ads) on our behalf across the Internet. These third parties may collect non-personally identifiable information about your interaction with us. This Privacy Policy does not cover the collection methods or use of the information collected by these vendors, as they have their own privacy policies and may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To remove yourself from some or all NAI member advertising programs, please visit the [NAI opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ "Consumer Opt-Out | NAI") and follow the relevant instructions. In the alternative, if you wish to opt out of this type of data collection, you can disable cookies in your web browser. Please note that disabling cookies may diminish the experience of the websites you visit, including World Vision.

In some cases, our site uses securely encrypted contribution response forms for visitors who choose to use these forms to provide information, request information, and make donations. We collect your willingly submitted contact information (such as your email address), unique identifiers (in some cases, a World Vision donor account number), and financial information (such as a credit card type, number, and expiration date). Contact information from these response forms is used to process donations, as well as to provide receipts and other information about World Vision to our customers. The visitor’s contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary in order to resolve customer service issues or questions. Users may readily opt out of receiving future communications; see the “opt out” and “modifying your information” sections below. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for donations pledged. Unique identifiers (such as a World Vision account number) may be collected from website visitors to assist in matching current donation information with donor history in our record systems.

Those who choose to register through various “guestbook”-type features on our site may choose to give us certain contact information (such as their email address). These features may also request optional demographic information (such as zip code, age, or income level). Unless you opt out, we may use this contact information to send you additional information about World Vision and its programs. Your voluntarily provided contact information may also be used to contact you when necessary in order to resolve customer service issues or questions. You may readily opt out of receiving future communications; see the “opt out” and “modifying your information” sections below.

Our online surveys may ask visitors for contact information (such as their email address) as well as a variety of demographic and practical questions. We may use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about World Vision. The user’s contact information may also be used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the “opt out” and “modifying your information” sections below.

##  Opt out

Most points on our site provide users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us at the point where we request contact information about the visitor.
