(Each computer that connects to the Internet is assigned a unique number, an IP address, for identification purposes). The log file does not capture a visitor's email address or passwords. For services that require payment (eg. certain events, products and subscriptions), we also collect credit card information (eg. account name, number and expiration date).

In order to best serve our customers, we may send updates that contain important information about our products and services.
