## How we use and disclose your subscriber data + lists

**What we do**

  * WordFly requires an account name, username, and password to log in.
  * Your password and security question answer are encrypted and known only to you. We cannot see your passwords. We can only reset them. If you forget your password, you will need to reset it in WordFly by answering your security question correctly.
  * Any data that WordFly sends or receives is electronically encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) when sending over network resources. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. The WordFly web application and associated mail systems use safeguards that greatly reduce the risk of a security breach, DOS (denial of service) attack, and other Internet-based attacks. 
  * Dedicated support staff and monitoring systems track the security and overall health of the WordFly services.
  * WordFly services are protected by redundant enterprise-grade firewalls that are monitored 24/7/365.
  * In addition to the security offered by our hardware and software manufacturers, we perform frequent security testing and auditing of all of network and server systems.
  * The WordFly servers are hosted in a Tier 1 datacenter with on-site security guards, video surveillance, and a highly restrictive access system. 
  * Each WordFly client uses their own database, reducing the amount of data that could be breached at any one time.
  * Users are automatically logged out after 60 minutes of inactivity
  * A very small group of carefully screened and trusted employees of POP have access to subscriber data + lists.



**Your responsibilities as a user**

  * Click the Sign Out link in the upper-right corner of WordFly when you are finished using WordFly to prevent unauthorized access from your computer.
  * Remove users when they no longer work at your organization.
  * Maintain the confidentiality of any account name and password provided to you. You are solely responsible for uses of any account provided to you, whether or not authorized by you.

  * Use the Secure Upload link provided inside WordFly if you need to send sensitive data, such as subscriber lists, for troubleshooting purposes.



**If a breach occurs**

  * In the event that a security breach that affects you and your subscribers occurs, we will notify you as soon as possible via the email address you provided to us. We will follow-up with information about what steps have been taken to rectify the security breach.
