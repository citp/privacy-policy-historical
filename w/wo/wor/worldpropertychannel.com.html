				entities, subsidiaries, whether or not wholly owned (herein known as " WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ ") 
				and specifically, it outlines the types of information that WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ gathers about 
				you ("User") while you are using the www.worldpropertyjournal.com website or any other related website 
				that uses a WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ video service now or in the future. This Privacy Notice is 
				incorporated into and is subject to the WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Terms of Use. Your use of the WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Websites and any personal information you provide on the WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Sites remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Notice and our Terms of Use.</p> 
				<br><div class="recHeaders">Use of Website</div>

				fostering consumer confidence in the Internet, Internet advertising and direct marketing. If you 
				as a visitor choose to register or submit information to the WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ via the 
				WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Website, you agree to the use of such data in accordance with this Privacy 
				Notice.  Please note that the WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Website contains links to other websites, 
				including, without limitation, websites maintained by WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ and their respective 
				affiliates, which may not be governed by this Privacy Notice. Also note that WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ may use third parties to host all or portions of, or to assist in maintaining, the 
				WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Website.</p>

				we may modify this Privacy Notice from time to time without the consent of users by providing 
				advance notice on the WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Website before implementing such modifications. 
				We encourage you to review our Privacy Notice periodically to become aware of any changes that 
				may have occurred. If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Notice, or do not feel that

				addition, the webmasters may, where necessary, use your information for various site related tasks.</p>

				your personal information, your consent, or your opt-in or opt-out choices via email to:

				<br><div class="recHeaders">Usage Data</div>
				<br><p>When you access the Internet, the computers that host websites that you visit (Web servers) 
				automatically receive some anonymous information ("Usage Data"). This "usage data" may include a record 
				of which pages a Web browser has visited. WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ servers receive usage data when 
				customers visit a WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Website. WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ may use usage data to 
				provide advertising about goods and services that may be of interest to WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ 
				customers, or to provide customized features and services. By using this Website, automatically consent 
				to WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ using this information as specified herein.</p>
				<br><div class="recHeaders">Children's Privacy Protection</div>
				<br><p>WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ understands the importance of protecting children's privacy in the 
				interactive online world.  The WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Website is covered by this Privacy Notice and 
				is not designed for or intentionally targeted at children 13 years of age or younger.  It is not our 
				WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL's policy to intentionally collect or maintain information about anyone under the 
				age of 13.</p> 
				<br><div class="recHeaders">Security</div>
				<br><p>WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ has in place reasonable commercial standards of technology and 
				operational security designed to protect all personally identifiable information provided by visitors 
				via the WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Website from unauthorized third party access. WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve 
				the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the 
				security of any information you transmit to WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ and you do so at your own risk. 
				Once we receive your transmission of information, WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ makes commercially 
				reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a 
				guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any 
				of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p> 
				<br><p>If WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify 
				you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ may 
				post a notice on the WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Websites if a security breach occurs. Depending on 
				where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.</p> 
				<br><div class="recHeaders">Cookies and Other Technologies</div>
				<br><p>WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ and where applicable, its affiliate or advertisers may use various kinds 
				of software devices to collect information about Internet use. Small files called "cookies" may be 
				attached to your Web browser. These files identify your browser and save information so that websites 
				can recognize you. You can set your browser to disable cookies, but some WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ 
				Websites (and other websites) may not work properly if you do this. A persistent cookie remains after 
				you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the 
				site. To ensure that the WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Websites are well managed and to facilitate 
				improved navigation within it, cookies (small text files stored in a user's browser) or web beacons 
				(electronic images that allow WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Websites to count visitors who have accesse? a 
				particular page and to access certain cookies) are used on the WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Website to 
				collect aggregate data.  Cookies and web beacons may be used to track information and identify 
				categories of visitors by items such as IP address, domain, browser type and pages visited.  In 
				addition, on some websites, WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ and its advertisers may use small bits of code 
				called "one-pixel gifs," or "clear gifs" embedded in some web pages, to make cookies more effective. 
				Pixel tags also enables WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ to send email messages in a format that customers 
				can read. And they tell us whether emails have been opened to assure that we're only sending messages 
				that are of interest to our customers. This information may be used to analyze the number of visitors 
				to different areas of the WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Website.</p> 
				<br><div class="recHeaders">Third Party Advertisers - Links to Other Sites.</div>
				<br><p>WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ may use advertising companies to deliver ads on some WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Websites. The advertising companies may also receive some anonymous information about ad 
				viewing by Internet users on WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Websites and other Internet sites. This 
				information may be associated with a customer's web browser, but cannot be associated with a name or 
				e-mail address without the customer's permission. (This means that advertising companies may know where 
				your computer goes on the Internet, but they don't know who you are unless you tell them.) This Site may 
				contain links to other independent third-party WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Websites ("Linked Sites"). These 
				Linked Sites are provided solely as a convenience to our Users. Such Linked Sites are not under WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL's control, and WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ is not responsible for and does not endorse the 
				content of such Linked Sites, including any information or materials contained on such Linked Sites.</p>
				<br><p>WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to 
				serve advertisements within the WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad 
				networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on 
				the WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They 
				may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness 
				of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.</p>
				<br><p>WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ does not provide any personally identifiable information to these 
				third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or 
				feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, If you go to another website, 
				including an advertiser's Website (for example by clicking on an ad), and request information or enter a 
				contest, be aware that you may be authorizing another company, including an advertising company, to use 
				information you supply. WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ is not responsible for these other websites, it is up 
				to the User to read their privacy policies, and choose whether to let them collect information about what 
				you do on the Internet. Please note that if an advertiser asks WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ to show an 
				advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men 
				ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the 
				advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. 
				The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Sites, such 
				as the number of times you viewed an ad (but no? any personally identifiable information), to determine 
				which ads to deliver to you.</p>
				<br><p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for 
				more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL's Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other 
				advertisers or WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Websites.</p><p><br></p><p>The services contained in this section enable WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL to monitor and analyze web traffic and can be used to keep track of User behavior.<br><br><br>Google Analytics (Google)<br><br>Google Analytics is a web analysis service provided by Google Inc.
