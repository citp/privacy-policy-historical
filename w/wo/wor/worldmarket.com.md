We value your privacy. This Notice describes our privacy policy and practices. By visiting this web site, you accept the policy and practices described in this Notice.  


**Information We Receive**

Cost Plus, Inc. and its subsidiaries receive various types of information from or about you in the normal course of conducting our business. For example, you give us information, your web browser gives us information, e-mail from you gives us information, and shippers and other sources give us information. Cost Plus, Inc. and its subsidiaries value the confidence of its customers and are not in the business of selling that information to others. We may share customer information, but only with other subsidiaries of Cost Plus, Inc. or as necessary to complete a transaction.

We do release information when it is appropriate to comply with law, enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Cost Plus, Inc. or its subsidiaries, or our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. We may buy or sell other companies as part of our continuing development of our business. In such transactions, customer information may be one of the transferred assets. Also, in the unlikely event that Cost Plus, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, including its affiliates, customer information may be included as one of the transferred assets. Any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Terms and Conditions. If you have any concerns or a claim, please use the contact information provided under Terms and Conditions. We anticipate the Privacy Notice and Terms and Conditions will continue to change over time. The Conditions or Notice in effect at the time of use are the ones that will apply.
