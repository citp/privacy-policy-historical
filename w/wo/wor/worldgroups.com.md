**Individual User Information**

**Disclosure**

  * GROUPS will not generally disclose any personal information to third parties without your consent. The term "personal information" is any information, data, or record that relates to your use of GROUPS and identifies you or your individual account, including without limitation your account information, content, personal data, and/or sensitive information. 
  * By using GROUPS, you authorize us to disclose your personal information if we have a good faith belief that the access, use, preservation, or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request; enforce applicable Terms of Service, including the investigation of potential violations thereof; detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; or protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of GROUPS, its users, or the public as required or permitted by law. In your capacity as both the sender and the recipient of electronic communications on or through GROUPS, you expressly authorize us to access your personal information and to disclose your personal information to government agencies pursuant to valid legal procedures; this authorization relates to the personal information that you distribute on or through GROUPS as well as to the personal information that you store on GROUPS. 
  * We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. 



**Your Own Responsibilities**

  * Be cautious about disclosing your personal information to others in public forums in GROUPS communications services. GROUPS makes chatrooms, logs, and other public forums available to its users. Any information that is voluntarily disclosed by you in these areas becomes public information and GROUPS is not responsible for your disclosures or the consequences of those disclosures. **  **
