##### We Collect Only Necessary Information  
    ... And Use It Carefully

  * When you place an order, we ask for your name, e-mail and mailing addresses, credit card number and expiration date and the phone number of your shipping address. We need this information to process and fulfill your orders, and to notify you of your order status. 
  * When you request newsletters or reminder services, we ask for your e-mail address. Then we forward any information you request to your e-mail account. 
  * When you post a customer review, we ask for your initials and e-mail address. However, you may choose whether to have your e-mail address displayed with your review. 
  * When you enter one of our contests or promotions, we may ask for your name, phone number, e-mail and mailing addresses. We use this information to administer the contest and notify you if you win. 
  * If you have provided us with an e-mail address, we may use it occasionally to notify you about important changes to our web sites, new services, or special offers. If you prefer not to receive these updates, we respect your wishes. Simply [contact us](https://web.archive.org/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/ExecMacro/worldpantry/website/contact.d2w/report) with your request. Make sure to let us know if you have given us more than one e-mail account.

  * We provide a high level of security for our computer systems, databases and networks to protect all customer information in our systems. 
  * To provide you with improved services, we may use aggregated pools of data (without personal identifiers) for research and commercial purposes. 
  * We may also provide aggregate statistics about our sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third parties, but these statistics do not include any personally identifiable information. 



##### We Respect Your Consent

By using the stores in our Artisan Network, you consent to the collection and use of this information by WorldPantry.com. We pledge to keep you informed and updated on our privacy policy.
