###### Overview of Future Students’ Services

Future Students collects information about the website(s) that you visit and the advertisements that you see while online via Future Students’ technology provider (the “Technology”). You may encounter the Technology when:

  * Future Students or one of our Advertisers displays online advertisements on a website that you visit;
  * when you open an email that contains an advertisement placed by Future Students or one of our Advertisers; and/or
  * when one of the Advertisers places one of Future Students’ web beacons on a website that you visit.



We use the information collected by the Technology in order to help make the Advertisements you see more relevant to you, and for Advertisement delivery and reporting purposes.

###### Information Collected via the Services

The Technology collects and uses information regarding your interaction with the Services, including, without limitation, the IP address used to access the Internet, the type of browser used, which and how many Advertiser webpages have been viewed, search terms entered on Advertiser websites, referral URLs, and the date and time of website visits.

Future Students uses this information to analyse trends, identify the audience most likely to respond to an advertisement and to tailor advertisement placements for Future Students’ Advertisers accordingly. This information may be shared with third parties (see the “Disclosure of Information to Third Parties” section below). This information will not be used by Future Students to contact or identify any person individually.

###### Cookies and Web Beacons

Future Students uses cookies and web beacons in connection with the Technology.
