Workday will not share or distribute any such Customer Data except as provided in the contractual agreement between Workday and the customer, or as may be required by law. [Please refer to the Workday Service Privacy Policy for more details.](https://web.archive.org/en-us/service-privacy.html)  


If you are a user of the Workday Service, your use of Workday is governed by your organization’s policies. Please direct your privacy questions or concerns to your employer or your organization’s Workday administrators.  


### How Workday Uses Information

**Information Collection**  
You may choose to provide us with your personal information, such as your name, email address, company information, street address, and telephone number.

In order to access some areas of Workday, including Workday Community, you will need to have an account with a username and password. As part of your account, you may choose to provide us with additional information, such as a photo, social media profiles, or areas of expertise.

If you register to attend a Workday-sponsored event, we will require certain information including your name, email address, company, and in some instances, emergency contact. When registering for any event, we may also require you to provide billing information (such as billing name and address, and credit card number).

Workday or Workday Service providers may use website tracking technologies to observe your activities, interactions, preferences, transactional information, and other computer and connection information (such as an IP address) relating to your use of our websites and services. We may also use log files, cookies, and similar technologies to collect information about the pages you view, links you click, and other actions you take when accessing our websites, services, or emails.

When you choose to use a Workday mobile app we will collect information from your device, such as your photos, contacts, or precise geolocation data, to enable some functions in accordance with your device settings. For more information about our mobile app, please see the section below on **Mobile Applications**.

**Use**  
This section describes some of the ways in which Workday uses the information we collect. Please note that there may be other uses, which we would describe to you when we collect the information.

Workday uses the information we collect about you to provide to the Workday websites, services, and support. For example, if you provide information to us in a “Contact Us” form, we will use your information to respond to the request.

Workday uses your information for event planning and management, including registration, billing, and ways to connect with other event attendees, or to contact you further about relevant products and services. Any information you provide about emergency contacts or dietary preferences would be used for your safety and health purposes.

We use the contact information we collect from you and information about your activity on our websites to send you information that we believe may be of interest to you, such as product announcements, newsletters, educational materials, and details on upcoming events. We also use it to send administrative information, such as notices related to products, services, or policy changes.  


We use the information we collect to understand how our websites and services are being used and to make improvements. For example, we may use the search queries entered into Workday Community to improve search capabilities or performance. As another example, we may use questions posted or comments on Workday Community to enrich the content or help guide future enhancements to our products and services.  


Your information also may be used to personalize your experience on our websites. Workday or our services providers use website tracking technologies to display products or features that are tailored to your interests and to present advertising on other sites. For more information on these technologies see the section “Tracking Technologies and Targeted Advertising.” For more information on managing your choices in relation to cookies, click **Cookie Preferences** in the footer.  


We may use your information to diagnose website technical problems, as well as to prevent, detect, mitigate, and investigate potential security issues, as well as fraudulent or illegal activity.

In some instances, we may combine the information you have provided to us with other publicly available information. We may also purchase data from third parties and combine this with information we have already collected. We use this combined information to update, expand, and analyze our marketing leads; identify new customers; and create more tailored advertising.

If you participate in a Workday-offered education or training course, your enrollment and attendance information will be recorded to track and potentially report your participation and completion. For example, completion of Workday certifications by a services partner may be visible to Workday and our customers, and completion of a training course may also be visible to the entity making the training available to you. This registration and tracking may be conducted by third parties on behalf of Workday.

**Disclosure**  
Workday may share information with Workday affiliates, and third-party service providers or vendors contracted to provide services on our behalf. These third-party service providers or vendors may use information we provide to them only as instructed by Workday.

Workday may offer the following solely or jointly with third parties or partners: webinars, events, whitepaper downloads, or other services related to Workday offerings or services. We may share your contact information and interests in these offerings or services with these approved third parties to communicate with you about Workday.

When you attend an event (either sponsored by Workday or one where Workday is a participating vendor) and have your badge scanned, your information will be shared with Workday, as well as with any partner or third party participating in that event, and potentially with the entity sponsoring your attendance at the event. For example, if your badge is scanned as you attend a session at a Workday-sponsored conference, Workday and any co-presenters will have access to that information to understand who was in attendance, and potentially follow up with you on relevant products or services. If you do not want your information shared with Workday or partners in this manner, do not have your badge scanned. If your badged is scanned by a partner or a third party at an event, your information will be governed by that party’s privacy statement.

Workday may disclose information if we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal processes; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; (c) enforce the website Terms and Conditions; and/or (d) act to protect the interests of our users or others.

If Workday goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal information may be among the assets transferred.

**Workday Forums**  
You may post comments or questions on our websites; for example, on a blog, community site, or developer forum. Some of these forums allow you to provide your personal information and create a profile. Personal information you submit in these public areas can be read and collected by others who access them. You should only post personal information to online forums with the awareness that the information will be available to others in the forum (unless stated otherwise). Comments posted by individuals in an online forum reflect their own views and should not be considered to reflect the opinion of Workday.

### Tracking Technologies and Targeted Advertising

Workday or Workday service providers may observe your activities, interactions, preferences, transactional information, and other computer and connection information (such as an IP address) relating to your use of Workday websites. We may collect and store this information and combine this information with other personal information provided to Workday.

Workday and our service providers use cookies and other similar technologies, such as web beacons, HTML5 Local Storage, local shared objects, tags, and scripts on our websites and in email communications. We use these technologies to authenticate your access to various areas of our websites, understand your interests, analyze web traffic, combat fraud, provide interest-based advertising, improve our products and services as further described above in the Use section, and tailor content to your preferences. In messages we send, we may use these technologies to track their effectiveness.  


You can configure your browser settings to manage certain tracking technology interactions. For some tracking technologies you may need to take additional steps to manage their use and removal. Some of these technologies may operate across all of your browsers.

Online advertising may use information collected about your web browsing behavior, such as the pages you have visited or the searches you have conducted. This information may be used to display more relevant advertisements and content to you on non-Workday websites. The information used for targeted advertising may come from Workday or through third-party ad networks.
