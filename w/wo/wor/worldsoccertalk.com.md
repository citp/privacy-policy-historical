World Soccer Talk knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy very seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting our website, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy covers World Soccer Talk’s treatment of personal information that World Soccer Talk gathers when you are on the World Soccer Talk website and when you use World Soccer Talk services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that World Soccer Talk does not own or control, or to individuals that World Soccer Talk does not employ or manage.

**Information Collected by World Soccer Talk** We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website. This information allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience. We do not process this information in a way that is incompatible with this objective. We collect the following types of information from our World Soccer Talk users:

1\. Information You Provide to Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.

2\. Automatic Information:

  * We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. World Soccer Talk and its authorized agents automatically receive and record certain “traffic data” on their server logs from your browser including your IP address, World Soccer Talk cookie information, and the page you requested. World Soccer Talk uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends and administer the website.

World Soccer Talk may send out e-mails with World Soccer Talk-related news, products, offers, surveys or promotions.

**Cookies  
**Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. World Soccer Talk cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is.

We recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use some of World Soccer Talk’s coolest features.

World Soccer Talk’s advertising partners may place a cookie on your browser that makes it possible to collect anonymous non-personally identifiable information that ad delivery systems use to present more relevant ads.  If you would prefer to opt-out of this standard practice, please visit our advertising partner Platform-A’s privacy policy and opt-out page.
