TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, this web site has agreed to notify you of:

  * What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identifiable information is collected from you through the web site.

  * How the information is used. 
  * With whom the information may be shared.

**Traffic Data**   
Each time a visitor comes to a WorldNetDaily.com site, our servers collect some basic technical information, including the visitor's domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on to the internet from aol.com or whitehouse.gov), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the URL a user visited prior to clicking through to a WorldNetDaily.com site) and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform).

We also track the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from, and how traffic flows within the WorldNetDaily.com sites, etc.) We may merge information about visitors and visits into group data, which may be shared on an aggregate basis with our advertisers.

However, we will not disclose your individual identity or personally identifiable data to any party.

When we do present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be able to identify you or contact you.

**WorldNetDaily.com and cookies**   
A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a server and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies in a very limited manner, primarily to help deliver advertisements so that you won't receive the same advertisement too many times. We use cookies to identify unique browsers that visit us and to track site navigation. We also use cookies on our shopping site to make the ordering process more convenient for visitors. Cookies are used with our online polls to insure accurate results by allowing only one vote per computer on the current questions.

Other sites that place advertisements on our site, or which we may provide a link referencing an article that is available to view on WorldNetDaily.com, also have the ability to assign their cookies to you in a process that WorldNetDaily.com does not control.

Cookies cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines. So these advertisers will not know who a visitor is, nor will they have any personally identifiable information about a visitor.

**WorldNetDaily.com News Alert feature**   
After signing up to receive a WorldNetDaily.com News Alert by e-mail, users will begin to receive a brief synopsis of current news events available on the WorldNetDaily.com site, delivered on a daily or weekly basis. Additionally users may receive infrequent other announcements from WorldNetDaily.com. We collect subscriber's e-mail addresses in order to distribute the News Alerts and announcements and do not otherwise share them with other companies or partners. WorldNetDaily.com (WorldNetDaily.com, Inc.) respects your right to the privacy of the personal information you provide us on our site. Unless you designate otherwise or we state otherwise in this policy or at the time information is collected, any personal information you provide will not be known to any other party except you and WorldNetDaily.com. This policy is intended to explain how your personal information is collected and how it will be treated.

Users can choose to unsubscribe from WorldNetDaily.com News Alerts at any time by following the unsubscribe procedures found in each e-mail or by visiting the [News Alert sign-up page](http://www.wnd.com/resources/mailingList.asp).

**Online Retailing**  
WorldNetDaily.com operates an online store, ShopNetDaily.com. In the course of processing orders, we may collect certain personal information for the purpose of fulfilling customer orders. We will save this information as needed to keep responsible records and handle complaints. We do not share this information with any telemarketing firms. Your phone number is necessary only for credit card verification purposes and issues of customer service related to purchases from ShopNetDaily.com.

**Changing User Information**   
To make changes to your email or physical address on your ShopNetDaily account, contact our customer service department at [customerservice@worldnetdaily.com](mailto:customerservice@worldnetdaily.com) or by calling toll free 1- 800-496-3266.

**Promotions**   
From time to time, WorldNetDaily.com may sponsor contests or other events that require the collection, processing and storage of individual contact and demographic information (e.g., your age and state of residence) to be used for the event. WorldNetDaily.com may also co-sponsor these events along with other companies, in which case the user's individual contact and demographic information is likely to be shared with these other participating sponsors. A registrant's personal contact and demographic information will not be disclosed to third-party or non-participating organizations without the user's prior consent, and WorldNetDaily.com will request that co-sponsors of such events uphold the privacy of the registrant's information.

**Surveys**   
WorldNetDaily.com may from time to time conduct voluntary surveys of visitors to the site to obtain aggregate demographic information about them. Such information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with advertisers and other third parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals.

**E-mail a Friend**  
If a user elects to use our "E-mail a Friend" service available on each news story and column, we ask him or her for the friend's name and e-mail address. WorldNetDaily will automatically send the friend an e-mail version of the page requested. WorldNetDaily does not store this information after the e-mail has been sent.

**Other disclosure of personal information**   
WorldNetDaily.com will not otherwise use or disclose your personal information without your consent except (i) as described in this Privacy Policy, or (ii) as required by law, court order or as requested by other government or law-enforcement authority. This policy does not protect information you post to any online bulletin board, chat room, newsgroup or other public forum within or outside our sites.

**Unsubscribe and data removal policies**   
To unsubscribe, please visit our [subscriber services web page](http://www.worldnetdaily.com/resources/mailingList.asp) and choose which action you would like to take regarding subscriptions.

**Other sites**  
WorldNetDaily.com contains many links to other sites on the Web. We cannot control and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these linked sites, because their privacy practices may differ from ours.

**Who can I ask if I have any additional questions?**   
If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact [privacy@worldnetdaily.com](mailto:privacy@worldnetdaily.com). If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/users/watchdog.html). TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the website to resolve your concerns.

**Notification of Changes**   
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our website notifying users of the change. In some case where we post a notice we will also e-mail users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.

If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at:
