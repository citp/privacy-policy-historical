<div class="space"></div><div>Effective Date: 23 August 2010<br>(Last Updated 10 Outubro 2010)</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>Welcome to World War Online,
a personal online service operated by Chilltime Lda. ("Chilltime")
which consists of, among other things, software that you have downloaded or are
about to download, any software that you have embedded on a web site or are
about to embed (“Chilltime Games”), any applications created by Chilltime and
available through social networking sites (“SNS Apps”), any software running on
Chilltime's servers, (“Chilltime Software”), content, related documentation,
information on the Chilltime domain, and information made available by users to
each other through the Chilltime Software (collectively, the “Service”). Your
privacy is important to us and, as described in this Privacy Policy, we have
designed the Service to protect information about you from unauthorized
disclosure to others. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and, in
certain circumstances, share your personally identifying information. Please read
this Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any questions, feel free to
contact us.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>By using the Service,
you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined
in this Privacy Policy, as such policy may be amended from time to time. We may
update the Privacy Policy and if we do, we will post a notice that changes have
been made on the website www.Chilltime.com. You should visit this page
periodically to review any changes to the Privacy Policy.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div class="bold">What We Collect</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>Chilltime gives you a
number of options regarding what information you will give us:</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>When
you register a profile with Chilltime, your profile including any information
(name, address, gender) will be registered with Chilltime. When you identify
yourself on a Chilltime site, you may identify yourself using a Chilltime
account. When you identify yourself on a Chilltime site, you may identify
yourself through a social network account in which Chilltime may receive
additional information about your profile. </div>

<div class="space"></div><div>In each case, we will
collect and record the information you have provided. Other than names and
email addresses provided at your discretion, we don't generally collect any
“Personally Identifying Information” about our users (such as social security
number, telephone number, street address, drivers license number, etc.),
exception being for billing and payments where we store your billing
information such as name, street address, phone number. We may offer you the
opportunity to submit other information about yourself (such as gender, age,
occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, etc.), or we may be able to collect
that information from social networking systems on which you have used Chilltime
Games or SNS Apps (in accordance with the terms of use of those systems), which
would then also be covered by this Privacy Policy.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>In addition to
information about yourself, you may choose to share information about yourself
in other content ("Content"), such as in games. Any action you
perform with other players are considered public, and at your own discretion. </div>

<div class="space"></div><div>In specific cases we may provide links to your 
	profile in your SNS, this will enable members to interact with you and improve 
	your experience.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>When you use an SNS
App on your social network page or use an SNS App on someone else's page, we
may record information regarding the use of that SNS App, and we may collect
other information that is visible on your social network page in accordance
with the relevant terms of use associated with that page.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>Note that since most Chilltime
Software is served through SNS Apps, it is your responsibility to read and
accept their Terms of Use, as well as Privacy Policy prior to continuing.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>When you invite new
members into your network or send messages through the Service, we collect and
maintain on secure servers the information associated with those messages,
including email addresses and content.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>We may use
information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not
limited to newspapers and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging
services, Chilltime games and other users of Chilltime, to supplement your
profile.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>Chilltime may contain
links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy
practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they
leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that
collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies
solely to information collected by Chilltime.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>You should also be
aware that most content delivered through Chilltime games originates with
another content provider. Such other content providers may place “cookies” on
your browser, or otherwise gather information about you, including by asking
you to provide information through the site itself. </div>

<div class="space"></div><div>Finally, in order to
provide the best possible service and to allow us to make certain internal
reports and make recommendations, we collect aggregate information about the
use of the Service, including information about users accessing the Chilltime
site or playing Chilltime games or using SNS Apps on other sites, such as
internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring / exit
pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, domain
names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of
time spent on particular pages, and the date and time (“Activity Information”).</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>By using the Service,
you consent to our retaining all the above-described information in anonymous
form as long as Chilltime sees fit.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div class="bold">Children Under The
Age Of 13</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>Chilltime does not
knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of
13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do
not attempt to register for Chilltime or send any information about yourself to
us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one
under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on Chilltime. In the
event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child
under age 13 we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you
believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13,
please contact us at privacy@chilltime.com .</div>

<div class="space"></div><div class="bold">Children Between The
Ages of 13 and 18</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>We recommend that
minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any
information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div class="bold">How We Use Your
Information</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>We do not sell or
rent your “Personally Identifiable Information” to any third party. We may,
however, use certain information about you that is not personally identifiable.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>We use public
information collected to determine the kinds of content that you would like to
view and to assist any advertisers in targeting their advertising.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>We also use your
name, email address and other information on our system to notify you of new
product releases, service notifications, and to solicit your feedback and
input. Those emails will contain links for preference management and where
appropriate, unsubscribe links should you decide you do not want to receive
further emails.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>You understand and
agree that we may access, preserve, and disclose any information we may have
about you and the contents of your account if required to do so by law or in a
good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably
necessary to avoid liability, to comply with legal process, such as a search
warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or to protect our rights and
property, or that of our affiliates or the public. Chilltime is not required to
question or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other
similar governmental request that Chilltime receives.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>Chilltime may
maintain copies of your Content indefinitely, or delete certain Content in
whole or in part if Chilltime determines, in its sole discretion, that such
Content constitutes an "Infringing Posting" or a "Prohibited
Posting" as defined in our Terms of Use or for any or no reason.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>We also use
non-Personally Identifiable Information and certain technical information about
your computer and your access of the Service (including your internet protocol
address) in order to operate, maintain and manage the Service. </div>

<div class="space"></div><div>Chilltime may
disclose information about you to its partners in order to provide the Service,
resolve service problems and correct errors in the Service, to communicate with
you about the Service, to provide you with advertising and promotional
information in connection with the Service, and to enhance your experience on
the Service. However, we do not give our partners an independent right to share
this information.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>Due to our
contractual obligations with these third parties and the need to share
information to deliver and support the Service, we cannot provide you with the
opportunity to opt-out of sharing information (whether Personally Identifiable
Information or other information) with these third parties.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>Chilltime, certain of
its partners, and each of their contractors and employees may view the Content
that you transmit to the service to provide the Service and otherwise perform
the tasks set forth in this Privacy Policy.</div>


<div class="space"></div><div class="bold">Controlling Your
Personal Information</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>Be advised that if
you send messages or post material containing personal information, that
information may be collected and used by others.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>You can terminate
your account at any time which will remove your profile and other personal
information from view. Chilltime, however, may (but is not obligated to) keep
information about you that is on its system following your termination. Please
contact Chilltime to terminate your account or for any other questions about
your personal information.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div class="bold">Transfer of
Information</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>We reserve the right
to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership
of Chilltime or the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Chilltime
related to the business which collected such information, such as acquisition
by or merger with another company. In such an event, Chilltime will notify
users who have provided email addresses when information about those users is
transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div class="bold">Others' Information</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>You may decide to
provide us with another person's email address so that person may be invited to
join Chilltime or so that we may facilitate your communication with other
people through the Service (such as when you upload an address book).</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>You may also provide
us with another person's contact information for purposes of delivering
information through SNS Apps. We use this information to contact and, if
necessary, remind that person that he or she has been invited to join Chilltime
or received content through an SNS App. All invitees are provided with the
option not to receive further invitations from Chilltime. We may disclose such
information if required to do so in order to comply with legal process, as
described above.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div class="bold">Cookies</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>The Service sends
"cookies" to your computer when you access the Chilltime site, or
otherwise view content through a Chilltime game, or use an SNS App and the
Service uses such cookies as described in here. The Service uses cookies to
improve the quality of our service, make recommendations, and make the Service
easier to use for our users. A cookie is a small text file recorded on your
hard drive that identifies you as a unique user and contains certain
information about your particular login session and/or your use of the Service.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div class="bold">Use of Information</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>Chilltime may contain
links to other web sites, and content in Chilltime game and SNS Apps may be
hosted by other web sites. In addition, as described above, most content
offered through Chilltime games or SNS Apps is served or hosted by other sites.
These other sites maintain their own policies regarding cookies and the
collection and use of personal information. It is up to you to review those
policies yourself. </div>

<div class="space"></div><div class="bold">Third-Party Advertising Companies</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>We use third-party
advertising companies to serve ads on our site and on certain Chilltime games
and SNS Apps. Our system and the third-party advertising technology uses
information derived from Activity Information, Chilltime's cookies on your hard
drive, your visits to our site, the Chilltime games that you view and the SNS
Apps you use to target advertising within our site or Chilltime games or SNS
Apps. In addition, our advertisers may use other third-party advertising
technology to target advertising on our site and other sites. In the course of
advertisements being served to you, a unique third-party cookie or cookies may
be placed on your computer. Similarly, third-party advertising companies may
provide us with pixel tags (also called “clear gifs” or “beacons”) to help
manage and optimize our online advertising. Beacons enable us to recognize a
browser's cookie when a browser visits the site on which the beacon is located,
and to learn which banner ads bring users to a given site. </div>

<div class="space"></div><div>Chilltime does not
provide any Personally Identifiable Information to third-party advertising
companies. Note, however, that if an advertiser asks Chilltime to show an
advertisement to users with certain characteristics (for example, women ages
18-24) or a segment of that group (for example, women ages 18-24 who have
viewed certain categories of content) and you respond to that advertisement,
the third-party advertising company may conclude that you have the
characteristics of the audience that they are trying to reach.</div>

<div class="space"></div><div class="bold">Security</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>Chilltime takes
appropriate precautions to protect our users' information. Your account
information is located on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter
sensitive information (such as credit card number or your password), we encrypt
that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). (To learn more
about SSL, go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer). Because
email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure communications, we
request that you not send private information to us by email or instant
messaging services. If you have any questions about the security of Chilltime
Web Site, please contact us at privacy@chilltime.com</div>

<div class="space"></div><div class="bold">Additional Questions</div>

<div class="space"></div><div>Again, feel free to
contact us by sending an email to privacy@chilltime.com , any time, if you have
further questions about Chilltime or this Privacy Policy, or if you want to
receive a previous version of this document.</div>
