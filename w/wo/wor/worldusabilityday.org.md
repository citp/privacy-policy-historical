# Privacy Policy | World Usability Day

The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the web site [www.worldusabilityday.org](http://www.worldusabilityday.org/ "www.worldusabilityday.org").

## Personal Information

The registration form requires visitors to give us contact information (like their name and email address) when registering as a volunteer/supporter/sponsor.

Visitors' contact information is used to contact the visitors when necessary.

The UPA does not rent, sell, or give away mailing addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, or fax numbers for members or visitors. However, we do reserve the right to release this information to the coordinating team for World Usability Day 2006,2007 and 2008.

Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level).
