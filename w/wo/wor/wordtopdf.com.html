        <p> The types of information we collect and handle normally comprises:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identity and contact details such as name, email address, phone number, credit card
            information, and mailing address</li>
          <li>Product and service preferences </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Normally, we collect your personal information from you but on occasions we may
          obtain information about you from others. We may collect additional information
          about your company to provide better service for volume orders. </p>
        <p> We only collect information which is necessary for the purposes of your dealings
          with us. We do not collect information about anyone's political or religious beliefs,
          ethnic background, criminal history or sexual preferences.</p>
        <h2> Purpose of collection &amp; use of personal information </h2>
        <p> The purpose for which we collect this information is to assist us in providing you
          with the products and services you have requested. We will not use your personal
          information for any purpose which is not related to the products or services you
          have requested or for any purpose which you would not reasonably expect us to use
          the information. We typically use your information for the following purposes:</p>
        <h3> Registration </h3>
        <p> We request certain personally identifiable information from you on the registration
          form and to enable you to create a user name and password when applicable. We use
          this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have
          expressed interest. </p>
        <h3> Orders </h3>
        <p> If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable
          information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such
          as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit
          card number, expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes and
          to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information
          to contact you.</p>
        <h3> Bulletin boards/chat rooms/blogs/forums </h3>
        <p> Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be
          aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and
          used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information
          from our blog or community forum, <a href="mailto:privacy@nitropdf.com">contact us</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal
          information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
        <h3> Customer testimonials/comments/reviews </h3>
        <p> We post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our web site which may contain
          personally identifiable information. We do obtain the customer's consent via email
          prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.
          If you would like to have us remove any of your comments, please <a href="mailto:privacy@nitropdf.com">contact us</a>.</p>
        <h2> Communications from the site</h2>
        <h3> Special offers and updates </h3>
        <p> We will occasionally send you information on products, services, special offers,
          and promotions. You can sign up for these emails from various pages on our sites.
          Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types
          of communications. Please see the “Choice and Opt-out.” </p>
        <h3> Newsletters </h3>
        <p> If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address
          to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a
          way to unsubscribe. Please see the “Choice and Opt-out” section.</p>
        <h3> Product/service-related announcements </h3>
        <p> We will send you strictly product/service-related announcements on rare occasions
          when it is necessary to do so. For instance, to assist you with product usage or
          notification of product and service maintenance, we might send you an email. </p>
        <p> Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional
          in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you can <a href="mailto:privacy@nitropdf.com">contact us</a>. </p>
        <h3> Customer Service </h3>
        <p> Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send
          you a welcoming email to verify information you provided. We will also communicate
          with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and
          to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance
          with your wishes.</p>
        <h3> Choice/Opt-out </h3>
        <p> We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable
          information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example,
          if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing
          material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form. </p>
        <p> If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications,
          you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each
          newsletter or communication or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@nitropdf.com"> unsubscribe@nitropdf.com</a>. </p>
        <h3> Sharing and disclosure </h3>
        <p> We will share or sell your personal information with third parties only in the ways that
          are described in this privacy statement. We do not sell your personal information to third parties except as described in this privacy policy (see "Business Transitions") </p>
        <p> We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help
          us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer
          service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as
          necessary to provide these services to us. We will not disclose information about
          you to anyone else unless the disclosure:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>is required by law; or </li>
          <li>is authorized by law (for example to protect our interest or where we have a duty
            to the public to disclose that information); or </li>
          <li>has been consented to by you. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Business Transitions </h3>
        <p>In the event Nitro PDF goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred.  You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our Web site for 30 day of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information. </p>
        <h2> Access</h2>
        <p> You may request that we provide you with access to the personal information we hold
          about you at any time. We will respond to your request for access within 30 days.
          If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire
          our service, you may correct, update, delete/remove or deactivate it by making the
          change in your account or by <a href="mailto:privacy@nitropdf.com">emailing us </a> or by contacting us by postal mail at the contact information listed below. Generally
          we will be able to provide you with such access. However, where: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the access impacts on the privacy of others; </li>
          <li>the request for access is frivolous or vexatious; </li>
          <li>there are existing or anticipated legal proceedings </li>
          <li>such access can be denied under law or by law enforcement agency; or </li>
          <li>where the information is evaluative. </li>
        </ul>
        <p> We may not be able to provide you with access to such information. If we deny your
          request for access, we will let you know why. We may also charge a fee to cover
          our reasonable costs associated with your request.</p>
        <h2> Personal information security and data retention </h2>
        <p> We will take all reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from
          loss, misuse or alteration. This includes both physical and technological security
          measures. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal
          information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No
          method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%
          secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. When you
          enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we
          encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology
          (SSL).</p>
        <p> We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed
          to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no
          longer use your information to provide you services <a href="mailto:privacy@nitropdf.com">contact us</a>. We will retain and use your information as necessary
          to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
        <h2> Website </h2>
        <p> We only collect personal information from our website if you submit details to us
          via email or forms on our website. The information collected is limited to your
          email address and the contents of any message you may send to us. Personal information
          collected from our website will only be used for the purpose for which you have
          provided it and it will not be added to a mailing list or used for any other purpose
          without your consent. Our website uses various types of cookies and other tracking
          technologies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Per-session cookies: Used to assess and improve the performance of the web site
            for our users. These cookies are anonymous and in no way no way identify users. </li>
          <li>Persistent cookies: Used to make areas of the site that require a person to be logged
            in easier to use. For example, managing Expert Support enquiries.</li>
          <li>Third Party Cookies: The use of cookies by third parties such as our tracking utility
            company and service providers are not covered by our privacy statement. We do not
            have access or control over these cookies. </li>
        </ul>
        <p> As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store
          it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser
          type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
          stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual
          users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around
          the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We
          do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information</p>
        <h3> Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs) </h3>
        <p> We and our third party advertising partner employ a software technology called clear
          gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site
          by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique
          identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements
          of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard
          drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of
          the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by
          clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</p>
        <p> We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web
          site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies
          and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities
          on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your
          interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving
          you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here: <a href="http://preferences.truste.com"> http://preferences.truste.com/</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of
          being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads. </p>
        <h3> Links to other sites </h3>
        <p> This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by
          Nitro PDF Pty. Ltd. Please be aware that we, Nitro PDF, are not responsible for the

          personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies only to information
          collected by this Web site.</p>
        <h2> Changes to our Privacy Policy </h2>
        <p> We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices.
          If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail
          address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to
          the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page
