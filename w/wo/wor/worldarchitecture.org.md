WA PRIVACY POLICY

World Architecture Community (“WA”, “we”, “us” and “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe our practices regarding the Personal Information (defined below) we collect from users through our website, located at worldarchitecture.org, (“Site”), mobile applications (“Applications”) and services made available through the Site and Applications (collectively “Services”). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given in our WA Member Agreement located at [worldarchitecture.org/svs/html/WA_Member_Agreement.htm](http://worldarchitecture.org/svs/html/WA_Member_Agreement.htm "WA Member Agreement") (the “Terms”).

This Privacy Policy will apply whether you are a “Visitor” (which means that you simply browse the Services) or an “Authorized User” (which means you have registered to use the Services). Visitors and Authorized Users are individually referred to as a “User” and collectively as “Users”.

1.     **User Consent.** By submitting Personal Information through our Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

2.     **A Note to Users in the European Union.** Your Personal Information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including but not limited to the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in the European Union. By using the Services you agree to such processing.

3.     **Types of Information We Collect.** “Personal Information” means information that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing Information. “Anonymous Information” means Information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information. Anonymous Information does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Information and Anonymous Information, as described below through the Services.

a)    **Information You Provide to Us.**

                                      i.     **Registration.** When you register to become an Authorized User and open an account (a “WA Account”), we collect your name, e-mail address, password, year of birth, location country, occupation, education and institution name.

                                     ii.     **SNS Login.** If you prefer, you may logon as an Authorized User by using social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, Google or LinkedIn) (each an “SNS”), in which case we will receive all of the information from the SNS that you authorize us to receive from the SNS.

                                   iii.     **Profile Pages.** The information collected during registration is used to initiate a personal Profile page. You can add to your personal profile by providing your phone and fax numbers, mailing address, education level, interests, social media identification information and the firm and projects with which you are associated. 

                                   iv.     **Office Pages.** If you represent an architectural office, large or small, you may create an Office page in which case we will collect the information provided within the office profile, including the firm name, description, street address, telephone and fax numbers, website URL, social links and descriptions.

                                     v.     **Project Pages.** We encourage our users to share their work, be it built or concept through our Portal. We collect the images and descriptions you provide when you upload a project, whether you chose to participate in one of the cycles of the WA Awards competition, a Project Page is then created on our system, where the information as well as the visuals you upload will be collected on our servers or the servers of third parties working on our behalf.

                                   vi.     **WA Award.** If you participate in one of the cycles of the WA Awards competition, your project you upload will also be listed as participating to the cycle and if your project wins at the WA Award competition, an additional poster will be created by one of WA staff and be stored on our Portal both for your and others to view or download as an image file. Typically, such posters include a visual from your project as well as its name and your name.

                                  vii.     **Postings.** When you post comments or publish news on our portal, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers or the servers of third parties working on our behalf.

                                viii.     **Feedback.** If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.

                                   ix.     **Purchases.** If you choose to make purchases through our Services, including purchasing a subscription to our portal or WA Awards participation voucher, we will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name, e-mail address, and billing information. WA never collects nor stores any information related to your credit cards or bank accounts as all transactions go through PayPal service (paypal.com). Please consult PayPal Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy for information on how they store, handle and secure your information. 

                                     x.     **Other Information.** We may also collect Personal Information in other ways within the Services, where we state that Personal Information is being collected. For example, we may collect Personal Information as part of a survey, competition, sweepstakes or contest.

b)   **Information Collected via Technology.**

                                      i.     **Browser Information.** To make our Site and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) may collect information from you, including your browser type, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), search terms, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.

                                     ii.     **Cookies.** We also use cookies and URL information to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and which you viewed. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Portal. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.

                                   iii.     **Pixel Tags.** We use “Pixel Tags” (also referred to as clear gifs, web beacons, or web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages, in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened. We may use this information to gauge effectiveness of our communication and subsequently reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.

                                   iv.     **Applications.** We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile or tablet device if you download our Application(s) in the future. This information would generally be used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you. Examples of information that may be collected and used could include your geographic location, how you use the Application(s), and information about the type of device you use. In addition, in the event there are technical problems with our Application(s), we will receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which will allow us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our Application(s). This information will be sent to us as aggregated information and is not traceable to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual.

                                     v.     **Collection of Information by Advertisers.** We may also use third parties to serve ads through the Services. Certain third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit our Site. They do this by using Cookies, Pixel Tags or other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Site and the other sites tracked by these third parties. This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, Cookies or Pixel Tags in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of Cookies and other technologies. 

                                   vi.     **Analytic Services.** We may use third party analytics services such as Google Analytics to collect information about how you use and interact with our Site and Services. Such third party analytics services may use cookies to gather information such as the pages you visited, your IP address, a date/time stamp for your visit and which site referred you to the Site. We use these analytics services to help us analyze how people use the Services, to improve the Services, to customize the content users see based upon their interests and to send e-mail to users who are not actively using the Services. For more information about how these entities use this information, please refer to their privacy policies made available on their websites.

                                  vii.     **Information Collected from You About Others.** If you decide to invite a third party to create an Account, we will collect your and the third party’s names and e-mail addresses in order to send an e-mail and follow up with the third party. We rely upon you to obtain whatever consents from the third party that may be required by law to allow us to access and upload the third party’s names and e-mail addresses as required above. You or the third party may contact us at info@worldarchitecture.org to request the removal of this information from our database.

                                viii.     **Information Collected from Third Party Companies.** We may receive Personal and/or Anonymous Information about you from companies that offer their products and/or services on our Site. These third party companies may supply us with Personal Information. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Site in order to improve the Services we provide.

5.     **Disclosure of Your Personal Information.** We disclose your Personal Information as described below and as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.

a)    **Profiles and Projects.** Connecting people, firms and projects is an essential element of the Services. As such, personal profiles, office profiles and projects are made publicly available within the Services, with the understanding that within your personal profile, we do not make your e-mail and mailing address, phone or fax number, social links or website URL publicly available, unless you expressly make them available on your personal Profile Settings page. In addition, you may make comments or post material in other public areas of the Services. Once displayed on publicly viewable web pages, please be aware that the information can be collected and used by others. We cannot control who reads your profile, projects or posts, so please be thoughtful about the information you make publicly available within the Services. Once information is posted publicly, while you will still be able to edit and delete it within the Services, you will not be able to edit or delete such information cached, collected, and stored elsewhere by others (e.g., search engines).

6.     **Third Party Websites.** When you click on a link to any other website or location, you will leave our Services and go to another site and another entity may collect Personal Information or Anonymous Information from you. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites or content or to any collection of Information after you click on links to connect to such outside websites.

7.     **Our Relationship with Social Networking Sites (SNS).** As noted above, we offer you interfaces that allow you to connect to your WA Account by using account and an SNS (e.g., Facebook, Google and LinkedIn). We will work with the SNS’s application protocol interface (better known as their developer API) in a way that allows you to authorize us to access your account on that SNS on your behalf. In order to provide this authorization, you will not provide us with your user name or password to the SNS, but you will need to log-in to that SNS directly through our Site. Once authorized by you, the SNS will provide us a token that allows the SNS to recognize us when we ask, on your behalf, for access to your account. You will be able to revoke our access to any SN Site at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable SNS, though such revocation may limit the Services we are able to provide you.

**8.     ****Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information.**

a)    **Newsletters and e-mail.** We will periodically send you newsletters and e-mails that promote the use of our Services. When you receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive, by terminating your WA Account or by contacting us directly (please see contact information below). You may also limit the communications you receive from us through your Profile Settings page within the Services. Even if you opt out of receiving marketing related messages, we will continue to send messages regarding the administration of the Services.

b)   **Changes to Personal Information.** Except for your e-mail, username or password, you may change any of your Personal Information in your WA Account (including the Office profile and the Project pages connected to your WA Account) by editing your profile or by sending an e-mail to us at the e-mail address set forth below. You may request deletion of your Personal Information by us, but please note that we may be required to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). Additionally, it is important to note that system-recorded personal information is not editable. When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives. We may retain your information for fraud prevention or similar purposes.

9.     **Security of Your Personal Information.** WA is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Information. We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We also require you to enter a password to access your WA Account information. Please do not disclose your WA Account password to unauthorized people. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while WA uses reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Information, WA cannot guarantee its absolute security.

10. **Contact Information.** WA welcomes your comments or questions regarding this Privacy Policy. Please e-mail us at info@worldarchitecture.org.

11. **Changes to this Privacy Policy.** This Privacy Policy is subject to occasional revision, and if we make any material changes in the way we use your Personal Information, we will notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us and/or prominently posting notice of the changes on our Services.

If you do not wish to permit changes in our use of your Personal Information, you must notify us prior to the effective date of the changes that you wish to deactivate your WA Account with us. Continued use of our Services, following notice of such changes will indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes. **Please note that at all times you are responsible for updating your Personal Information to provide us with your most current e-mail address.** In the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail explaining the changes will be effective notice.
