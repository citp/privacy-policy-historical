### Use of cookies

A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive.

We can also allow ad companies to use cookies to help serve advertisments. They are just used to help serve ads on the site you are visiting. Cookies cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines, so advertisers will not know who you are. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that use if you desire.
