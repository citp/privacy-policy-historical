                        </p>
                        <p> The Site’s various mailing lists, downloads, special offers, contests, registration forms, and surveys may request that you give us contact information such as your name, mailing and/or e-mail address, demographic information such as your age and gender, and personal preference information such as your preferred software and interests.

                        <p>  The Company nonetheless encourages parents to go online with their kids. Here are a few tips to help make a child’s online experience safer:
                        </p>
                        <p>  Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult. Includes name, address, phone, school, etc.
                        Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate.
                        Look for Website privacy policies. Know how your child’s information is treated.
