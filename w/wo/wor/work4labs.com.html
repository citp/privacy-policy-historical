<h1 class="centered title--spacing-bottom">Privacy Policy</h1>

<article id="post-6654" class="post-6654 page type-page status-publish hentry">
<h2>Work4 Privacy Policy</h2>
This Privacy Policy describes the types of personal and non-personal information collected by Work4 Labs, Inc. (“Work4,” “We” or “us”) through our websites and services, including the Work4 website located at <a href="http://www.work4labs.com">www.work4labs.com</a> and its mobile optimized versions, and applications and services we make available through social network platforms (collectively, the “Work4 Service”). This Privacy Policy also describes how we use such information and to whom and under what circumstances we may disclose it. By using the Work4 Service, you agree to the collection, use and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
<h2 class="title--spacing-page">U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Statement</h2>
Work4 complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework
as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention
of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Work4 has
certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer,
security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program,
and to view Work4’s certification, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>
<h2 class="title--spacing-page">Information Collection</h2>
<h3 class="page--spacing-top">Information You Provide To Us</h3>
We collect personal information from you when you provide it to us, such as when you submit
information related to a job posting or post on our blog. Personal information is information that
can be associated with a specific person and could be used to identify that person, but does not
include information anonymized to mask the identity of a specific person. Personal information
may include your name, email address, and other information that identifies you personally
which you elect to provide to us through the Work4 Service.
Our website offers a publicly accessible blog that allows users to post information. You should
be aware that any information you provide through our blog may be read, collected, and used by
others who access the blog.
From time to time, we post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our websites which may
contain personal information. We obtain the customer’s consent via email prior to posting the
testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.
<h3 class="page--spacing-top">Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
When you use the Work4 Service, we collect certain non-personally identifiable information
from you, which may include but is not limited to your browser type, operating system, IP
address, device type, device ID, Internet service provider, the date and time you access the
Work4 Service, geo-location information, the types of jobs and/or employers you’ve reviewed,
the amount of time you spend using the Work4 Service, the number of times you return to the
Work4 Service and other clickstream information.
We (or service providers used in providing the Work4 Service) may use cookies and web
beacons (also called “pixel tags” or “clear gifs”) to collect non-personally identifiable
information. A cookie is a small text file that may be stored on the hard drive of your device
when you access the Work4 Service. A web beacon is a tiny graphic image that we place on the
Work4 Service, in our emails and in the advertisements we place on other websites.
Our websites include social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button. These features
may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to
enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a
third party or hosted directly on our websites. Your interactions with these features are governed
by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
Currently, we do not respond to “Do Not Track” browser features, but we may do so in the future
as industry standards evolve.
<h2 class="title--spacing-page">Information Use</h2>
We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes
without your explicit consent. We may use your personal information to contact you, but if you
do not wish to receive communications from us, you can opt out of receiving them through opt-
out mechanisms included in those communications.
We or service providers working on our behalf may use the information we collect from and
about you for any of the following purposes: (1) to communicate with you regarding your use of
the Work4 Service; (2) to fulfill your requests for information; (3) to respond to your inquiries;
(4) to contact you when necessary; (5) to review Work4 Service usage and operations and
conduct internal marketing and operational research; (6) to address problems with the Work4
Service, our business or our products and services; (7) to protect the security or integrity of the
Work4 Service and our business, including detecting and addressing fraud and abuse; and (8) to
otherwise operate, maintain and provide the features and functionality of the Work4 Service.
Third-party service providers may use cookies and web beacons to deliver Work4 content
and advertising, gather non-personally identifiable data and to perform analytics. We do not
permit any of these service providers to collect any of your personal information through the
Work4 Service. These service providers may use this non-personally identifiable information,
together with anonymous information about you that they receive from others, to deliver targeted
advertisements to you when you are on one or more of the other websites where they deliver
targeted advertisements.
<h2 class="title--spacing-page">Information Disclosure</h2>
We may share the information we collect from and about you with third parties as described
above, at your direction, and in the following instances:
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li>To employers which have posted jobs for which you’ve expressed an interest or requested additional information;</li>
<li>To our parent and subsidiary companies to provide the Work4 Service;</li>
<li>As necessary, if we believe that there has been a violation of our terms for the Work4 Service or of our rights or the rights of any third party;</li>
<li>As necessary, to identify, investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud or other abuse of the Work4 Services;</li>
<li>To respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law; and</li>
<li>In the event that Work4 goes through a business transaction, such as a merger, an acquisition by another company, or a sale of all or a portion of its assets, your information may be one of the transferred assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="title--spacing-page">Links</h2>
The Work4 Service may provide links to third-party websites for your convenience and
information. If you access those links, you will leave the Work4 website. Work4 does not control
those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from Work4’s. We do not endorse or
make any representations about third-party websites. The personal data you choose to give to
unrelated third parties is not covered by the Work4 Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review
the privacy policy or any company before submitting your personal information. Some third-
party companies may choose to share their personal data with Work4; that sharing is governed
by that third-party company’s privacy policy.
<h2 class="title--spacing-page">Children</h2>
We do not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under
13 years of age, and no part of the Work4 Service is directed to persons under 13. If we learn
that personally identifiable information of persons less than 13 years of age has been collected
without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete such
information.
<h2 class="title--spacing-page">Security</h2>
Work4 takes appropriate steps to ensure data privacy and security through various hardware and
software methodologies. However, we cannot ensure or warrant against all risks with regards to
the security of that information, so information you choose to transmit to Work4 and which we
store is provided to us at your own risk, and Work4 does not guarantee that such information
may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our safeguards. In
addition other Internet sites or services that may be accessible through Work4 have separate data
and privacy practices independent of us, and therefore we disclaim any responsibility or liability
for their security features, policies or actions.
<h2 class="title--spacing-page">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we will post the changes on our
website at www.work4labs.com and update the date of this Privacy Policy.
<h2 class="title--spacing-page">Contact Us</h2>
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, or if you want to remove any
information you’ve posted in our blog or desire that we delete any testimonial, please contact us
at: <a href="mailto:privacy@work4labs.com">privacy@work4labs.com</a>.
If you have any complaints regarding our compliance with the Safe Harbor Frameworks, you must first
contact us at privacy@work4labs.com. Work4 will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and
disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information. &nbsp;For complaints that cannot be
resolved between Work4 and the complainant, Work4 will cooperate with JAMS pursuant to the JAMS
International Mediation Rules<a href="https://www.work4labs.com/resources/blog/">.</a>
