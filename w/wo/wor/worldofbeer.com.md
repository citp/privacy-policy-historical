# World of Beer - Privacy Policy

Effective Date: May 19, 2017

World of Beer Franchising, Inc. ("WOB," "we," "us," or "our") takes seriously the confidentiality of your personal information. This Privacy Policy describes the information collected through this web site and the mobile applications that we provide (together, "Site") and how that information is used and shared. WOB and its suppliers may collect or receive the types of information described below in connection with your access to and use of the Site (together, "Collected Information").

**BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, ACCESSING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE SITE, OR BY ACCEPTING OUR WOB REWARDS TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THAT YOU CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION, USE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION AS DISCUSSED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITE OR ANY PORTION OF THE SITE.**

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and made a part of our Terms of Use, our WOB Rewards Terms and Conditions, and any end user license or similar agreement pertaining to any mobile application that WOB provides. We may modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time, which changes will be effective immediately upon their posting on the Site. Material changes will be posted conspicuously on the Site. 

If you are visiting the Site from outside the United States, please be aware that Collected Information may be transferred to, stored in, and processed in the United States (where our and our suppliers' servers and databases are located and operated). The data protection and related laws and regulations of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in the country from which you are accessing the Site. If you do not consent to this transfer, do not accept this privacy policy or otherwise use the website.

WOB is the exclusive owner of all Collected Information. In the event of a change in control or reorganization of WOB or sale by WOB of substantially all of its assets, Collected Information may be transferred or sold to such WOB successor. That successor will be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy as it applies to that Collected Information.

**Personally Identifiable Information**

You may visit the Site without disclosing any personally identifiable information, but you will be required to provide personally identifiable information in order to use certain Site features, such as requesting to receive our email newsletter, registering with the Site to receive email notifications for WOB locations, purchasing a gift card, requesting to receive more information about franchising opportunities, or joining the WOB rewards program.

WOB will collect any personally identifiable information from or about you that you provide to us, which information may include your name, contact information (including your telephone number, physical address, and email address), shipping information, payment information, and your birthdate. You may choose to submit additional information, which we will collect if you choose to provide it. If you provide your wireless or other telephone number to us, we will use that telephone number to look up your WOB rewards account, if applicable. We will use your personally identifiable information to communicate with you and as otherwise set forth below, subject to applicable laws.

### Mailing List Information

If you sign up or otherwise opt in to receive emailed promotions from us, you will need to submit your name, email address, and birthdate. You must be at least 21 years of age in order to sign up for our mailing lists. We will use this information to provide you with promotional and other communications that we think may be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from us at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions contained in the applicable email. We may use a third party email provider to deliver these communications to you.

### Rewards Program

If you sign up for the WOB rewards program you will need to submit your name, physical address, email address, telephone number, and birthdate. To register your physical WOB rewards program card on the Site, you will need to enter the loyalty card number located on that card.

If you use the Site while logged into your WOB rewards program account or if you use your WOB rewards program membership at a WOB location, we will collect information about your activity and transactions, for example, the beers you have purchased and the WOB locations you have visited.

### Payment Information

Purchases of gift cards must be made by credit or debit card. All credit and debit card information is provided directly to our PCI-compliant third-party payment processor. WOB does not directly access or handle your credit or debit card information. To make a purchase, you will need to submit your name, email address, and telephone number, as well as your credit or debit card number, expiration date, CVV code, and billing address. Payment by credit or debit card is subject to the approval of the card issuer. We will not be liable in any way if a card issuer refuses to accept a credit or debit card for any reason. We do not store or maintain any credit or debit card information.

### Franchise Inquiries

If you fill out an inquiry form on the Site with respect to WOB franchising opportunities, you will need to submit various information pertaining to the prospective franchisee, such as whether or not you have franchising experience, your areas of interest, and limited company financial information.

When you browse our website, you are able to do so anonymously. However, we may passively collect anonymous information when you are on our website.

### Advertising Networks and Personalized Advertising

The Site uses Google AdWords, an online advertising service provided by Google Inc., to collects anonymous information about your visits to and interactions with the Site and other web sites. Google Inc. will use this information to target advertisements for goods and services. These targeted advertisements may appear on the Site or on other web sites. The anonymous information is collected through the use of a "pixel tag," which is industry-standard technology. To opt out of remarketing advertising provided through Google or to customize your ad preferences, visit Google's Ad Settings page at http://www.google.com/settings/ads. Opting out will not affect your use of the Site.

Opting out of online ads with one ad network and web browser does not necessarily carry over to any other ad network or web browser. As a result, depending on the opt-outs you request, you may still see our ads from time to time.

These features may require us to implement cookies, plug-ins, and application protocol interfaces (APIs) provided by those social media platforms.

### Sharing Collected Information with Other Third Parties

We may share Collected Information with third parties who have products or services that we think may be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving communications from any such third party pursuant to such third party's policies. We do not control any third party or their policies.

The Site has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will not occur, WOB uses industry standards, such as Secure Socket Layers ("SSL") technology, to help safeguard against such occurrences. In certain areas, the information passed between your browser and our system is encrypted with SSL technology to create a protected connection between you and our website to ensure confidentiality. The storage and communication of information can never be completely secure, so we do not guarantee that communications or other information that you submit or that are otherwise provided to us will be completely secure.
