# Privacy Policy

### [Download](https://cdn.worldnomads.net/Media/Default/PDFS/WorldNomads_privacy_policy.pdf) the full World Nomads Privacy Policy

At World Nomads, we understand that privacy is really important. So we have prepared this privacy policy to fill you in on what personal information we may collect, how we collect it and what we do with it.

World Nomads is committed to protecting your privacy in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).

This policy describes our current policies and practices in relation to the management of your personal information.

### What personal and sensitive information do we collect and hold?

There are situations in which we ask you to give us personal information about yourself. This information includes things like your name, age, gender, contact details, employment history, bank account and credit card details, and, if applicable, any information we receive through our complaints process. The sensitive information we may collect may include health information, such as information about your medical conditions and treatment. If customers choose to purchase World Nomads travel insurance, we collect their credit card details and other identifying information in order to process orders and provide customer service.

### How do we collect and hold your personal and sensitive information?

We collect your personal and sensitive information in various ways.

These include when you:

  * submit an enquiry through our website or request information from us
  * enter into any competitions, scholarships or promotions we may run
  * sign up for a Journal with us
  * join our Ask a Nomad community
  * submit an application for insurance or make a claim
  * download a PDF guide
  * Your personal information may also be collected when you browse our website (or associated websites), use our mobile apps or when you speak with us by telephone or through social media networks.



Information from other sources

In most circumstances we will only collect your personal and sensitive information from you, unless it is unreasonable or impracticable to do so, and will only collect your sensitive information with your consent, unless we are legally required or authorised to do otherwise. We may also collect your personal or sensitive information from third parties including those authorised by you such as your family members, travelling companions, doctors, hospitals and medical service providers, as well as from others we consider necessary including our service providers, partners, associates, those who investigate and manage claims, and government entities.

Information about other people

When you give us personal and/or sensitive information about other individuals, we and our agents rely on you to have made or make that individual aware of the matters contained in our Privacy Notice, including:

• that you will or may provide their information to us, and how to contact us;

• of the types of third parties to whom the information may be provided;

• of the relevant purposes for which we and the third parties will collect, use and disclose it;

• that we have a privacy policy and where this is located; and

• how they can request access and correct their information, or make a complaint.

We rely on you to have obtained their consent on these matters. If you have not done or will not do these things, you must tell us or our agents before you provide the relevant information.

Security

We strive to protect the privacy and security of the personal and sensitive information we hold through the use of encryption, security access, firewalls and computer security systems. We have physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal and sensitive information which is held by us, and access to information stored electronically is restricted to staff whose positions require access to this. We may also use third party data storage providers and servers to store your personal information.

We use the very latest, industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. This technology encrypts the information about you that is entered on our website, prevents other computers impersonating your computer and prevents third parties reading or changing your information as it travels over the internet.

Mobile Applications

When you use our mobile apps, certain details about your travel insurance policy (such as your name, age, destination and travel dates) are retrieved from our servers and stored locally on your mobile device. We also collect your personal information when you submit an application for travel insurance through the app. Any personal information we collect through the app is not stored on the device or within the app itself but is transmitted to our servers using SSL technology.

We will only hold your personal information for as long as necessary for any purpose for which it may be used or disclosed, or to comply with any legal or ethical reporting or retention requirements. Where personal information is no longer needed by us for any purpose and as soon as the law permits, we will use secure methods to destroy or de-identify that information.

### For what purposes do we collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information?

We collect personal information and, in certain circumstances, sensitive information from you and others to enable us to provide you with a quote and to arrange and manage your travel insurance and insurance related services.

Any personal information you provide is used by us to evaluate and arrange your travel insurance. We also use it to administer and provide the insurance related services. These include providing you with emergency assistance, managing, processing and investigating claims as well as managing your and our rights and obligations in relation to the insurance. We may also collect, use and disclose it for product development, marketing, competitions, research, IT systems maintenance and development, recovery against third parties and for any other purposes with your consent or where authorised by law.

Some examples of the purposes for which we use your information include:

  * obtaining, responding to and managing feedback from travellers
  * processing purchase orders and providing technical support
  * contacting travellers with information and updates (like exciting travel news, great offers, promotions, special events, competitions and surveys) from World Nomads. Our information and updates may also include information from our partners.
  * managing our competitions and scholarships and contacting the winners
  * personalising or improving the way World Nomads content is presented to you across a range of platforms (see our "Cookies Policy" below for more information)



Use of the description and outcome of your claim

If you provide your consent when lodging a claim, we may use a description of your claim, along with your first name, last initial, country of residence, country of loss and the outcome of your claim for marketing purposes. If you do not provide your consent, this information may be used anonymously for marketing purposes.

In regards to our communications with you

If you have shared your information (such as your email address) with World Nomads, for instance by purchasing a policy from us, submitting an enquiry on our website or otherwise interacting with us, we may occasionally notify you by email or other methods such as by phone or SMS about our services, products, special offers, contests, events or articles we think will be of interest to you. If you would rather not receive this information, you can opt out by using the unsubscribe facility included in all our marketing correspondence, or by contacting us directly.

Once you have provided us with your information, sleep easy, we will not sell your email address or phone number to marketing companies for spamming (but we will disclose your email address to the organisation which helps us provide the email service). World Nomads collects your email address so we can send you email newsletters as well as emails for all your travel inspiration, tips and exclusive offers. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link in the footer of the emails. 

### Will we disclose the information we collect to anyone?

Your personal and sensitive information may be disclosed to third parties in Australia or overseas involved in the above processes, such as:

  * travel agents, consultants and travel insurance providers;
  * your and our agents, insurance intermediaries, and our representatives;
  * insurers and reinsurers;
  * claims handlers, investigators, and cost containment providers;
  * service providers and contractors, including IT service providers and medical and health service providers;
  * legal and other professional advisers;
  * law enforcement, regulatory and government entities and courts where we are legally required or authorised to do so;
  * our related companies; and

Some of the parties referred to above may be located in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States of America. There may be certain circumstances that require disclosure of your personal and sensitive information to other countries in order for us to be able to provide insurance related services to you.

### How you can access the personal information that we hold about you, and seek correction of such information

You can seek access to and request correction of your personal and sensitive information held by us by sending us a written request and enough information to allow us to identify the information. You may not access or correct personal or sensitive information of others unless you have been authorised by them or otherwise under law, or unless they are your dependants under 16 years. In cases where we do not agree to give you access to or to correct your personal information, we will give you reasons why.

We do not charge you for making a request to access or correct your personal information, however we may charge an administration fee for providing you with access to your personal and sensitive information.

### Circumstances where you can deal with us anonymously or using a pseudonym

Where possible, you have the option of not identifying yourself or using a pseudonym when you deal with us. For example, you can make general enquiries on our website, call us to ask questions about the products we offer, or obtain a basic indicative quote without identifying yourself or by using a pseudonym. However, we require you to provide us with your personal information in order for us to process your application for, and to provide you with, our products and services.
