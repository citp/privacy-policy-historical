Your Personal Information is stored on WorstPreviews.com computer servers located in the United States.<br><br>

We may gather data about the areas of WorstPreviews.com you visit or access. We do not use any of this navigational data about where you "as an individual user" go on WorstPreviews.com or share any of this data with third parties. However, we do use and share navigational data in aggregate, non-personal form to understand how users, as a group, use and navigate WorstPreview.com.<br><br>

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information in public areas of WorstPreviews.com, such as the member home pages, your information can be viewed and possibly used by others. We advise users to be especially careful in such public areas about disclosing Personal Information, such as full name, home address, credit card information or phone number.<br><br>

Below are more details about the Personal Information we, or third parties may gather from you and how we may use it.<br><br>

<b>B. Membership Information.</b> When you register for a membership at WorstPreviews.com, we will ask you for certain minimum required information, such as your name, birth date, gender, email address and zip code. We may also ask for additional information about you and your interests. We do this so we can better understand your preferences and tailor WorstPreviews.com to suit you better. The more information you volunteer, the more we can tailor the WorstPreviews.com Site and promotions to your interests. Additionally, third party service providers may require you to assent to their privacy policy as a condition to receiving their service.<br><br>

We also use some of the Personal Information that you provide in these surveys to help us understand your interests and to make WorstPreviews.com more useful to you.<br><br>
