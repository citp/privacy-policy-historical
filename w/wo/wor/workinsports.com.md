Work In Sports, LLC (“WorkInSports.com”) is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the site www.WorkInSports.com. Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. 

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Robert Oakley at [privacy@WorkInSports.com](mailto:privacy@WorkInSports.com). If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe at <http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php>.

**Dedicated to your privacy**

Your privacy is important to us. Our goal is to earn and keep your trust, according to the following principles: 

  * We will never rent or sell your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes 
  * We will never share your contact information with a recruiter or hiring manager, unless both of you choose to contact one another regarding an open position 
  * Any sensitive information that you provide will be secured with all industry standard protocols and technology 



When this Privacy Policy uses the term "personally identifiable information" or "personal information," we mean information that identifies a particular individual, such as your full name, street address or email address. When other information, such as your target job category, is associated with personal information, it also becomes personally identifiable information for the purposes of this privacy policy. 

Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about the ways in which we use and protect your personal information. 

**Information We Collect and How We Use That Information**

Registration  
Our basic registration forms require users to provide contact information, including name, mailing address and email address. We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest. Should you choose to purchase services, your credit card information will be stored. We use this information for billing purposes only. If we have trouble processing your order, we will use your information to contact you. 

We will use your Personal Information for internal purposes only and will never sell or share your personal information with any third parties except as described in this privacy statement (see “Business Transitions”). Sensitive information such as your credit card information will be kept completely private and encrypted during collection and transmission to our credit card processors (see “Security”). 

Resume  
Should you post your resume, the amount of information you choose to keep confidential is entirely up to your discretion. You may enter as much or as little information as you choose. If you do not wish to reveal your contact information to hiring authorities, you may still post your resume as Confidential. All information posted will only be visible to recruiters and companies seeking employees. All recruiters are screened and have been determined by WorkInSports.com to be legitimately seeking applicants for open positions. 

Refer-A-Friend  
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friends name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. WorkInSports.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. 

Your friend may contact [Customer Support](https://web.archive.org/web/20080914134522id_/http%3A//www.workinsports.com/wiscontactus.asp) to request that we remove this information from our database. 

Target Job Information  
We also use Personal Information to provide you with targeted job information. For example, your email job alert will contain job information based on the job locations and categories you choose. 

Service Providers  
We use third parties to provide credit card processing services on our site. If you purchase service, we will share your personal information with this service provider to bill you for the services purchased. This service provider will only use your information to provide the services requested and will not use your information for any other purpose including their own marketing. This process is highly secure. 

Testimonials  
We post consumer testimonials on our Site. All testimonials in which Personal Information is included are always consented to prior to posting.

As a registered user of WorkInSports.com, you will automatically receive our service announcements (e.g., email address confirmation, signup confirmation, administrative messages, etc.) at your email address. Service announcements are required as they may contain information vital to your account; you may not unsubscribe from service announcements unless you deactivate your account. 

Job Alerts, Career Event Notification and Promotional are permission-based emails that will only be sent to you if you either opt-in at time of registration or turn them on in your account. You can update your email preferences by logging onto your “Account Settings” page. In addition, each permission-based email communication from us contains an unsubscribe link in the footer you can click to be instantly removed from that program. 

**Choice/Opt-out**

You can update your email preferences by logging onto your “Account Settings” page on the Site. In addition, each subscription-based email communication from us contains an unsubscribe link in the footer you can click to instantly remove yourself from the mailing list for that specific email subscription program.

**Cookies**

As is true of most Web sites, we may use cookies to enhance your experience on WorkInSports.com. Cookies are pieces of information that some Web sites transfer to the computer that is browsing that Web site and are used for record-keeping purposes. Use of cookies makes Web-surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving your passwords and your personal preferences regarding your use of the particular Web site. We do link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. Many consider the use of cookies to be an industry standard. 

Your browser is probably set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, our Web site may not function properly. 

**Log Files**

Again, like most standard Web sites, we use and maintain the information that we obtain from your browser on our server logs. This information can include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider ("ISP"), and other data. We may use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may associate this information with your Personal Information to resolve technical issues and support security for our users. 

**Web Beacons**

A web beacon (also known as a clear gif) is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier that is placed on a web page or within an email. It is similar in function to a cookie, and is used to collect a limited set of information, such as a cookie number, time and date of page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides. WorkInSports.com uses web beacons to compile aggregate statistics about which advertisements and promotions users have seen and how users responded to them. This information helps us better manage content on the Site by informing us what content is effective. In addition, we may use web beacons in our e-mail messages to count how many messages and which emails have been opened and acted upon. This use allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and our marketing campaigns. WorkInSports.com does associate web beacons to individual member personal information for internal purposes only, in an effort to understand our members’ individual preferences with our email products. 

**Security**

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). 

WorkInSports.com has implemented and follows industry standard measures to protect against unauthorized access to and unlawful interception or processing of Personal Information. We also protect account information by placing it on a secure portion of our Web site that is only accessible by certain qualified employees of WorkInSports.com. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warranty the security of any such Personal Information. 

**Links to Other Sites**

WorkInSports.com contains links to other Web sites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are entering another website over which we have no control and will bear no responsibility. Often these sites require you to enter your personal information as you apply for a job directly with the hiring company. We encourage you to read the privacy statements on all such Web sites as their policies may differ from ours. 

**Business Transitions**

In the event WorkinSports.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information. 

**Access to Personally Identifiable Information**

If your personally identifiable information or email changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by making the change on your “Account Settings” page or by contacting [Customer Support](https://web.archive.org/web/20080914134522id_/http%3A//www.workinsports.com/wiscontactus.asp). 

**Legal Disclaimer**

We may disclose your Personal Information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on WorkInSports.com. 

As such, we cannot ensure that your Personal Information will not be disclosed to third parties when compelled by law or to comply with legal process. For example, we may be legally obligated to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. 

**Changes in this Privacy Statement**

If we decide to change our privacy policy or email practices, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
