It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. 

**Dedicated to your privacy**

Your privacy is important to us. Our goal is to earn and keep your trust, according to the following principles: 

  * We will never rent or sell your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes 
  * We will never share your contact information with a recruiter or hiring manager, unless both of you choose to contact one another regarding an open position 
  * Any sensitive information that you provide will be secured with all industry standard protocols and technology 



If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, [contact us here](https://web.archive.org/wiscontactus.asp).

When this Privacy Policy uses the term "personally identifiable information" or "personal information," we mean information that identifies a particular individual, such as your full name, street address or email address. When other information, such as your target job category, is associated with personal information, it also becomes personally identifiable information for the purposes of this privacy policy. 

Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about the ways in which we use and protect your personal information. 

**Information We Collect and How We Use That Information**

Sensitive information such as your credit card information will be kept completely private and encrypted during collection and transmission to our credit card processors (see ï¿½Securityï¿½). 

Resume  
Should you post your resume, the amount of information you choose to keep confidential is entirely up to your discretion. You may enter as much or as little information as you choose. If you do not wish to reveal your contact information to hiring authorities, you may still post your resume as Confidential. All information posted will only be visible to recruiters and companies seeking employees. All recruiters are screened and have been determined by WorkInSports.com to be legitimately seeking applicants for open positions.
