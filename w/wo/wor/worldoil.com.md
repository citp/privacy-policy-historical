**5\. Cookies and similar technologies**

All our Sites use cookies and similar technical tools to collect information about your access to the Site and the services we provide.

Cookies are pieces of information which include a unique reference code that a website transfers to your device to store and sometimes track information about you. A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web session and expire when you close your browser. Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to the Site and will last for longer. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. They are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie.

We may use cookies to meet our business interests in understanding how people use our Sites, carrying out advertising and providing services you request to:

  * remember that you have used the Site before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive to different parts of the Site. This allows us to make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get and make sure that the Site runs fast enough;
  * remember your login session so you can move from one page to another within the Site;
  * store your preferences or your user name and password so that you do not need to input these every time you visit the Site;
  * customize elements of the layout and/or content of the pages of Site for you;
  * record activity on our Sites so that we understand how you use our Sites enabling us to better tailor our content, services and marketing to your needs;
  * collect statistical information about how you use the Site so that we can improve the Site; and
  * use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) or other first-party identifiers, and third-party cookies (such as Google advertising cookies) or other third-party identifiers together to target relevant ads to you on external sites using AdWords and DoubleClick Bid Manager; and
  * gather information about the pages on the Site that you visit, and also other information about other websites that you visit, so as to place you in a “market segment”. This information is only collected by reference to the IP address that you are using, but does include information about the county and city you are in, together with the name of your internet service provider. This information is then used to place interest-based advertisements on the Site which it is believed will be relevant to your market segment.

**Email tracking:**  So that we can better understand our users` needs, we track responses to our emails - for example, to see which links are the most popular in newsletters, and to log and follow up responses to our marketing messages. To do this, we use pixel GIFs, also known as "pixel tags" - these are small image files that are placed within the body of our email messages. They enable us to tell if a message has been opened and to track click-throughs on links within the message. 

Any other purposes for which Gulf Publishing Holdings LLC wishes to use your personal data will be notified to you and your personal data will not be used for any such purpose without obtaining your prior consent.
