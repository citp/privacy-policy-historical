        	<p>In order to participate in World Community Grid you will be required to install on your computer software from IBM or a third party (“Required Software”).  The Required Software automatically detects certain basic information from a Member's machine, such as information about the Member's device specifics, IP address and set preferences regarding disk space, memory and times to run the research projects on the device.</p>
        	<p>World Community Grid may utilize aggregate member information such as average computing power and geographic dispersion. The information will be utilized in aggregate form only and, no personally identifiable information will ever be utilized, unless with member consent. World Community Grid will not access any other information on a Member device or identify anything else for which a member uses his or her device.</p>
        	<p>World Community Grid may request permission to utilize personally identifiable information for special events or promotions.  If you provide permission, you give us and affiliated companies and our suppliers and others who are working on or with World Community Grid permission to use that information worldwide in connection with World Community Grid.  </p>

        	<p>The World Community Grid privacy statement shall apply to your e-mail address and password, insofar as you do not make such information part of your profile or disclose it elsewhere on the World Community Grid site.  It shall not apply to User Content that you post or provide.  “User Content” includes all information, profiles, personal information, contact data, submissions, ideas, tags, messages, recommendations, text, material, articles, photos, music, videos, posts, comments, responses, e-mail and other content that you post on the World Community Grid site.

        	<p>IBM is a global organization with business processes, management structures and technical systems that cross borders. As such, we may share information about you within IBM and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business in connection with the uses identified above and in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Our Privacy Statement and our practices are designed to provide a globally consistent level of protection for personal information all over the world. This means that even in countries whose laws provide for less protection for your information, IBM will still handle your information in the manner described here. </p>
        	<p>In some cases, IBM uses suppliers located in various countries to collect, use, analyze, and otherwise process information on its behalf. It is IBM's practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with IBM's policies. </p>
        	<p>Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, IBM may decide to transfer World Community Grid to a third party.  Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers. It is IBM’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions. Please be aware that in certain circumstances, personal information may be subject to disclosure to government agencies pursuant to judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process. We may also share your information to protect the rights or property of IBM and others when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such rights or property have been or could be affected. </p>

        	<p>As mentioned above, we collect information from your visits to our Web site to help us gather statistics about usage and effectiveness, personalize your experience, and tailor our interactions with you. We do so through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your device as a tag that identifies your device. While cookies are often only used to measure Web site usage (such as number of visitors and duration of visit) and effectiveness (such as topics visitors are most interested in) and to allow for ease of navigation or use and, as such, are not associated with any personal information, they are also used at times to personalize a known visitor's experience to a Web site by being associated with profile information or user preferences. Over time this information provides valuable insight to help improve the user experience. </p>
        	<p>Cookies are typically categorized as "session" cookies or "persistent" cookies. Session cookies help you navigate through the Web site efficiently, keeping track of your progression from page to page so that you are not asked for information you have already provided during the current visit. Session cookies are stored in temporary memory and erased when the web browser is closed. Persistent cookies, on the other hand, store user preferences for current and successive visits. They are written on your device's hard disk, and are still valid when you restart your browser. We use persistent cookies, for example, to record your choice of language and country location. </p>
        	<p>You can generally express your privacy preferences regarding the use of most cookies and similar technologies though your web browser. Look under the heading "Tools" (or similar heading) in your particular browser for information about controlling cookies. You can set your browser in most instances to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it or not. You can also generally set your browser to turn off cookies. Since cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our Web sites' features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. If you block, turn off or otherwise reject our cookies, some Web pages may not display properly or you will not be able to use any Web site services that require you to log in.</p>
        	<p>We utilize Google Analytics in order to understand how users arrive at and interact with our Web site.  This allows us to measure and thereby improve the Web site for our participants.  Using Google Analytics, we anonymously collect basic information such as the type of browser or operating system you are using.  We also collect information about the order in which you view different pages on our Web site and your use of our Web site on different devices so that we understand your entire experience while visiting our Web site.  You may opt-out of us collecting information about you through Google Analytics by clicking <a data-opt-out="1" href="">here</a>.   You will need to do this for each browser you use to access our website.  Should you delete or clear this cookies on your browser, then you will need to opt-out again by clicking <a data-opt-out="1" href="">here</a>.  </p>
        	<p>We may also include Web beacons in marketing e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and links contained within clicked on. </p>
