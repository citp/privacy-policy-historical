**Worldstuffer Safety Tips**  
One of the best ways to avoid becoming a victim of fraud is to make sure that all deals take place locally and in-person.

You should take the following recommendations:   
• When buying or selling, you should meet in-person to see the product and exchange funds.   
• Do not ever send or wire money to sellers. Do not ever send a cheque or use payment services (e.g. Western Union, Bidpay or Money Gram) to pay for items found on Worldstuffer.   
• Worldstuffer does not offer any sort of buyer protection programs or secure payment systems. If you receive any emails promoting these services, please contact us.   
• Do not ever provide your financial or banking information to others over the Internet.   
• In case of fraud, inform police and contact us.

**Common scams and fraud:**  
• You may get an email as if from Worldstuffer, Western Union or another company claiming those sites offer buyer protection or online payment systems. They usually ask for money transfer using this site or provide personal information. Worldstuffer never send out such emails and if you send money relying on this email, you most likely sending money to the scammers.   
• You may receive a cheque and then ask for money to be returned to them. Often the cheque could be rejected and you lose any money you sent.  
• A seller claims that import duties or other such fees required getting an item into your country. Do not pay such fees otherwise you will probably never get the product and lose any money you paid. We encourage you to make all the deals locally and in-person.  
• A buyer or seller suggests using an escrow service to complete the transaction. Often these escrow web sites are run by fraudsters and they take your money and never get the product.   
• An ad promises you can make a money working from your home. The information, your received, generally tells you how to set up a similar scam to trick other people.  
• You receive an email from a foreign official or attorney. They ask you to send money in return for a large lump sum being transferred to your bank account. Once you pay you will never hear from them again.

**How to report scams and fraud:**  
• If you find an ad on the Worldstuffer site that you suspect is scam, illegal, or otherwise violate Worldstuffer policies, please contact us.   
• If you reply to an ad and the person who posted the ad emails you with a suspicious request, please stop all communications with that person and contact us.  
• If you are the victim of fraud, inform Worldstuffer and your local police service.
