						<h2>About Work It, Mom!</h2>
						<p>Work it, Mom! is an online service for moms that allows our mom members to set up unique personal profiles and, through those profiles, to create an online network of other moms. Work it, Mom! members ("Members") can view each others' profiles, communicate with old friends and make new friends on the Site, share photos, write, post and read articles, post comments, participate in discussions, form groups, ask questions, and describe their interests. To enrich our Members' experience, we request and display some personal information to other Members and visitors, which allows our users to identify each other and expand their network of friends. Work it, Mom! members can change their profile information at any time and can control how other Members and Work it, Mom! communicates with them.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
						<p>User Provided Information. Work it, Mom! collects personal information from you when you register with our Site, update your profile, interact with other Members, and use various features of our Site. To register with Work it, Mom!, you must provide your name, and email address, and select a screen name. Once you are registered, you will be given the option to add additional personal information about you and your family to your profile. By using the privacy settings on your profile, you can control which Members have access to certain of your personal profile data. Keep in mind, however, that certain basic profile data cannot be hidden and will always be displayed on the Site once they register.</p>
						<p>We may also collect information regarding your interaction with other users and your use of the Site. From time to time we may ask you to respond to surveys or other requests for information and we collect the information you provide. We may collect information from you when you participate in sweepstakes and promotions offered on our Site. We may also collect information about you through other methods, including research surveys or information we obtain from third parties, including verification services, data services, as well as public sources. We use this information to continually offer you the most value as a Work it, Mom! Member.</p>
						<p>All personally identifiable information that we collect may become part of your Work it, Mom! Member file and may be used by Work it, Mom! as provided in this Privacy Policy or as disclosed at the time you provide the information or as otherwise agreed by you.</p>
						<p><strong>Web Logs</strong>. Like most standard Website servers, we collect information from all visitors to the Site. This information may include the browser you are using, the internet address from which you linked to our Site, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer you used to access our Site, and usage and browsing habits. We use this information to help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, to analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information. We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications.</p>
						<p><strong>Cookies</strong>. To help make sure you receive information that is relevant to you, our Site uses data "cookies."

						<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

You can choose to allow Members to search for you by using your real name or most other information you have entered in your profile.</p>
						<p>By using the search functionality on the Site, Work it, Mom! Members can find other moms with similar interests and challenges. When you find other Members, you can view their personal profiles to find out more about them based on the information they have decided to share on the Site.</p>
