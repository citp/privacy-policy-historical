# Privacy Policy | WorthPoint

**WorthPoint Corporation Privacy Policy**

WorthPoint takes its commitment to privacy seriously and, therefore, has adopted this privacy policy to let you know:

• How we collect information and what types of information we collect  
• How we use the information we collect and for what purposes  
• When and to whom information we collect may be disclosed  
• How we safeguard and protect Personal Information (defined below) you provide  
• The choices that are available to you regarding our collection and use of Personal Information  
• How you may access, review and change Personal Information you provide

For the purposes of this privacy policy, “Personal Information” is any personally identifiable information about an individual person such as a person’s name, physical address, email address and telephone number, and may include financial and other information provided by an individual who accesses our Websites and/or uses our services.

**Policy Scope**

This privacy policy applies to all of WorthPoint’s and WorthPoint’s affiliates and subsidiaries’ businesses, including, but not limited to our websites located at qa.worthpoint.com, www.goantiques.com, www.priceminer.com, and www.marksandlibrary.com (our “Websites”), and covers the use and disclosure of information that WorthPoint may collect any time you interact with us, (e.g., when you use our Websites, when you contact our customer service department, or when you purchase any of our products and services).

Our Websites are available worldwide and may be operated from various locations both within and outside the United States of America (“USA”). If you are accessing and using our Websites from outside the USA, please note the information that you provide will be transferred to the USA or other countries which may not provide the same level of legal data protection as the country from which you access our Websites. By using our Websites and submitting information to us, you consent to such transfers and the processing of information by us as described in this privacy policy and you authorize this practice.

WorthPoint’s Websites may provide links to websites owned or operated by third parties or otherwise direct you to websites owned or operated by third parties (“Linked Websites”). Your use of Linked Websites will be governed by terms of use, privacy policies and other additional terms, notices and policies set forth or referenced in those Linked Websites. This privacy policy does not reflect the information collection, use and disclosure practices of the Linked Websites or the operators or owners of Linked Websites. To understand how a Linked Website and the owners or operators of a Linked Website will collect, use, store and otherwise make available information you should review the Linked Website’s privacy policy.

**Updates and Changes to Policies**

WorthPoint may change this privacy policy from time to time by posting updated versions of the privacy policy here. If we make changes to the privacy policy we will post the changes on this page, and, if the changes are significant, we will post a more prominent notice on our Websites of such change. Please note that information we collect will be treated in accordance with the privacy policy in effect at the time the information is collected. This privacy policy was last updated in December, 2011.

**Information Collection, Use and Disclosure Practices**

Though you may access and use portions of our Websites without providing any Personal Information, in order to take advantage of the full capabilities of our Websites and to obtain access to, and use of, many of the features of our Websites, you must provide certain Personal Information. For example, in order to register for a membership account through our Websites (each a “Membership Account”), to sell items on our Websites, to access prices in our Worthopedia price guide and to request information about products and services offered on our Websites you must provide certain Personal Information.

Personal Information Provided Voluntarily by the User. When you register for a Membership Account you will be asked to provide Personal Information. You may also be asked to provide Personal Information when you participate in various services and offerings available through our Websites, when you contact us via phone, mail, or otherwise, and when you participate in our sweepstakes, contests, surveys and related promotions. The Personal Information we may collect and store includes, but is not limited to, the following categories of information:

your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, year of birth, and gender, information concerning your hobbies, interests and occupation, and financial information (for billing purposes); and community discussions, chats and correspondence.  
We use Personal Information you provide to us for our business purposes, such as (i) to allow you to access your Membership Account, (ii) to confirm your identity, (iii) for marketing our products and services to you and to customize this advertising and marketing information (iv) to contact you regarding your Membership Account and to keep records regarding your Membership Account, (v) to carry-out promotions, including but not limited to sweepstakes, contests surveys and related promotions that you have entered; (vi) to provide the services and products you request and to respond to your other requests and inquiries, (vii) to enhance our service offerings; and (viii) to adjust our Websites to your personal preferences.

We may share Personal Information you provide to us with certain third parties that perform services on our behalf. Those third parties may host our Websites; provide certain features or functionality; print or send mailings or emails (including marketing materials); provide the services you requested, authorize and process your payments; provide customer service; analyze data; or otherwise assist us with the operation of our business. Those third parties are not authorized to use or disclose Personal Information for any purpose other than to perform the services designated by WorthPoint. We may also provide the Personal Information you provide to us to a third party if we are required by law or litigation so to disclose such Personal Information. For example, we may be required to disclose Personal Information to respond to a subpoena, court order or other legal process. Finally, the Personal Information you provide to us may be transferred as an asset in connection with a merger or sale involving all or part of WorthPoint or as part of a corporate reorganization, stock sale or other change of control.

Information Collected from Other Sources. We may obtain information about you from other sources, such as companies that update and verify email and physical addresses, for the purpose of updating and enhancing our files.

Automatically Collected Information. When you access or use our Websites we automatically collect and store the following types of non-personally identifiable information (information that is compiled in anonymous and aggregate form and is not used to locate, contact, or identify you specifically), where available, in addition to the Personal Information you provide voluntarily: information from server logs found on your browser, click-through statistics, your IP address, the type of application (e.g. web browser) you are using to access our Websites, the type of operating system you are using, the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet, the date and time you access parts of the Websites, and the Internet address of the site from which you linked directly to our Websites. We use Google Analytics to learn about where our visitors come from and how they interact with the Website. Google and its wholly owned subsidiaries may retain and use, subject to the terms of the Google Privacy Policy (located at http://www.google.com/privacy.html , or such other URL as Google may provide from time to time), anonymous traffic data collected in our use of Google Analytics.

We will use the information we automatically collected through your access and use of our Websites to determine how our Websites are accessed and used. For example, this information will allow us (i) to determine which pages are the most popular with users, (ii) determine if our Websites are working properly, and (iii) to improve the user-experience on our Websites. We do not use automatically collected information to identify a particular user.

Marketing. We do not sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties for their marketing purposes. We may aggregate and use certain non-personally identifiable information for research or marketing purposes and may share, sell and rent or trade that information and statistical data derived from such information with our marketing partners, advertisers, or other third parties for research or marketing purposes.

**User Communities on our Websites**

Our Websites include community areas (e.g., forums, bulletin boards and chat rooms) in which you may participate after establishing a Membership Account. Although your participation in these communities is governed by this privacy policy, there are certain important characteristics of these communities that you should always keep in mind.

We use Membership Account registration information and other information users provide as they interact within the communities to: authenticate users; provide communications from us to users regarding the community; and administer the community (including, but not limited to, managing the technical requirements of the site and monitoring submissions and posts for offensive content after posting and removing such content in our sole discretion).

Please note that information (including your name, email address, address, or phone number) you provide in a posting on community or any bulletin board is available (even after you stop participating in the community) to any other individual who has access to that same community and may be used by another individual in a manner unintended by you, including as a target for unsolicited communications. You should therefore treat any information provided by you in the content of a submission or post to a community as public information. For this reason, we urge you to act cautiously in providing any such information in your submissions or posts, as we are not liable for any use or misuse by an individual user of the information you provide in a submission or post.

Upon termination of a community, Personal Information we collected through the community will continue to be treated in accordance with this privacy policy.

**Cookies and Related Technology**

We use Cookies (small files placed on your hard drive) to store information about your visits to our Websites and to enhance your experience when visiting our Websites. For example, we use Cookies to, among other things, identify previous visitors to our Websites, identify a user as he/she moves through our Websites, track user visits and account set-ups, determine what set-ups are most frequently requested, and save your password so you do not have to provide it each time you visit our Websites. Storing information about your visits to our Websites will allow us to, on occasion, customize account pages for you.

We do not use Cookies to collect, track, or store personally identifiable information. Our cookies will never be used to track your activity on any third party websites or to send spam. You can configure your browser to accept all Cookies, reject all Cookies, or notify you when a Cookie is received. (Each browser is different, so check the Help menu of your browser to learn how to change your Cookie preferences). You may reject, delete or otherwise disable Cookies at any time. However, by deleting, rejecting or otherwise disabling Cookies, you may interfere with your use of some of our Websites or services.

Some of our email communications to you may include a “click-through URL” linked to a particular page on one of our Websites. By clicking on one of these URLs, you will automatically enter one of our Websites. Our systems track this information to gauge the effectiveness of our email communications and your level of interest in particular areas. You may avoid having this information collected by avoiding clicking on URL links in our email communications. Please note, that we will NEVER send you an email with an imbedded link that asks for your password or any financial or account information; passwords are for your protection. If you EVER receive such an email, please contact us immediately using the information in the Section 9 below entitled “Contact Us”.

**Notice for Parents**

Our Websites are general audience sites that are not targeted for use by children. WorthPoint does not intend to collect Personal Information from individuals under the age of eighteen (18) on our through our Websites. If you are the parent or guardian of a child under the age of 18 who has provided Personal Information to us, please inform us as provided below in Section 9 (“Contact WorthPoint”) below, and we will delete that Personal Information.

**Security**

We employ reasonable security measures, including administrative, technical, and physical measures, to protect Personal Information from unauthorized access, loss, alteration, use or disclosure. However, Personal Information can never be 100% secure: third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Websites. Therefore although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect that your personal information or private communications information will always remain private. You can help us to protect the Personal Information you provide to us by (i) not sharing your password or other account information with others, (ii) using a secure web browser, and (iii) frequently changing your password.

**Managing Information**

You may update the information you provide by accessing your account and following the instructions for updating your information. You may opt-out of receiving certain types of communications from us (“Optional Communications”). However, you will not be able to opt-out of receiving other types of communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages, as these types of communications are necessary if you have an account with us. You may opt-out of receiving Optional Communications by following the instructions set forth in those communications or by accessing your account and following the instructions. If you have any questions regarding your ability to opt-out of receiving certain types of communications please contact us using our contact information set forth below in “Contact WorthPoint”. Please note that removal of Personal Information from our database or “opting-out” will not stop marketing or advertising content that is ready to be mailed or is queued for transmission to you prior to the time when we can implement your request.

We reserve the right to retain any Personal Information reasonably necessary to appropriately document our business activities and for archival and record retention purposes. We will store Personal Information for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this privacy policy.
