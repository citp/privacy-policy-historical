information from the Site to track, for example, the total number of visitors
to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the domain names
of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact
with the Services.  Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve
the users of the Services, the Company often conducts research on its customer
demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other
information provided to us, including our visitors' geographic location, age,
gender, job title and income. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an

use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On
most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Please refer

that help us better manage content on our Site by informing us what content is
effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in
function to cookies, and are used to track your online movements. In contrast
to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are
embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end

you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will
use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to
