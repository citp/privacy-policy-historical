Cookies and web beacons may be used to track information and identify categories of visitors by items such as IP address, domain, browser type and pages visited. In addition, on some websites, WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ and its advertisers may use small bits of code called "one-pixel gifs," or "clear gifs" embedded in some web pages, to make cookies more effective.

WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ may use advertising companies to deliver ads on some WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Websites. The advertising companies may also receive some anonymous information about ad viewing by Internet users on WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Websites and other Internet sites. This information may be associated with a customer's web browser, but cannot be associated with a name or e-mail address without the customer's permission. (This means that advertising companies may know where your computer goes on the Internet, but they don't know who you are unless you tell them.) This Site may contain links to other independent third-party WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Websites ("Linked Sites"). These Linked Sites are provided solely as a convenience to our Users. Such Linked Sites are not under WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL's control, and WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ is not responsible for and does not endorse the content of such Linked Sites, including any information or materials contained on such Linked Sites.

WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.

WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, If you go to another website, including an advertiser's Website (for example by clicking on an ad), and request information or enter a contest, be aware that you may be authorizing another company, including an advertising company, to use information you supply. WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ is not responsible for these other websites, it is up to the User to read their privacy policies, and choose whether to let them collect information about what you do on the Internet. Please note that if an advertiser asks WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but no? any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL's Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or WORLD PROPERTY JOURNAL™ Websites.
