Both from a corporate and employee level, WSL is committed to maintaining the highest standards of privacy and security in the way in which it conducts business. With regard to the privacy of any personal information, WSL pledges to conduct their business according to the following principles, which comply with, at least, the Australian Privacy Principles, which can be found in the “Privacy Legislation” by [clicking here](http://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-resources/privacy-fact-sheets/other/privacy-fact-sheet-17-australian-privacy-principles) (“Australian Privacy Principles”). Notwithstanding the above or reference to Australian standards, this privacy policy applies to use of Personal Information by WSL in each jurisdiction that WSL operates and WSL intends to comply with standards of each (“Privacy Policy”).

Personal Information is information about you that identifies you or information by which your identity or information about you can be reasonably determined (“Personal Information”). This Privacy Policy illustrates in general terms how WSL protects the privacy of your Personal Information. It also sets out the matters, which WSL is required to disclose to individuals under Australian Privacy Principle 1.4. The principles set out in this WSL Privacy Policy will apply to any Personal Information you provide to WSL and to information WSL collects about you from other sources (e.g. WSL events or your sponsors).

There may be specific principles detailed here which apply to certain situations of disclosure of information to or by WSL.

**2\. Collection of Personal Information**

If WSL requires Personal Information, it is generally collected directly from you. Personal Information is usually collected during the course of WSL’s relationship with you, and may be provided by you in correspondence (e.g. letter, form, email) through the WSL website, app or other digital experience branded WSL (each a “WSL Digital Asset”) or by entering competitions, events, promotions or membership application), or by your giving WSL such information in person.

Generally, the type of Personal Information WSL collects about you include matters relevant to the primary purpose for the information being collected, such as:

  * Telephone number;
  * Interests;
  * E-mail address;
  * Age;
  * Nationality;
  * Bank details;
  * Next of Kin;
  * Location;
  * IP Information (IP address, number, etc.)



**3\. Choice of Personal Information**

WSL is careful to recognize any valid requests from individuals to suppress their names from use for any reason and have various systems and procedures in place to ensure this suppression is provided efficiently when requested by the relevant individual. Any such requests should be made by contacting WSL directly on the contact details at the end of this Privacy Policy.

In some circumstances, WSL collects Personal Information about you from a third party source (e.g if WSL runs a competition or event in conjunction with a third party co-promoter and you provide your Personal Information to it). As a general rule WSL will attempt to ensure any third parties from whom it obtains Personal Information about you comply to the privacy law requirements of their jurisdiction and have advised you that it will or may be passed on to WSL and/or WSL will take reasonable steps to contact you and ensure that you are aware of the purposes for which WSL is collecting your Personal Information.

**7\. Third Parties Use of Personal Information**

WSL may engage third party contractors to perform services, which involve the contractor handling Personal Information that WSL holds.
