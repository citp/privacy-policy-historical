# Privacy Policy

At Worldwide Golf Shops, we are committed to protecting the privacy and security of any personal information you provide to us. This Privacy Policy explains our policies and practices for collecting, storing, using, sharing, and protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect through this website, through your purchases of our products wherever they are sold, and through marketing and promotional activities that we conduct from time to time.

Along with our Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy governs your use of our Web site. We may update this Privacy Policy as we continue to improve the services, products, and features we provide to you and as new developments in technology, law, or regulation call for changes. Please check this Privacy Policy from time to time to make sure you stay current.

## How Your Information is Collected and Used

When you purchase items from us or voluntarily submit information to us (for example, when you sign up for an account with WGS, send us e-mails or subscribe to our e-mail promotions, participate in sweepstakes, contests, or surveys, or post information on our website), we may collect personally identifiable information from you such as your name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number, and credit card number. We may use this information to provide you with the products and services you have requested, to investigate and answer questions or concerns you submit to us, to offer you opportunities to participate in promotional programs tailored to you, to list you as a winner of a contest or sweepstakes, or to notify you of information that may be of interest to you about Worldwide Golf Shops or our business partners and affiliates.

We may also collect non-personally identifiable information from you, (such as information regarding your interests, hobbies, preferences for products and services, and lifestyle) when you choose to provide it.

When you visit our website, we and our third-party service providers use a feature on your Internet browser called a "cookie" to identify you and enhance your experience on the site in various ways, such as by remembering your user name, password, and preferences, and tracking your click streams. Cookies are small files placed on your computer's hard drive. We and our third-party service providers use cookies and pixel tags to collect certain technical information from your computer when you visit our Web site, including your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, your computer's operating system, your browser type, and any referring Web site address. Most Internet browsers give you the option to reject cookies, but doing so generally hinders the browser's performance and will adversely affect your experience when using our Web site.

We partner with third-party Internet advertising companies, known as "ad networks," to serve ads for us across the Internet. Ad networks use cookies and pixel tags to collect information about your visits to our Web site and other Web sites so that they can deliver ads to you that may correspond to your interests. We do not share any personally identifiable information about you with these ad networks. If you prefer not to receive these ads, you may opt-out by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative's opt-out page, at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.

We may also obtain information about you from third parties, including demographic information (such as number of household members, age, and gender), and purchase preferences. We use such information to improve the accuracy of our customer database, increase our understanding of our customers, and identify potential customers.

## How Your Information May Be Shared

We do not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to outside marketers. We may, however, share such information in limited circumstances, outlined below.

We may share your information with our subsidiaries, affiliates, and trusted businesses partners, so that we, and they, can provide products and services you have requested and information and offers that may be of interest to you. In addition, we may share your information with third parties that need access to the information to help us fulfill your requests for products and services. We require all parties with whom we share this information to comply with our standards of quality and to comply with our policies for safeguarding your information.

When we collect aggregate data that does not include personally identifiable information, such as demographic and statistical information, we may share that data with third parties.

We may disclose your information when we believe any applicable law, regulation, or legal proceeding requires us to do so, or when disclosure is necessary to respond to claims against us, to protect our customers, to report or collect debts owed to us, or otherwise to protect our rights and property.

If WGS becomes involved in a merger, reorganization, or bankruptcy, we may transfer or otherwise share your information in connection with that transaction or event. 

## How Your Information Is Safeguarded

We enforce reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect against any unauthorized access to or disclosure of your information. We maintain your information on a secured server behind a firewall. All data is encrypted, and all data related to our retail services is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer technology.

This Privacy Policy applies only to WGS, and we do not control the privacy policies and practices of third parties, which may differ from ours. Because third parties may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect their own data, or make their own solicitations of personal information from you, we encourage you to read their privacy policies before using their websites. We assume no responsibility for your sharing of information with these third parties.
