The Association may also collect personal data of the same nature for any accompanying persons. The Association may also collect information where visitors or subscribers participate in certain Association activities, such as questionnaires and surveys, and through the use of cookies. When visitors request pages from our server, our web server automatically collects some information about them, including their IP addresses. These addresses are used by computers on the network to send the requested pages to visitors.

By using this website and providing your personal data to The Association you understand and agree that The Association and its affiliates may: a) use your personal data; and b) share your personal data with third parties, both as described below.

Where this is necessary, The Association will ensure that the appropriate safeguards are in place in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and also the Data Protection Act (2018).
