# Work Ministry - Privacy Statement

The team of Work Ministry is committed to protecting your privacy to the extent that the pubic domain of the Internet allows. If you have concerns about disclosure of your current employment, or perhaps disclosure of your contact information, please utilize the Confidentiality features of the resume posting process. Options available to you are: 

  * **Contact information:** Post a resume with limited information about location, perhaps an email address only, to assure your privacy. Employers need to know a general location, so providing a city or locale is helpful to your search process.
  * **Employment:** If you are currently employed and do not wish to disclose your employer, use the Confidential features of the posting process. In doing so, your resume and related information is not disclosed during searches of the database by employers or search/staffing firms. By using this feature, the only condition in which your information is disclosed is your response to a posting.



**One more note:** Work Ministry does not sell email addresses or any personal information, or conduct any e-mail ad campaigns using your contact information. Work Ministry takes every precaution to protect your personal information and prevent its unintended use by other parties. In addition, Work Ministry will not accept accounts from multi-level marketing firms or any other sources whose sole purpose is to sell products or services to clients.
