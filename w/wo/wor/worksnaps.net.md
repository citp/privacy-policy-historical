##### Information gathered by Worksnaps software program 

Worsknaps.net is a system that allows a work team to track time and share information for the purpose of productivity and accurate time tracking. The users who wish to track their time have a software program ("Worksnaps Client") running on their computer systems. Worsknaps Client automatically collects the following activity while a user is using the program: 

  * Random screenshot of the computer screen(s)
  * The volume of the keyboard strokes and mouse clicks. (Worksnaps Client only records the volume, not the specific key strokes.)
  * The title of the active window and its corresponding executable program path. This information is recorded with a sampling mechanism. 
  * Web-cam shot (if enabled)
  * Operation System type and version 
  * IP address of the user's computer system
  * Timestamps of the user's computer system



These information is only available to the user himself and any other users in the system that has the permissions to view them. The permissions are provisioned before Worksnaps Client is deployed and used. 

Worksnaps.net does not share the recorded information with any user on the system who does not have the permission to view them, nor share it with any party outside of the company. 

Worksnaps.net may use recorded information for statistical analysis and to maintain the security of the Worksnaps.net platform. 

##### Security

We use commercially reasonable methods to keep personally identifiable information securely in our database and file systems. For security of transactions, we use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts any information you send to us electronically. The encryption process protects your information, by scrambling it before it is sent to us from your computer. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
