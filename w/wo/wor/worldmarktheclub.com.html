In the event and to the extent that there are additional uses of your Personal Information by WVO's business partners or sponsors (which additional uses are not otherwise described in or contemplated by this Policy), any such additional uses will be specifically described to you prior to or at the time such Personal Information is collected or prior to any transfer of such Personal Information to the business partners or sponsors. Many promotions offer opportunities for you to request additional information from such business partners and sponsors. By requesting additional information, you signify your consent to WVO's transfer of your Personal Information to the applicable business partners or sponsors so that they can respond to or fulfill your request. Although, in many instances, only your email address will be shared with these business sponsors and partners, WVO is not limited to the type of Personal Information that it may disclose, provided that you requested the additional information and that WVO has otherwise complied with this Privacy Policy.</li>

We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure your information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.
