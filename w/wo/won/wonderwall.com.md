By virtue of these relationships, the third parties collect or obtain Information from you when you participate in the activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this Information. We encourage you to look at the privacy disclosure of any such third party to learn about their data practices before you participate in the activity.

#### Cookie Policy (Outside the EU)

Cookies are small text files containing information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website, including our Site. Cookies are then sent back to the originating web domain on your subsequent visits to that domain. Most web pages contain elements from multiple web domains so when you visit a website, your browser may receive cookies from several sources. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user’s device. Cookies allow you to navigate websites efficiently, remember preferences and generally improve the user experience. They can also be used to tailor advertising to your interests through tracking your browsing across websites. Session cookies are deleted automatically when you close your browser and persistent cookies remain on your device after the browser is closed (e.g. remembering your user preferences when you return to the Site).

We may also use pixels or "web beacons" that monitor your use of our Site. Web beacons are small electronic files integrated into the Site or our communications (e.g. emails) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email or for other related statistics. We may also integrate “Software Development Kits” (“SDKs”) into our applications to perform similar functions as cookies and web beacons. For example, SDKs may collect technical and usage information such as mobile device identifiers and your interactions with the Site and other mobile apps.

We may use cookies and other technologies to help recognize your browser or device, maintain your preferences, provide certain Site features, and collect Information about interactions with our Site, our content, and our communications.

We may also use cookies and other technologies (i) to provide, develop, maintain, personalize, protect, and improve our Site, products, programs, and services and to operate our business, (ii) to perform analytics, including to analyze and report on usage and performance of our Site and marketing materials, (iii) to protect against, identify, and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity, (iv) to create aggregate data about groups or categories of our users, (v) to synchronize users across devices, affiliates, business partners, and select third parties, and (vi) for us and our affiliates, business partners, and select third parties to target, offer, or market, products, programs, or services. Cookies and other technologies also facilitate and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through us and/or other networks or sites. By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, and agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site through the technologies described above, as well as similar technologies developed in the future, and that we may use such tracking technologies in the emails we send to you.

You may adjust your browser to reject cookies. Controlling cookies via browser controls may not limit our use of other technologies. Please consult your browser’s settings for more information. However, blocking cookies or similar technology might prevent you from accessing some of our content or features on the Site. We currently do not respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not been yet developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.

### HOW WE SHARE AND DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION

Whalerock controls your Information and is deemed a data controller as defined in the GDPR. We may share and disclose aggregated and de-identified Information about our users without restriction.

Where we engage data processors that process personal data outside of the EEA we will ensure that there will be an appropriate level of protection. In addition, we will implement legal safeguards governing such transfer, such as instruments similar to model contractual clauses, individuals' consent, or other legal grounds permitted by applicable legal requirements.

Certain countries outside the EEA have been approved by the European Commission as providing essentially equivalent protections as EEA data protection laws. EU data protection laws allow Whalerock to freely transfer personal data to such countries. Please contact us at [privacy@whalerockindustries.com](mailto:privacy@whalerockindustries.com) if you would like to see a copy of the safeguards we apply in relation to the export of your personal data.

**Service Providers**. We have engaged the following categories of data processors that process personal data on our behalf: our contractors, service providers, content providers, and other third parties we use to support our business may have access to Information to help carry out the services they are performing for us, including: creating, maintaining, hosting, and delivering of our Sites, products, and services; conducting marketing (for example to provide you with targeted advertisements with appropriate consent); handling payments, email and order fulfillment; administering contests; conducting research and analytics; and customer service.

**Marketing by affiliates and third parties.** We may disclose Information to affiliates, business partners, and third parties (e.g., retailers, advertisers, ad agencies, advertising networks and platforms, research organizations, and other companies) whose practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy and will act as controller. These parties may provide, offer, improve, market, and otherwise communicate with you about their own products and services. We will always ask your prior consent prior to any such disclosure.

**Sponsors and co-promotions**. We sometimes offer content or programs (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, promotions, or Social Media Site integrations) that are sponsored by or co-branded with third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties collect or obtain Information from you when you participate in the activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this Information. We encourage you to look at the privacy disclosure of any such third party to learn about their data practices before you participate in the activity.

**Linked Sites**. Some Sites contain links to other sites, including Social Media Sites. We may integrate social media application program interfaces or plug-ins (" _Plug-ins_ ") from social networks, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and others, into our Sites. Plug-ins may transfer information about you to the Plug-in's respective platform without action by you. This information may include your platform user identification number, which website you are on, and more. Interacting with a Plug-in will transmit information directly to that Plug-in's social network and that information may be visible by others on that platform. Plug-ins are controlled by the respective platform's privacy policy, and not by our Policy.

**Legal and Law Enforcement Purposes**. We may disclose Information in response to legal process, for example in response to a court order or a subpoena, or in response to a law enforcement agency's request. We may also disclose such Information to third parties: (i) for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction, (ii) where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, (iii) to enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including the Terms of Use, this Policy, and for billing and collection, (iv) if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect our rights, property, or safety or that of our customers, users, contractors or others, (v) as otherwise required by law.

**Ad Choices** **.** We may work with third parties to present advertisements, and engage in data collection, reporting, site analytics, ad delivery and response measurement on our Sites and on third party websites and applications over time. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, and other similar technology to perform this activity. They may also obtain information about websites you visit, applications you use, and other information from across your browsers and devices in order to present advertising that may be tailored to your interests on and off our Sites and across other platforms. This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising, and may be used to associate various browsers and devices together for the purpose of interest-based advertising and analytics.

For more information about interest-based advertising on your desktop or mobile browser, and your ability to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties, please visit [Your Online Choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) and/or the EDAA [Self-Regulatory Initiative for Online Behavioral Advertising](https://www.edaa.eu/). Please note that any opt-out choices you may exercise through these programs will only apply to interest-based advertising by the third parties you select. You may also continue to receive advertising, but that advertising may be less relevant to your interests.

You may have more options depending on your operating system or mobile device. Most device operating systems provide their own instructions on how to minimize or block delivery of tailored in-app advertising. You can review the privacy settings in such operating system to learn about limiting of tailored in-app advertising. You may also disable precise location information from a mobile device through your mobile device settings and choose to limit that collection.

**Cookies and Other Technologies**. We, and our affiliates, third party service providers, and business partners may send "cookies" to your computer or use similar technologies to enhance your online experience on our Sites and through our advertising and media across the Internet and mobile apps.

Cookies are small text files containing information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website, including our Sites. Cookies are then sent back to the originating web domain on your subsequent visits to that domain. Most web pages contain elements from multiple web domains so when you visit a website, your browser may receive cookies from several sources. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user's device. Cookies allow you to navigate websites efficiently, remember preferences and generally improve the user experience. They can also be used to tailor advertising to your interests through tracking your browsing across websites. Session cookies are deleted automatically when you close your browser and persistent cookies remain on your device after the browser is closed (e.g. remembering your user preferences when you return to the Sites).

We may also use pixels or "web beacons" that monitor your use of our Sites. Web beacons are small electronic files integrated into the Sites or our communications (e.g. emails) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email or for other related statistics. We may also integrate "Software Development Kits" ("SDKs") into our applications to perform similar functions as cookies and web beacons. For example, SDKs may collect technical and usage information such as mobile device identifiers and your interactions with the Site and other mobile apps.

We may also use cookies and other technologies (i) to provide, develop, maintain, personalize, protect, and improve our Sites, products, programs, and services and to operate our business, (ii) to perform analytics, including to analyze and report on usage and performance of our Sites and marketing materials, (iii) to protect against, identify, and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity, (iv) to create aggregate data about groups or categories of our users, (v) to synchronize users across devices, affiliates, business partners, and select third parties, and (vi) for us and our affiliates, business partners, and select third parties to target, offer, or market, products, programs, or services. Cookies and other technologies also facilitate and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through us and/or other networks or sites.

We currently do not respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.

These rights are subject to certain exemptions to safeguard the public interest (e.g. the prevention or detection of crime) and our interests (e.g. the maintenance of legal privilege).
