####  Children's Privacy 

We offer to our users a range of Services, some of which are primarily targeted at children, and others that are intended for users of all ages and their families. We are required under the Children Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), with limited exceptions, to obtain verifiable parental consent in order to collect, use, or disclose Personal Information from children. 

Many of our Services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children. If our Services request age information from your child and your child indicates that he/she is under 13 years old, the Service will block your child from providing personal information. **Please note, that if your child indicates that he/she is under the age of 13, your child WILL NOT be blocked from using our Services.**

For our Services that are primarily directed at children under the age of 13, we do not collect Personal Information, except in those instances under COPPA where Personal Information may be collected without verifiable parental consent. For example, if your child provides us feedback or contacts us (for support, for example), we will collect the data included in the communication. We will use this personal information to assist your child with his/her query or support request and then delete such information once we have fulfilled the child’s query or support request. We do not share your child’s personal information with third parties, other than as described in this Privacy Policy. 

We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records.
