We rely on one or more of the legal grounds set out below when processing your personal data: 

  * The processing is necessary for the provision and administration of your consumer credit agreement and for us to provide lending services, including assessing your application, managing your loan, collecting payments, recovering debts, making any amendments to your loan and providing other related services to you, such as resolving complaints

We will share your personal data with the categories of third parties listed below either for the purposes explained in section 5 of this Privacy Policy or where you have provided your consent. Where appropriate, we take the required steps to ensure that your personal data is protected by placing the party we are transferring information to under contractual obligations to protect it and to use it only as permitted by us. 

We may disclose your information to the following third parties: 

  * Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs) and Fraud Prevention Agencies (FPAs), the ways in which CRAs and FPAs use and share your personal data are explained in more detail in section 7 of this Privacy Policy 
  * Any firm, organisation or person we use to help us operate our lending business or to provide a service on our behalf, including providers of our payment systems, debt collection agencies we use to collect payments and recover debts, tracing agents or investigators, and suppliers who monitor use of social media to help us improve our credit decisions

##  7\. Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs) and Fraud Prevention Agencies (FPAs) 

To process your loan application, we will perform credit and identity checks on you with one or more credit reference agencies (CRAs) and we will make periodic searches at CRAs to manage your account with us. 

To do this, we will supply your personal data to CRAs and they will give us information about you. The data we supply will include information from your loan application and about your financial situation and financial history. CRAs will supply to us both public information (including from the electoral register and details of any county court judgments or bankruptcies) and shared credit, financial situation and financial history information (including information about previous credit applications and the conduct of your previous loan accounts) and fraud prevention information. 

We will use this information to: 

  * assess your creditworthiness and whether you can afford to take the product 
  * verify the accuracy of the data you have provided to us 
  * prevent criminal activity, fraud and money laundering 
  * manage your account and your loans 
  * trace and recover debts 
  * ensure any offers provided to you are appropriate to your circumstances 



We will continue to exchange information about you with CRAs while you have a relationship with us. We will also inform the CRAs about your settled accounts. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs. 

If you fall behind with your payments and a full payment or satisfactory proposal is not received within 28 days of a formal demand being issued, a default notice may be recorded with the CRAs. Any records shared with CRAs will remain on file for 6 years after your account is closed, whether any outstanding sums have been settled by you or following a default. 

When CRAs receive a search from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders. Large numbers of applications within a short time period may affect your ability to obtain credit, this is applicable whether you have been accepted or declined. 

If you have a spouse or financial associate, CRAs link your records together and these links will remain on your files until you or your partner successfully file for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link. 

If you give us false or inaccurate information and we have reasonable grounds to suspect fraud or we identify fraud we may record this and may also pass this information to fraud prevention agencies (FPAs) and other organisations involved in crime and fraud prevention, including law enforcement agencies who may access this information. If we determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide you with a loan. A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the FPAs and may result in others refusing to provide services to you. The FPAs can hold your personal data for up to 6 years. 

The CRAs that we use are Callcredit Limited and Equifax Limited. Further details about these CRAs, their role also as fraud prevention agencies, the data they hold, the ways in which they use and share personal information, data retention periods and your data protection rights with the CRAs are explained in more detail at [www.callcredit.co.uk/crain](https://www.callcredit.co.uk/crain "Callcredit") and [www.equifax.co.uk/crain](https://www.equifax.co.uk/crain "Equifax"). 

The FPA that we use is Cifas, with registered office at 6th Floor Lynton House, 7-12 Tavistock Square, London, WC1H 9LT. You can contact Cifas at [www.cifas.org.uk](https://www.cifas.org.uk/ "Cifas"). 

If you have any further questions about our use of CRAs or FPAs please contact us using the details set out in section 15 of this Privacy Policy. 

##  8\. What marketing activities do we carry out? 

We may share information within the Wonga Group to inform you of other products and services that might be of interest to you, but we will only do this where you have provided your consent. 

We are committed to only sending you marketing communications that you would like to receive. If you wish to unsubscribe from emails sent by us, you may do so at any time by clicking on the 'unsubscribe' link that appears in all emails. Otherwise you can update your preferences in the 'My account' section of your online account or by contacting us using the details set out in section 15 of this Privacy Policy. 

However, please note, if you opt out of receiving marketing emails we will continue to send you service related (non-marketing) communications, such as payment reminders. 

##  9\. How long do we keep your personal data? 

We will only keep your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the relevant purposes set out in this Privacy Policy and in compliance with our legal and regulatory obligations. 

Generally, your personal data will be held for the following time periods: 

  * If you have taken out a loan - 7 years from the closure of your last loan i.e. from when the loan was paid in full or written off 
  * If your loan is subject to any complaint, legal claim, redress or remediation - 6 years from the closure of the case 
  * If you have had a loan application declined - 5 years from the decline decision 
  * If you opened an account but did not apply for a loan - 90 days. However, if you opted in to receive marketing, we will hold your contact details (name, address, email address and telephone number) for 3 years. 



If you have a question about the periods for which your personal data will be stored, please contact us using the details set out in section 15 of this Privacy Policy. 

##  10\. Security 

We recognise how important it is to protect and manage the information you share with us and we are committed to keeping your personal data secure. We use a range of organisational and technical security measures to protect your information including safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption. We enforce appropriate physical access controls to our buildings, and we only authorise access to our buildings and files to those employees who require it to fulfil their job responsibilities. 

When you share personal data with us through our website, that information is protected and our security systems meet or exceed industry standards. 

##  11\. Transfer of personal data 

Our main database is kept in the UK. However, we also have operations in the Republic of South Africa and your personal data will also be accessed from that location. In addition, we (or third parties acting on our behalf) may process your personal data in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). In both cases when we transfer your personal data outside of the EEA we take the required steps to ensure that your personal data is protected by placing the party we are transferring information to under contractual obligations to protect it to adequate standards and, where relevant, by ensuring that such party is a member of a scheme that has been approved by the European authorities as providing a suitable level of protection, for example the Privacy Shield scheme agreed between the European and US authorities. If you have a question about the steps we take to safeguard your personal data, please contact us using the details set out in section 15 of this Privacy Policy. 

##  12\. Your rights 

Under data protection law you have certain rights in relation to the personal data that we hold about you. You may exercise these rights at any time by contacting us using the details set out in section 15 of this Privacy Policy. 

Please note that in some cases we may not be able to comply with your request for reasons such as our own obligations to comply with other legal or regulatory requirements. However, we will always respond to any request you make and if we can't comply with your request, we will tell you why. Your rights include: 

###  The right to access your personal data 

You are entitled to a copy of the personal data we hold about you and certain details of how we use it. This is called a Data Subject Access Request, which you can make by writing to [customercare@wonga.com](mailto:customercare@wonga.com). There will not usually be a charge for dealing with these requests. 

Your information will be provided to you in writing, unless otherwise requested. 

You also have the right to request the credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies to provide you with the information that they hold about you. You must contact them directly to do this. 

###  The right to rectification 

We want to make sure that your information is accurate and up to date. You may ask us to correct or remove any information that you think is inaccurate or you can update your contact details, personal details and payment details yourself in the 'My account' section of your online account. 

###  The right to erasure 

You have the right to ask us to erase your personal data, for example where you withdraw your consent to our processing (if we are relying on consent as our legal ground). However, we usually retain personal data in accordance with applicable laws (for example, laws that specify how we manage your credit agreement) which may mean we cannot process your request. 

###  The right to restriction of processing 

In certain circumstances, you are entitled to ask us to stop using your personal data, for example where you think the personal data we hold about you may be inaccurate. 

###  The right to data portability 

In certain circumstances, you have the right to ask that we transfer personal data you have already provided to us back to you or to a third party. 

###  The right to object to the processing of your personal data (for example, marketing emails) 

Where we process your personal data on the legal ground that we have a legitimate business need, you may object and we will consider your objection. Please use the contact details set out in section 15 of this Privacy Policy. 

You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time. You can do this either by clicking the 'unsubscribe' link that appears in all emails, or you can update your preferences in the 'My account' section of your online account, or you can contact us using the details set out in section 15 of this Privacy Policy. 

###  The right to request a manual review of an automated decision (including profiling) 

Credit-related decisions about whether and how much to lend to you are made automatically. We process the personal data you have provided to us, together with any of your personal data included in our records such as previous loan payment history and that which we have obtained from the credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies. We use this information to evaluate automatically your ability to pay back a loan and provide you with a credit score, which enables us to make fair and responsible lending decisions. The consequence of this automated processing is that we may decide not to lend to you or we may decide to offer to lend to you an amount less than you applied for. The credit scoring methods we use to make these credit-related decisions are regularly tested to ensure they remain fair, effective and unbiased. 

We also decide automatically whether you pose a fraud or money laundering risk. We process your information to see if your behaviour is either consistent with that of known fraudsters or money launderers or inconsistent with your previous submissions, or you appear to have deliberately hidden your true identity. The consequence of this automated processing is that we may decide not to lend to you and we may pass this information to fraud prevention agencies and other organisations involved in crime and fraud prevention. 

You may contact us to request that any decision to decline your loan application is reconsidered manually by our employees using the contact details set out in section 15 of this Privacy Policy. 

###  The right to withdraw consent 

For certain uses of your personal data, we will ask for your consent. Where we do this, you have the right to withdraw your consent to further use of your personal data (if we are relying on consent as our legal ground). 

###  The right to lodge a complaint with the ICO 

You have a right to complain to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) if you believe that any use of your personal data by us is in breach of applicable data protection laws and regulations. 

More information can be found on the ICO's website: [ico.org.uk](https://ico.org.uk/ "Information Commissioner's Office"). 

Making a complaint will not affect any other legal rights or remedies that you have.

Our website may contain links to third party websites. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own terms and conditions and privacy policies and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for their policies or processing of your personal data.
