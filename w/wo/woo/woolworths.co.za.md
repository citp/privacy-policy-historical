Protecting your privacy is as important to us as it is to you. For us, it’s more than just making sure we comply with the relevant legislation; you trust us with your personal information and we respect that trust. This privacy notice explains why and how we collect, use and store your personal information.

### We need your information to deliver the right product, at the right time and in the right place.

We ask for your information to make sure that we can offer the right product at the right time and in the right place.

### Sometimes we have to send your personal information to other countries.

Some of these service providers may be located in other countries that may not have the same levels of protection of personal information as South Africa. If this is the case, we require that they undertake to protect the personal information of our customers to the same level that we do.
