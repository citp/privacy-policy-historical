Your privacy is important to us. To better explain how Rockler collects, stores, and uses personal information on our site, we have prepared this privacy policy. 

**What information is collected on this site?**

**Your Email Address**

If you supply us with your email address in an online form, we will send you a periodic email newsletter with links to articles on our website and other promotions on occasion.

You can also send change- or removal-of-address requests to contentcoordinator@woodworkersjournal.com

It has always been and will continue to be our policy not to share email addresses with third parties.

**Where Your Information Is Stored**

Orders for Woodworker’s Journal products (including individual issue copies, plans and products) are made through our commerce website, www.rockler.com. You can the ecommerce Privacy Policy for that website [here](http://www.rockler.com/privacy-policy/).

Magazine subscriptions are handled by our distributor CDS Fulfillment. More information about how CDS handles customer information can be found [here](https://www.cds-global.com/company/privacy-notice).

Woodworker’s Journal uses iContact, a United States based firm, to send our weekly newsletter, marketing e-mails and sponsored partner e-mails. You can review iContact’s privacy policy [here](https://www.icontact.com/legal/privacy). iContact collects data on its secured servers on what users subscribe to our newsletters and open our e-mails. We also collect anonymous data on the performance of the links in our e-mail. You can unsubscribe from our e-mails at any time utilizing the Unsubscribe link at the top and bottom of our e-mails.

You can request information on how your data is stored and related information to [info@woodworkersjournal.com](mailto:info@woodworkersjournal.com)

**Your Phone and Fax Numbers**

If you supply us with your phone or fax number online, we may use them to contact you regarding an order you sent, a question you asked, or a contest you entered. We do not share these numbers with other organizations.

**Website Traffic**

Woodworker’s Journal uses Google Analytics to review how our customers use our website. We use this information to identify broad industry trends and article performance to better tailor our future content to the general interest of our audience. We do not collect specific information about our audience and all tracking information is anonymous.

**Premium Content**

Subscribers to Woodworker’s Journal physical and digital magazine have access to the Premium Content section of our website. The data collected from these login forms are stored in the CDS Fulfillment database and not on WoodworkersJournal.com. WoodworkersJournal.com does not retain any records of this data or login information. A cookie will be created on your computer that will allow your browser to remain logged in to our website until you either delete this cookie or your subscription runs out.

**Cookies**

The paragraphs below outline some of the common practices used by a majority of publishing and ecommerce sites. A couple of terms you will need to know:

_Cookies_ – These are small text files that are stored directly on your computer. They make it easier for the server to recognize your computer as you click from page to page (to keep track of your shopping cart as you browse our site, for example). The cookies do not actually contain any personal data.

_Pixel Tags_ – these are very tiny images (smaller than the periods in this paragraph). They are there to inform our web server or e-mail server that you have opened an e-mail, for example, and to communicate other actions.

The Woodworker’s Journal website, online services, interactive applications, e-mail messages, and advertisements may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our website people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of our communications and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information.

Woodworker’s Journal and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to “remember” how you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with our sites more convenient and personal. You may set your web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. However, should you decide not to accept cookies from our sites, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our sites.

As is true of most websites, our web servers gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Woodworker’s Journal may use this information, as compiled in the aggregate and without personally identifying characteristics, in our marketing and advertising services.

Pixel tags enable us to send e-mail messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.
