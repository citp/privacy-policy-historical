<p><em>Document revised: March 14th, 2018</em></p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome and thank you for visiting Woozworld’s website located at <a href="https://www.woozworld.com/">www.woozworld.com</a> &nbsp;(the <strong>“Website</strong>”). At Woozworld Inc., a company based in Montreal, Province of Quebec in Canada (“<strong>Woozworld</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>” or “<strong>our</strong>”), we are committed to protecting the online privacy of our members and guests of our Website. To that end, we have designed this privacy policy (the “<strong>Policy</strong>”) to address your questions and concerns about our practices and principles for personally identifiable information (“<strong>PII</strong>”), including how we collect, use and disclose such information.</p>

<p><strong>If you are a minor, your parent or legal guardian </strong>(a <strong>“Parent”) must review the </strong><a href="https://www.woozworld.com/code-of-conduct?sf_culture=en_WD"><strong>Code of Conduct</strong></a> <strong>, this Policy and the </strong><a href="https://www.woozworld.com/terms-of-use?sf_culture=en_WD"><strong>Terms of Use</strong></a><strong> of the Website with you, explain anything that you may not fully understand and approve them with you.</strong> Woozworld offers the Website to the Parents and their children (referred to as “<strong>you</strong>”, “<strong>your</strong>” or “<strong>user</strong>”) in accordance with this Policy. Parents, please help us protect your children’s privacy by instructing them never to provide PII on this Website or any other without your permission.</p>

<p>Woozworld applies its best efforts and generally accepted industry standards to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of your PII. We do not collect or keep any PII from you unless you volunteer it. A child’s participation in an activity is not conditional to the child providing more PII than is reasonably necessary for that activity.</p>

<p>This Policy is applicable to the Website and all associated products and services available on the Website. It summarizes Woozworld’s data collection policies and practices on the Website and does not apply to the practices of companies that Woozworld does not own or control, or to people that Woozworld does not employ or manage.</p>

<p><strong>Your use of the Website means that you accept the terms of this Policy. By using the Website, you agree to the collection, use, transfer and processing of PII as described in this Policy by Woozworld. If you do not accept the terms of this Policy, please discontinue the use of the Website immediately and at all times.</strong></p>

<h2>2. COPPA and PRIVO-Cert™ Safe Harbor Certification Program</h2>

<p>Woozworld complies with the U.S. <a href="http://coppa.org/">Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act</a> (“<strong>COPPA</strong>”). The COPPA requires that we inform the Parents on how we collect and use PII from their children under the age of 13.</p>

<p>Woozworld (owned and operated by Woozworld Inc.) is a Member of the PRIVO-Cert™ Safe Harbor Certification Program (<strong>“the Program”</strong>). As a participating member in the Program, Woozworld (owned and operated by Woozworld Inc.) adheres to the strict information collection, use and disclosure requirements set forth by the Program. PRIVO is an independent, third-party organization committed to safeguarding children's personal information collected online. PRIVO aims to help parents and their children exercise control over personal information while exploring the Internet. The PRIVO certification seal posted on this page indicates that Woozworld (owned and operated by Woozworld Inc.) has established COPPA compliant privacy practices and has agreed to submit to PRIVO’s oversight and consumer dispute resolution process. If you have questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please contact us at <a href="https://www.woozworld.com/support/contact?sf_culture=en_WD">https://www.woozworld.com/support/contact</a>. If you have further concerns after you have contacted us, you can contact PRIVO directly at <a href="mailto:privacy@privo.com">privacy@privo.com</a>.</p>

<h2>3. What information is collected and how it is used</h2>

<p>When an account is created, the user’s <strong><em>date of birth</em></strong>, <strong><em>gender</em></strong> and <strong><em>email address</em></strong> are requested. If the user is under the age of 13, the <strong><em>Parent’s email</em></strong> is also required. Woozworld will communicate by email with the Parent notifying the Parent that the account was created and giving the Parent the option to ask for the account deletion along with all the PII collected at registration. The email address of a child under 13 will only be used for login and password reminder purposes. Woozworld will communicate with a child of 13 and over when the account is created, to validate the child’s email address.</p>

<p>The age and gender are used as aggregate statistical data to gain insight within the Website’s audience. The age is also used, as explained above, to determine if a user is under the age of 13 in order to obtain the Parent’s email.</p>

<p>Your email can be used to identify your account if you contact Woozworld for any questions or assistance. The child’s email address will never be publicly visible in the advanced features and the Parent’s email address is never visible anywhere. Within the scope of the advanced features, Woozworld will send you communications such as updates, notifications, promotional invitations and news concerning the Website, through the games messaging system.</p>
<p>The text entered in the WoozIn, as well as in-game chat and in private messages is filtered through <a href="http://communitysift.com/" target="_blank">CommunitySift</a> smart filtering system, which aims to prevent, amongst other things, the user from exchanging PII such as phone numbers or email addresses with other users. CommunitySift does not share our user’s information with any other third parties.</p>

<p>Depending on the user’s method of payment in our online stores (and if they are over 13 years old, &nbsp;located in the United States), some additional PII will be requested as described below. We use Secure Sockets Layer technology to protect credit card data during transmission and our transaction operators adopt strict internal procedures to safeguard this information in their system. Our payment solution providers are also under contract to safeguard your PII and not to share it under any circumstances.</p>

<h3>Content Retention Policy</h3>

<p>When you cancel your account, we keep your data on our servers for at least 30 days in case you change your mind. Beyond that we purge account data from our servers on a regular basis. The purge removes all personal information from the account, blocks your woozin, unfriends all contacts and locks all virtual spaces. You can specifically request to have your request reversed by contacting us fill this form <a href="https://www.woozworld.com/support/contact?cacr">https://www.woozworld.com/support/contact?cacr</a> before the 30 days. Anything you delete on your account while it's active will also be permanently deleted.</p>

<p>The following private information is kept while the account is active:
</p><ul style="list-style: circle; padding-left: 25px; margin: 25px 0;">
<li>cookie id as visitor unique identifier</li>
<li>email as account unique identifier</li>
<li>avatar name</li>
<li>IP</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h2>4. Advanced Features</h2>

<h3>Communications</h3>

<p>As explained above, Woozworld may send you updates, notifications, promotional invitations or news concerning the Website through the games messaging system.</p>

<h3>Contests and surveys</h3>
<p>If you participate in our contests and surveys no PII will be required to do so. If you win a prize within a contest, which needs to be awarded outside the Website, we will communicate with you through the validated email address provided when you created your account and will agree with you how to award your prize. If you are under the age of 13, these arrangements will be taken care of with your Parent and your Parent’s full verifiable consent will be required in order to provide us your <strong><em>mailing address</em></strong> and other PII needed to award your prize.</p>

<h3>Online Stores</h3>
<p>We offer the opportunity to purchase products in our online stores. When a user places an order, our third party’s transaction processor will require the following PII for a payment:</p>
- by credit card: <strong><em>username</em></strong>, <strong><em>full name of card holder</em></strong>, <strong><em>email address</em></strong>, <strong><em>mailing address</em></strong> and <strong><em>credit card information</em></strong>; or
- by cell phone (SMS): username, <strong><em>cell phone number</em></strong> and <strong><em>email address</em></strong>.

<p>After an order online is placed, we send a confirming email message and/or a SMS depending on the payment method. We may also send an occasional email featuring a special promotion or product that may be of interest to you. Any user who prefers not to receive promotional emails can indicate this preference in the account settings. Please note that, for legal reasons and for your protection, it is not possible to unsubscribe from transaction confirmation notifications when buying from the Website.</p>
<p>For purchases made by credit card or through a PayPal account, the purchaser must be at least 18 year old and have a valid credit card or bank account. The SMS method of payment is not offered to users under 13 of age in the USA.</p>

<h3>Upcoming developments</h3>
<p>We are always working on new ideas to make the Website even more fun.&nbsp;We may send notification through the games messaging system to promote challenges, contests, leaderboard updates, new games and weekly digests.</p>

<h2>5. Cookies, IP Addresses and Clear GIFs</h2>
<p>A <strong><em>cookie</em></strong> is a small file that we save on your computer's hard drive and that contains non-personal information. Cookies help to give you faster access to pages you have already visited and allow you to personalize your pages. They help you to participate in some activities or events on the Website. If you leave the Website and return, cookies allow us to quickly display your collected items and game progress upon your return. We also use cookies to help us count the number of visits on the Website, track which sections of the Website are most visited and find out the length of time spent in the different sections. This information helps us understand which sections and features are appreciated or need improvement. Cookies are not used to collect and share with third parties any PII&nbsp;for any users under the age of 13 in the United States. If you are a parent in the US and suspect that your child has falsely declared his age, please contact us immediately. If you wish to know more about web browsing activities and how to opt-out of interstest-based advertising, please visit this page : <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-are-my-options" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-are-my-options</a></p>
<p>We collect <strong><em>Internet protocol (“IP”) addresses</em></strong>, which is the automatic number assigned to your computer when you surf on Internet. We may use your IP address (i) to gather statistics on geographical distribution of our users, (ii) as a geographic filter for specific features or offers per location or (iii) to help us investigate in the case of bad behavior like account theft, hacking or bullying, and provide the information to authorities in the case of a police investigation for a serious crime.</p>
<p>We also use other technology called Clear GIFs to provide us with other important anonymous information, such as when an email has been opened.</p>
<p>Cookies, IP address and Clear GIFs are not connected to any PII.</p>

<h2>6. Third Parties</h2>
<p>Except for third parties required in operating the Website as described previously and except as described below, we never share PII with people or companies outside Woozworld or sell it. Before Woozworld discloses any user’s PII to a third party as provided herein, the third party agreed to maintain the confidentiality and security of the information.  The following applies to all users located in the United States. Once the account has been created and the user’s age has been determined to be 13 or older, the account becomes subject to regular advertisement. If the user’s age is below 13, the account is subject to COPPA compliant advertisement only.  Users without an account are always considered to be under 13 and subject to COPPA compliant advertisement only. For more information on our third parties/partners, please click <a href="http://www.woozworld.com/thirdparties?sf_culture=en_WD">here</a>.</p>

<h2>7. Disclosure</h2>
<p>The only other situations where we may disclose PII to third parties would be to protect the security or integrity of the Website, to take precautions against liability, or to respond to judicial processes, legitimate requests by law enforcement officials or as otherwise required in order to comply with applicable law.</p>


<h2>8. Links</h2>
<p>Please take note that the Website may contain links to third party sites ("<strong>Linked Sites</strong>") and any activities you engage in connection with a Linked Site are subject to the privacy policy and terms of use as defined by the operator of the Linked Site. Please read Website's <a href="http://www.woozworld.com/terms-of-use?sf_culture=en_WD">Terms of Use</a> for further details. <strong>WOOZWORLD DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY LINKED SITES.</strong></p>

<h2>9. Customer Service</h2>
<p>If you contact customer service by email, we will ask for your email address and name of Woozen. If you contact customer service by telephone, you may be asked for your email and/or phone number. The PII provided within a customer service request will not be used for any other reason than to respond to your specific request and the telephone number of a user under the age of 13 will not be stored in the system.</p>

<h2>10. Communications within Website</h2>
<p>Woozworld may, at its sole discretion, record or store communications submitted through messages, bulletin boards, forums or chat rooms and may monitor, filter and review such communications for the purpose of monitoring content, enforcing Website rules, and investigating and detecting unauthorized use of the Website.</p>

<h2>11. No Other Information</h2>
<p>You will never be asked for any additional PII while using the Website. &nbsp;We provide as many privacy protection measures as reasonably possible to insure that no other additional PII is communicated or exchanged within the Website. Woozworld employees and on-line moderators (known as Woozband avatars) will never ask you for additional PII. &nbsp;NEVER GIVE YOUR PASSWORD UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. Please be vigilant and report any user attempting to obtain PII or your password by contacting us at <a href="https://www.woozworld.com/support/contact?sf_culture=en_WD" target="_blank">our Help page</a>.</p>

<h2>12. Modifications</h2>
<p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change this Policy to accommodate product improvement, new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for any other purposes. &nbsp;We will provide notice to you and post a notice on the Website if these changes have material impact on Woozworld’s use of PII and, where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent. &nbsp;An updated version of this Policy can be found at all times on the Website. &nbsp;You are responsible for regularly reviewing this Policy. &nbsp;Your continued use of the Website means you accept any changes in this Policy.</p>

<h2>13. Reviewing PII</h2>
<p>Upon proper identification, you or your parents may review your PII, request change or deletion or refuse to allow further collection or use of the information by contacting us at <a href="https://www.woozworld.com/support/contact?sf_culture=en_WD" target="_blank">our Help page</a> or by telephone at +1 (514) 281-8999. However, if you or your parents ask us to delete any required PII for certain advanced features, your access to those features will not be possible in the future.</p>
