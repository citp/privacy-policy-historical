The WoozIn is Woozworld’s social network where the Woozens (users) can exchange their thoughts on their Wallz, in game picture, show their achievements, friends and more! The WoozIn postz, as well as all in-game chat and private messages are filtered through Crisp Thinking TM smart filtering system which prevents the user from exchanging Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as phone number or email address. 
</p>
<p>An important part of the WoozIn is the notification system that keeps you informed of what’s going on in Woozworld and amongst your friend. You can configure the WoozIn in such ways you can receive an email every time someone sends you an in game message, postz something on your wall.</p>
<p>The WoozIn is also the place where you will be able to share your passion for music by posting links to YouTube TM and iTunes TM.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, we need you to validate your email address and have verifiable parental or legal guardian consent for U13 users. Upon visiting the WoozIn for the first time, a mail will be sent to the parents email for them to review and accept the Privacy Policy and <a href="http://www.woozworld.com/condition" class="special">Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>

<p><b>SMS Payment</b>
<br><br>
In order to use SMS payment, one must provide their mobile phone number. Such information is considered Personally Identifiable Information (PII) under COPPA and thus requires verifiable parental consent for U13 users. Upon visiting the SMS tab in the store for the first time, a mail will be sent to the parents email for them to review the Privacy Policy and <a href="http://www.woozworld.com/condition" class="special">Terms and Conditions</a> and click on a link to accept them. 
</p>
<p>Parents or legal guardian can always change their mind by login in the account, go in account settings, check or uncheck the SMS authorization check box which will send an email to the parent’s email to approve the modification. </p>

<p><b>Comufy</b>
<br><br>
We currently use Comufy as a partner to help you invite people to Woozworld from you address book. In this process, Woozworld does not record any information you provide in the process so there are no privacy issue. However, we may in the future use Comufy to send you Instant Messages (IM) to your favorite IM tool. When the time is right and we start using this feature, we will request your approval before collecting your information. In the case of children under 13, an email will be sent to your parent or legal guardian for them to accept the Privacy Policy and <a href="http://www.woozworld.com/condition" class="special">Terms and Conditions</a> in order for you to be able to use the feature. 
</p>

<p><b>Arcadet</b>

The Woozband is always working on new ideas to make Woozworld more fun. Soon, we will offer mini-games to be played inside our world. Some of those games might be developed by us and others by third parties.  
</p>
<p>Once again, email notification will be send to promote challenges, contests, leaderboard updates, new games and weekly digest. Cookie will be used to track game progress so you won’t have to start all over again.</p>
