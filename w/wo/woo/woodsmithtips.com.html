				1. How does August Home collect and use my e-mail address?
			</h4>
			<p>
				E-mail addresses may be collected when you subscribe to one of
				our magazines. We will use your e-mail address to contact you
				when it is time to renew your subscription and to send you
				information on August Home products or services. We do not
				currently rent, sell or give email addresses to any third
				party; however, in the future, we may rent only those email
				addresses collected from magazine subscriptions to reputable
				third parties who wish to promote their products or services to
				you via e-mail.
			</p>
			<p>
				When ordering a gift subscription, you are given the option of
				providing the recipient’s e-mail address for August Home
				to notify him or her of their gift subscription. Unless the
				gift recipient chooses in the future to provide August Home
				with his or her e-mail address, recipients will be contacted
				via e-mail for gift notification purposes only and will not
				receive any further electronic correspondence from August Home
				or third parties.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also collect your e-mail address in a variety of other
				circumstances including, but not limited to, when you sign up
				to receive e-mail tips, take part in a survey, participate in a
				forum, order a product or sign up to receive electronic
				information or other value added content available through
				purchase of a special interest book. We will contact you via
				e-mail, depending on the circumstances which you had provided
				your e-mail address. For example, we may contact you to send
				you e-mail tips, to notify you if you are a winner of an online
				contest, to confirm your identity as part of a forum, to e-mail
				you a lost password or user i.d., to answer a question you have
				about a product you ordered or to notify you if a product you
				ordered is out of stock, or if requested, to provide shipping
				quotes.  Personally identifiable information will be collected
				from registrants of the various online forums provided by
				August Home as a service to users of the website (the
				“Forums”). Forum registrants will be asked to provide a login
				name, a display name and email address. This information will
				be used to create a registration account, which will be
				protected by a password of user’s choosing. Users are
				responsible for taking all reasonable steps to ensure that no
				unauthorized person has access to the user’s Forum account and
				password. Users are solely responsible for: (1) controlling the
				dissemination and use of the user’s display name, and password;
				(2) authorizing, monitoring and controlling access to and use
				of the user’s Forum display name and password; and (3) promptly
				informing August Home of any need to deactivate a password.
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to keep you up-to-date on the services and products
				offered by August Home, we may occasionally contact you via
				e-mail to alert you of specific offers, products or services
				that we feel may be of interest to you. We will not, unless
				otherwise indicated in this privacy policy, rent, sell or give
				your e-mail address to any third party.
			</p>
			<p>
				Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code,
				residents of California have the right to request from a
				business, with whom the California resident has established
				business relationships, certain information with respect to the
				types of personal information the business shares with third
				parties for direct marketing purposes by such third party and
				the identities of the third parties with whom the business has
				shared such information during the immediately preceding
				calendar year. To make such a request, please write to us at
				the address for August Home Publishing Company Customer Service
				as set forth in Section 2 below.
			</p>
			<h4 id="q2">
				2. How do I stop receiving e-mails from August Home?

				from August Home and you wish to stop receiving or unsubscribe
				from any similar e-mails, you may either (1) click the
				“unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each e-mail or

			</p>
			<h4 id="q3">
				3. How does August Home collect and use telephone numbers and
				street addresses?
			</h4>
			<p>
				We collect telephone numbers and street addresses in certain
				circumstances including, but not limited to, when customers
				purchase a product for themselves or others from one of August
				Home’s e-commerce web sites or order a subscription for
				themselves or others to one of our magazines. We will use
				customers’ street addresses to fulfill orders or magazine
				subscriptions. We or one of our business partners working on
				our behalf may use customers’ street addresses and/or
				telephone numbers to contact them if there is a question about
				an order, if something is out of stock or to notify a customer
				when it is time to renew his or her subscription. In order to
				keep customers up-to-date on the services and products offered
				by August Home, we may occasionally use our customers’
				street addresses and/or telephone numbers to alert them of
				specific August Home offers, products or services that we feel
				may be of interest to them. As a subscriber, our
				customers’ street addresses and/or telephone numbers may
				be rented to reputable third parties who wish to promote their
				product or service.
			</p>
			<h4 id="q4">
				4. How can I stop receiving telephone calls or mailings from
				August Home or third parties?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Please contact August Home Customer Service at the above
				telephone number or address if you do not want us to contact
				you regarding renewal of your magazine subscription or to
				receive August Home products or services. You may also contact
				August Home Customer Service if you do not want us to share
				your street address or telephone number with third parties.
			</p>
			<h4 id="q5">
				5. Can I be identified when I browse the web site?
			</h4>
			<p>
				In general, you can browse this web site without telling us who
				you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.
				We are, however, able to determine your internet service
				provider’s (ISP) address and domain name (i.e. aol.com,
				hotmail.com, etc.). We use this information to help administer
				this web site, to measure the use of the web site and to
				improve the content of the web site. So we know where, in a
				general sense, our visitors are coming from, but we do not know
				who you are unless you tell us by filling out a form.
			</p>
			<p>
				Notwithstanding, August Home does research on our users’
				demographics, interest and behavior based on the information
				provided to us while browsing the web site. This research is
				compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. Aggregated data
				does not include personally identifiable information. August
				Home may share this aggregated data with others.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, some of our web pages may contain cookies, which
				are tiny data files that are sent to your web browser and
				stored on your computer. This allows our web server to
				recognize you when you visit the web site in the future. Most
				web browsers can be configured to not accept cookies, or to
				notify you if a cookie is sent. If you choose not to accept
				cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of certain
				features of the web site that are available to other visitors.
			</p>
			<h4 id="q6">
				6. What is August Home’s policy on collecting information
				from children?
			</h4>
			<p>
				August Home’s web sites are not directed toward children
				and August Home does not intend to collect personally
				identifiable information from children under the age of 13
				without the permission of the child’s parent or legal
				guardian. Children under the age of 13 should submit personally
				identifiable information to August Home only with the explicit
				permission of their parent or legal guardian. If your child has
				submitted personal information and you would like that
				information to be removed from our database, you may contact
				August Home as indicated above and we will use reasonable
				efforts to comply with your request.
			</p>
			<h4 id="q7">
				7. What is August Home’s relationship to third parties or
				other web sites?
			</h4>
			<p>
				To make the web site more useful to our users, we may offer
				some features in conjunction with third party providers that
				specialize in operating such services. For example, if you
				choose to subscribe to one of our magazines through our web
				site, we may forward your information to a third party for
				services such as credit card processing and order fulfillment.
				When you purchase a product through our web site, the
				information you provide about yourself may also be forwarded to
				other sites which are managed or operated by third parties.
				Third party internet sites and services accessible through the
				August Home web site have separate privacy and data collection
				practices, independent from us. August Home has no
				responsibility or liability for these independent policies or
				actions.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the event all or a portion of the assets owned or controlled
				by August Home or any parent subsidiary or affiliated entity
				are sold, assigned, transferred or acquired by another company,
				information from or about web site users may be among the
				transferred assets.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please be careful and responsible online. If you post personal
				information online that is accessible to the public, you may
				receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
				While we strive to protect your information, August Home cannot
				ensure or warrant the security of any information through the
				transmission process and you do so at your own risk.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you have questions or comments about this privacy policy,
				you may contact us at the above address or send an e-mail to
				<a href="mailto:orders@augusthome.com">orders@augusthome.com</a>.
