# Privacy Policy | WOOD TV8

**Privacy Policy**  
The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection practices of woodtv.com (“we” or “us”). Specifically, it outlines the types of information that we gather about you while you are using the woodtv.com web site (the “Site”) and the ways in which we use this information. This Privacy Policy, including our children’s privacy statement, does not apply to any information you may provide to us or that we may collect offline and/or through other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail).

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using the Site, you agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute over privacy, is governed by this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions. We may need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in the future, in which case we’ll post the changes to this Privacy Policy on the Site and update the Effective Date of the policy to reflect the date of the changes. By continuing to use the Site after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.

 **How We Collect and Use Information**  
We may collect and store personal or other information that you voluntarily supply to us online while using the Site (e.g., while on the Site or in responding via email to a feature provided on the Site).

We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate online through the Site. For example, we may collect information about your computer’s connection to the Internet, which allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on the Site. We also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a “cookie” to enhance your experience with the Site. Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site where you may have entered preference information before. The Site also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as “transparent GIFs”) to access cookies and to count users who visit the Site or open HTML-formatted email messages.

We use the information we collect from you while you are using the Site in a variety of ways, including using the information to customize features and advertising that appear on the Site. We also may provide your information to third parties, such as service providers, contractors, and advertisers, for a variety of purposes. We reserve the right to use, and to disclose to third parties, all of the information collected from and about you while you are using the Site in any way and for any purpose, including without limitation, to enable us or a third party to provide you with information about products and services.

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information available for viewing by third parties online – for example on message boards, web logs, through email, or in chat areas – that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides us. We cannot be responsible for any third-party use of such information.

Some of our third-party advertisers and ad servers that place and present advertising on the Site also may collect information from you via cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. These third-party advertisers and ad servers may use the information they collect to help present their advertisements, to help measure and research the advertisements’ effectiveness, or for other purposes. The use and collection of your information by these third-party advertisers and ad servers is governed by the relevant third-party’s privacy policy and is not covered by our Privacy Policy. Indeed, the privacy policies of these third-party advertisers and ad servers may be different from ours. If you have any concerns about a third party’s use of cookies or web beacons or use of your information, you should visit that party’s web site and review its privacy policy.

The Site also includes links to other web sites and provides access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control. When you access another web site or purchase third-party products or services through the Site, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or services.

Be aware that we may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law or to protect the rights, property or safety of users of the Site or the public or when we otherwise believe release is appropriate in our sole discretion.

Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the event that we sell some or all of our assets, or one or more of our web sites is acquired by another company, information about our users may be among the transferred assets. In the event of such a transfer, we cannot guarantee that this Privacy Policy will continue to govern your information.

We do not generally keep email correspondence, except for those emails that relate to the on-air programs or operations of WOOD TV8. As required by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), if any part of your email correspondence relates to station programming or operations, we must place such correspondence in the station's FCC Public Inspection File. Therefore, be informed that your personal information contained in certain emails, including personal information knowingly received from a child under the age of thirteen, will be disclosed to the general public, including, but not limited to, disclosure on the Site. We request that you not place any confidential personal information in your email correspondence to the station that pertains to station programming or operations. You understand and agree that we are not responsible for personal information that is disclosed in emails that are made available to the general public in compliance with FCC regulations.

 **Children’s Privacy Statement**  
This children’s privacy statement explains our practices with respect to the online collection and use of personal information from children under the age of thirteen, and provides important information regarding their rights under federal law with respect to such information.

The Site is not directed to children under the age of thirteen and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site. We screen users who wish to provide personal information in order to prevent users under the age of thirteen from providing such information. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen as part of the Site, we will delete such information from our records. If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site.

The provisions of this Privacy Policy relating to the collection and retention of the personal information of a child under the age of thirteen do not apply where such information was submitted as correspondence relating to station programming and operations.
