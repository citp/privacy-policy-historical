# Privacy Policy - Wool Warehouse - Buy Yarn, Wool, Needles & Other Knitting Supplies Online!

Privacy policies are generally quite long, pretty dull, but absolutely necessary – and have become especially pertinent since the introduction of the EU’s GDPR regulations in May 2018.

We take the security and privacy of your personal data extremely seriously, and our Privacy Policy contains details of how we handle that information.

You will find full details of our privacy policy on this page, but for a quick overview, we’ve put together a few of the more frequently asked questions with “plain English” answers below.

**FAQs**

**Does Wool Warehouse collect personal data?**

Yes.

**What personal data does Wool Warehouse collect?**

Primarily, we collect your name, address, email address and telephone number.

**Why does Wool Warehouse collect personal data?**

Quite simply, if we didn’t, we wouldn’t be able to process your order. We need your name and address so we know where to send your order. We need your email address and/or telephone number in order to contact you with your order confirmation, shipping confirmation, and to get in touch if there are any problems with your order.

**Do you share personal data with any third parties?**

Yes, as we have to do this in order to process your order. For example, we have to share your name and address with the payment processor (SagePay or PayPal) in order to accept and verify your payment. We have to share your contact details with the delivery company (Royal Mail, DPD or DHL) in order for them to be able to deliver your order. We also share your contact details with our email processors (Sparkpost and MailChimp) in order to send emails.

**Do you sell personal data to any third parties?**

Absolutely not!

**Do you send marketing emails?**

Yes – but only if you’ve given us your explicit consent. You will NOT be automatically added to our marketing list if you place an order, as we’ve always found that sort of practice to be a bit presumptuous. You will only be added to our marketing list if you tick the box to opt in, and you can opt-out at any point by clicking the unsubscribe link that we include on all our marketing emails.

**Do you engage in remarketing?**

Remarketing is the name given to those stalker-ish ads that follow you round on different websites. We find it a bit spooky, so we don’t do it.

**Can I access the personal data you hold?**

Yes, you can request that we tell you what personal data we hold. You may also request that we amend any incorrect data, and you may also request that we remove the personal data concerned.

Please note that if you follow a link to any of these websites, such websites will apply different terms to the collection and privacy of your personal data and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. When you leave our Site, we encourage you to read the privacy notice/policy of every website you visit.

**Customers**

We will collect details such as your name, address, phone number and email address when you order goods or services from us via our Site. We will use this information to process your order and comply with our contractual obligations.

In order to perform our contract with you, we may also need to share personal data with third parties such as payment providers and postal service organisations to assist in the delivery of goods or services you have ordered; this could include third party couriers or warranty providers.

We collect information about you in order to provide you with the goods and services you have requested from us. This information may also be used for internal record keeping, and to improve our products and services. We may use the information to customise the website according to your interests.

**If you fail to provide personal data**

Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide the data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example to provide you with our goods or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.

**Legal basis for processing your personal data**

We will only use your personal data where the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:

\- for performance of a contract we enter into with you;

\- where necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation we are subject to;

**Security**

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our Site; any transmission is at your own risk.

Information you provide to us is shared on our secure servers. We have implemented appropriate physical, technical and organisational measures designed to secure your information against accidental loss and unauthorised access, use, alteration or disclosure. In addition, we limit access to personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties that have a legitimate business need for such access.

**Credit Card Security**  
All credit/debit card payments from our website are made through the secure SagePay or Paypal gateways using industry standard 128-bit encryption. The transaction takes place electronically, eliminating the security risks associated with old methods of writing down and then manually inputting card details. As the payment is handled by SagePay or Paypal, we do not handle or store these details on our own servers at any point.

**Controlling your personal data**

It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if the personal data we hold about you changes.

Data protection legislation gives you the right to object to the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances or withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data where this has been provided. You also have the right to access information held about you and for this to be provided in an intelligible form.

If you would like a copy of some or all of your personal information, please write to us at Wool Warehouse, 12 Longfield Road, Sydenham Industrial Estate, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, CV31 1XB or email us at sales@woolwarehouse.co.uk.

You can also ask us to undertake the following:

\- update or amend your personal data if you feel this is inaccurate;

\- remove your personal data from our database entirely;

\- send you copies of your personal data in a commonly used format and transfer your information to another entity where you have supplied this to us, and we process this electronically with your consent or where necessary for the performance of a contract; or

\- restrict the use of your personal data.

We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and your right to access, and to provide you with the personal data that we hold about you or make your requested changes. Data protection legislation may allow or require us to refuse to provide you with access to some or all the personal data that we hold about you or to comply with any requests made in accordance with your rights referred to above. If we cannot provide you with access to your personal data, or process any other request we receive, we will inform you of the reasons why, subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions.

If you believe that any information we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, please write to us at Wool Warehouse, 12 Longfield Road, Sydenham Industrial Estate, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, CV31 1XB or email us at sales@woolwarehouse.co.uk.
