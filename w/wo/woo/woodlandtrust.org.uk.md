Should you wish to remove or not use cookies from our site you can learn how to do this below, however doing so will likely mean that our site will not work as you would expect.

**How long do cookies last?**

When a web server sends a cookie, it asks your browser to keep that particular cookie until a certain date and time. These dates can be:

  * Some date in the future - Might be a few minutes or a few hours from now (to track something like your shopping cart in an online store). The cookie might expire many years in the future, to keep track of your browser for a long time
  * When you close your browser - Called a session cookie, the next time you start your browser these will have vanished
  * Some date in the past - This is how the server asks a browser to remove a previously-stored cookie



**Our own cookies**

We use cookies to make our website work including:

  * Remembering if you have accepted our terms and conditions
  * Allowing you to add comments to our site
  * Remembering if we have already asked you certain questions (e.g. you declined to use our app or take our survey)



There is no way to prevent these cookies being set other than to not use our site.

**Site improvement cookies**

We regularly test new designs or site features on our sites. We may do this by showing slightly different versions of our websites to different people and anonymously monitoring how our site visitors respond to these different versions. Ultimately this helps us to offer you a better website experience.

**Anonymous visitor statistics cookies**

We use cookies to compile visitor statistics such as how many people have visited our website, what type of technology they are using, how long they spend on the site, what page they look at, etc. This helps us to continuously improve our website. These analytics programs also tell us, on an anonymous basis, how people reached this site (e.g. from a search engine) and whether they have been here before, helping us to to develop our services for you. Our site uses the following analytics programmes:

  * [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/)



**Advertising or Targeting cookies**

These types of cookies are used to deliver adverts which will be more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and to help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are normally placed by advertising networks with the Trust's permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Targeting or advertising cookies will often be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.

We use 'Advertising' cookies on Woodland Trust websites to:

  * Link to social networks, like Facebook, who may use information to provide targeted advertising to you on other websites
  * Used to identify that you have visited a Woodland Trust website, to show you relevant adverts from us
  * Provide advertising networks with information on your visit so that they can present you with adverts that you may be interested in



**Third party functions**

Our site, like most websites, includes functionality provided by third parties. A common example is an embedded YouTube video. Our site includes the following third part functions which use cookies:

  * [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/ "YouTube \(Opens in a new window\)")
  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ "Twitter \(Opens in a new window\)")



Disabling these cookies will likely break the functions offered by these third parties

**Social website cookies**

So you can easily "Like" or "Share" our content on social network sites, we have sharing buttons on our site from:

  * [AddThis](http://www.addthis.com/)



The privacy implications on this will vary from social network to social network and will be dependent on the privacy settings you have chosen on these networks.

**Turning Cookies off**

You can usually switch cookies off by adjusting your browser settings to stop it from accepting cookies. Doing so, however, will likely limit the functionality of ours and a large proportion of the world's websites as cookies are a standard part of most modern websites.

It may be that your concerns around cookies relate to so called "spyware". Rather than switching off cookies in your browser you may find that anti-spyware software achieves the same objective by automatically deleting cookies considered to be invasive.

**Notification of change of Privacy and cookie policy**
