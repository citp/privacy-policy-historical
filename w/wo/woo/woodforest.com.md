##  **Bank Safely Online!**

Internet banking security is a top priority at Woodforest. We utilize state of the art security to protect your information. We encourage you to remain aware of the potential for online fraud and to be prepared to react to any suspicious activity that puts your security at risk. We are providing you with the following information to help you protect yourself and keep your online banking information safe.

##  **Online Fraud**

The most common type of online fraud involves fraudulent emails sent to random email addresses for the purpose of stealing personal account and financial information, including online banking logon details. This practice is known as "phishing" or "spoofing".

Phishing criminals cast a very broad net by sending thousands of fraudulent emails to random email addresses, knowing that some of their targets will be among the recipients. In the process they end up sending email to many people who aren't customers.

These emails appear to be legitimate and try to entice you to disclose private information. This is done by asking you to reply directly to the email, or by asking you to follow a link within the email to log into an imitation website. Any details you provide may then be collected and used without your knowledge, including your user ID, password and account information.

It's important to note that a phishing attack does not involve a breach of Woodforest security. Phishing criminals rely on unsuspecting customers to reveal their personal account and financial information through fraudulent sources outside of Woodforest's secure online banking system

##  **Protect Yourself**
