It also describes the choices that certain individuals have regarding use, access, and correction of their personal data. 

We collect information about clients who contract with us for certain services (our “Customers”) and the end users of our Customers (“End Users”). This Policy describes how we collect, use, and share information provided to us by our Customers or their End Users (collectively, Customers and End Users are “you” throughout this Policy). Where there are distinctions in how we handle information of Customers or End Users, we will refer specifically to either Customers or End Users. It is important to understand that this Policy does not apply to our Customers’ collection, use, or sharing of End User data. To the extent that we collect or handle any data on behalf of our Customers, we do so at their instruction.

We are committed to subjecting all personal data received from EU member countries and Switzerland in reliance on each Privacy Shield Framework and the Privacy Shield principles of Notice; Choice; Accountability for Onward Transfer; Security; Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation; Access; and Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability (collectively, the “Principles”). To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and to view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s [Privacy Shield website](https://www.privacyshield.gov/). [https://www.privacyshield.gov] We collect, process, disclose, and transfer personal data from the EU member countries and Switzerland as described in this Policy.

Woopra, Inc. is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under each Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Woopra is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

We encourage individuals from the EU member countries and Switzerland who have questions or complaints about how we process their personal data under either Privacy Shield Framework to contact us directly at [privacy@woopra.com](mailto:privacy@woopra.com). We will work to resolve your issue as quickly as possible, but in any event no later than 45 days of receipt.

## Security

We have taken steps to help protect the personal data we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.

You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private.
