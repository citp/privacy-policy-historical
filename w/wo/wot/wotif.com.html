	<h2><a name="Q1"></a>What Information We Collect</h2>
	<p>In an effort to keep our service as simple and easy as possible, we do not create, use or store profiles of our customers. We only record PII and other information that we reasonably require to do business with you. On all Wotif pages that collect PII, we specifically describe what information is required in order to provide you with the product or service you request.</p>

	<p>We collect PII when you:</p>

	<ul class="spaced">
		<li><em>Make a booking</em><br>
			We collect your full name, email address and phone number each time you make a booking with Wotif.com. We will also collect credit card information, including card number, card type, security number, cardholder name and expiry date to pay for accommodation purchased through Wotif.com.</li>

        <li><em>Tick 'Remember my details for next time' on booking page</em><br>
            We retail your full name, email address, phone number, credit card type, and name on card when you tick 'Remember my details for next time' while making a booking.</li>

        <li><em>Shortlisted properties</em><br>
            We use cookies to add properties to your "Shortlist", so that you can access them easily in the future. Properties are added to your shortlist in two ways: when you actively choose to add them from a page on the site; or once you have completed the booking page and clicked <strong>Pay Now</strong>.<br>
            For more information on cookies, see the section below.</li>

		<li><em>Subscribe to our newsletter</em><br>
			Wotif collects email addresses from people who subscribe to the Wotif newsletter by either entering their email address in the "Newsletter" section of the site or by opting to be sent the newsletter at the time of making a booking.</li>

        <li><em>Surveys, promotions and competition information</em><br>
			Occasionally, We may offer site visitors or newsletter recipients an opportunity to participate in a survey, promotion or competition. The PII we collect when you participate in a survey, promotion or competition may include your full name, email address, telephone number and street address.</li>

		<li><em>Contact Wotif.com</em><br>
			We collect PII such as your full name, email address and/or telephone number whenever you submit an enquiry or suggestion, or request assistance with a booking through our Feedback pages.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Other information we collect:</p>

	<ul class="spaced">
		<li><em>Statistical information</em><br>
			When you visit our site, we record general information about your visit for statistical purposes. These statistics do not contain any PII. </li>

		<li><em>Cookies</em><br>
			We may, from time to time, use "cookies" to store your preferences, record session information and collect information on how you visit and access our web pages. We collect information on the web pages visited by our customers to help us continue to improve our services. <br><br>
			Cookies are pieces of information that our web page transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make the web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard and many websites use them to provide useful features for you. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify you, only your computer.<br><br>
            You can delete cookies from your computer at any time (see your internet browser's help menu for more information); however, this will remove all cookies and not just those associated with the Wotif.com site. You can individually remove a cookie that connects a property to your shortlist by clicking the remove option when the property appears in your shortlist.</li>
	</ul>


	<h2><a name="Q2"></a>How We Use Your Information</h2>

	<p>We use your PII only for the purpose of responding to and fulfilling your requests for our products and services. Information collected on the Wotif.com site may be used to:</p>

	<ul class="spaced">
		<li><em>Purchase Wotif.com products or services</em><br>
			Information collected when you purchase from us is used to charge your credit card and deliver your booking confirmation electronically. We may also contact you about your stay for customer service purposes or to make any changes or cancellations to your booking.</li>

		<li><em>Display your details when you next book with us</em><br>
			We will only display your details if you have ticked 'Remember my details for next time' while making a booking with us. This is done to reduce the information you need to type when you next make a booking. Your full name, email address, phone number, credit card type, and name on card are the only details stored when you select this option. We will also add any property you attempt to book to your shortlist for easier future access.</li>

		<li><em>Send newsletter email</em><br>
			We will only send newsletters to people that have opted in to receive them. Our newsletters provide information about the latest deals available on our website, and occassionally offer incentives for completing surveys or participating in competitions or promotions.</li>

        <li><em>Respond to your questions or suggestions</em><br>
			We will use your email address and/or telephone number to contact you when you submit a question or suggestion.</li>
	</ul>


	<h2><a name="Q3"></a>Who We Share Your Information With</h2>

	<p>We do not disclose any information about customer bookings to anyone except in the following circumstances:</p>

	<ul class="spaced">
		<li><em>Accommodation suppliers</em><br>
			We provide the guest name, telephone number and email address for each booking made to the relevant accommodation supplier. Our accommodation suppliers require this information for the booking and may use it if they need to contact you about the booking. Although we offer accommodation from reputable accommodation suppliers, we have not placed specific limitations on these suppliers from using or disclosing your information without your permission. Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any suppliers whose accommodation you purchase on our website. </li>

        <li><em>Legal obligations</em><br>
			We may be required by law to disclose information you provide us with for the purposes of obtaining products or services from Wotif.com. We may also disclose information against someone who poses a threat to our interests (such as customer fraud) or whose activities could cause harm to others.</li>
	</ul>


	<h2><a name="Q4"></a>How You Control and Access Your Information</h2>

	<p>We believe that site visitors and customers should have control over the collection and use of their PII. Here's how you can control and have access to your information:</p>

	<ul class="spaced">
        <li><em>Newsletter subscription and unsubscription</em><br>
			If at any time you would like to either change your email address with us or unsubscribe from our newsletter you can:
			<ol>
				<li>Go to the "Newsletter" section of our site from the home page and follow the instructions to change your email address or unsubscribe; or </li>
				<li>Send an email to <a href="mailto:newsletter@wotif.com?subject=[newsletter%20subscription%20changes]">newsletter@wotif.com</a> advising that you would like to unsubscribe or change your email address. Be sure to include details of your old and new email addresses for changes.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>

        <li><em>Booking information</em><br>
			If at any time you would like to alter the PII you provided us in your booking, please <a href="/ContactUs.jsp">contact us</a>.</li>

		<li><em>Remember my details for next time</em><br>
			If at any time you would like us to stop remembering your details for the next time you book, untick "Remember my details for next time" the next time you make a booking, or <a href="/ContactUs.jsp">contact us</a>.</li>

		<li><em>General</em><br>
			If at any time you want to enquire about any of your PII that we store, please <a href="/ContactUs.jsp">contact us</a>.</li>
	</ul>


	<h2><a name="Q5"></a>How We Protect Your Information</h2>

	<p>To ensure the confidentiality of your PII, we use leading security technology and procedures that are regularly reviewed and updated. </p>

	<p>We have also obtained a digital certificate from Thawte Server CA (part of the VeriSign group), an industry leader in the protection and management of data transmission.</p>

	<p>Our systems are configured with industry standard data encryption and firewall technology. When you send PII to us over the Internet, your data is protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure safe transmission. </p>
