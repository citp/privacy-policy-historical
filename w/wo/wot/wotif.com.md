Our newsletters provide information about deals which are deemed to be valuable to our customers, and will occasionally offer incentives for completing surveys or participating in competitions or promotions.

For Wotif flights bookings we may also provide to the airline other relevant information collected from you. Our suppliers require this information for the booking and may use it if they need to contact you about the booking. Although we offer accommodation and flights from reputable suppliers, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any supplier whose services you book on our website. 
  * Service providers We work with online payment gateway and fraud detection providers to enable secure credit card transactions on Wotif.com. We provide credit card information (where applicable) relating to bookings to enable them to process and screen the payment on our behalf.

They are not permitted to use your email address or share personal information for any other purpose.
