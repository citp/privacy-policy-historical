### Additional Information About Our Use of Tracking Technologies and Interest-Based Advertising

FULLBEAUTY Brands relies on partners to provide many features of our FULLBEAUTY Brands Websites and services using data about your use of the FULLBEAUTY Brands and other sites. We use cookies for the following purposes:

  * **Website Operations** : Enabling features that are necessary for providing you the services on our FULLBEAUTY Brands Websites, such as identifying you as being signed in, tracking content views, remembering your preferences and the number of times you have been shown an advertisement.
  * **Analytics** : Allowing us to understand how our services are being used, track website performance and make improvements.
  * **Personalized Advertising** : Delivering tailored advertising based on your preferences or interests across services and devices and measuring the effectiveness of ads.
  * **Social Media** : Enabling the sharing of content from our services through social networking and other websites.



Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to disable or reject cookies. If you delete your cookies or if you set your browser to decline cookies, some features of the Services may not be available, work, or work as designed. You may also be able to opt out of or block tracking by interacting directly with the third-parties who conduct tracking through our Services.

You can learn more about ad serving companies and the options available to limit their collection and use of your information by visiting the websites for the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1), the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN), and the [European Interactive Digital Advertising Initiative](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). Similarly, you can learn about your options to opt-out of mobile app tracking by certain advertising networks through your device settings and by resetting the advertiser ID on your Apple or Android device. 

Please note that opting-out of advertising networks services does not mean that you will not receive advertising while using our Services or on other websites, nor will it prevent the receipt of interest-based advertising from third parties that do not participate in these programs. It will, however, exclude you from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks, as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms. If you delete your cookies, you may also delete your opt-out preferences.

Your browser or device may include "Do Not Track" functionality. At this time, FULLBEAUTY Brands does not respond to browser "Do Not Track" signals.
