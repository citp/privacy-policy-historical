We use the information we collect from our website visitors, in order to provide you with more meaningful editorial and advertising content and to offer you relevant products and services, as well as to maintain, protect and improve your overall experience. In particular, you may choose (i) to subscribe to any of our electronic newsletters or (ii) to receive “special offers” by EMI and its various service providers, (iii) to receive franchise and business opportunity information from selected advertisers, (iv) to submit questions or comments in response to editorial content on our website, or (v) to purchase books and related publications offered on our affiliated website at _bookstore.entrepreneur.com_ (the “Bookstore Website”). In each of those instances you will be asked to provide, and we will collect and store, certain personal information such as email address, zip code, telephone number, and in some instances information about your business. In the case of purchases made through the Bookstore Website, we will also collect and store additional information about those purchases, including titles purchased, quantity and dates of purchases, the method of payment, and other information provided such as billing and shipping addresses (if different). By providing that information, you agree that it can be used by EMI and its various advertisers and other service providers to send you promotions and other communications concerning business opportunities, products or services. You can remove yourself from any such electronic newsletters and otherwise stop receiving any further promotions and other commercial communications by following the “unsubscribe” directions included with each newsletter or, in all of the above instances, by sending an email with the word “unsubscribe” in the subject line to _unsubscribe@entrepreneur.com._   

We may use the name you provide for your EMI Profile across all of the services we offer that require a EMI Account, which is where the information you provide is maintained. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your EMI Account, so that you are represented consistently across all our services.

When you contact EMI, we keep a record of your communications to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about the products and services offered through our website, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements. 

We use information collected from cookies ****and other technologies, like ** _pixel tags_** _,_ to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. You can reset your browser to reject all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. But you need to know that you may not be able to access or use some features and services on our website without cookies. A **_pixel tag_**  is a type of technology which is placed on a website or within an email and used for the purpose of tracking activity on a website and is often used in combination with cookies.

**4.   _The Advertising on Our Website_.**

Advertising on our website makes it possible for us to offer you the information and products/services free of charge. We take seriously and make every effort to make sure that that advertising is safe, unobtrusive and as relevant as possible. 

Cookies are used to make that advertising as relevant as possible to the needs and interests of our website visitors, and more valuable to our advertisers in being able to show our visitors more relevant ads. Cookies are also used to avoid you seeing the same ad multiple times and to detect and prevent click fraud. We use AdSense, Google Analytics and other DoubleClick services (collectively, “Google® Services”), which help us manage and improve our website and help our advertisers better understand and track user interaction with their ads. When you visit a location on our website which includes one or more of these ads, various cookies may be sent to your browser. 

We may use other technologies, including Flash and HTML5, which provide the functionality for such displays as interactive advertising. We may also use your IP address to select and provide advertising targeted to that address, in order to improve the relevance of the ads you see and to measure and report to advertisers non-personal statistical information about geographical location of those website visitors who are viewing their ads.

The advertising you see on our website is determined by a number of factors relating to relevance, including (i) your approximate geographical location base on you IP address and (ii) the subject matter you may be viewing on our website. For example, if you are viewing an article about physical health, you may see ads concerning exercise equipment.

However, it is important to understand that many of the services we provide on our website and to our website visitors may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. .
