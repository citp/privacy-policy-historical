            <h4><strong>What are cookies? Why do we use them? </strong></h4>
            <h4>Cookies are very tiny text files that are stored on your computer when you   visit certain web pages that record your preferences. WoWMine.com uses   cookies to keep track of what you have in your shopping cart and to remember you   when you return to our store. They cannot harm your computer and they do not   contain any personal or private information. You must accept cookies to shop at   WoWMine.com. </h4>
            <h4><strong>How do we protect information we collect? </strong></h4>
            <h4>We offer secure web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and   we store certain kinds of data in encrypted form. We follow reasonable technical   and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and   integrity of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely   secure, we believe the measures implemented by our web site reduce the   likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data   involved. WoWMine.com's servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an   encryption technology that works with Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet   Explorer, and AOL's browser, so that only WoWMine.com can read a   customer's personal information. </h4>
            <h4><strong>How long do we keep user information? </strong></h4>
            <h4>We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives for as long as   we reasonably need it. We may alter this practice according to changing   requirements. For example, we may delete some data if needed to free up storage   space. We may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it. In   addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain   indefinitely. <br>

                <br>
              Data management requests are administered in an orderly   manner to the extent feasible and within our direct control. Note: we have   greater control over recently collected data than for archived data. Once data   is removed from the system and archived, it may not be feasible to accommodate   specific requests. In those cases, our general data retention policy applies. </h4>
