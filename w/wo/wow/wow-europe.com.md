Some of Blizzard’s products, services and features require that we share information with other users, our partners and service providers, or for legal reasons or in the event of a dispute.

  1. **With partners and service providers.** Blizzard may provide information to its vendors, consultants, marketing partners, research firms and other service providers or business partners.

## 6\. International Transfer

Your personal data will be transferred to and processed in the [United States] where many of our central databases operate.

Where we share data with vendors, we use these clauses, an appropriate Privacy Shield certification or a vendor's Processor Binding Corporate Rules to protect your data.

These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites or apps, tracking users’ movements around the websites or apps and gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual, as well as an aggregated, basis.

We use this technology for various purposes, including our shopping cart, maintenance of user settings (e.g. language preference) and authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use some of the features or areas of our websites may be limited.

We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. For this reason, these types of clear gifs are tied to personal data.

We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies and Local Storage such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

We partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our websites or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. Some of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads. If you wish not to have your information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the [DAA's Consumer Choice page](http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN) and/or the [NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1).

Please also note that we strive to adhere to the [DAA's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising](https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/sites/aboutads/files/DAA_files/seven-principles-07-01-09.pdf).

## 10\. What are Internet Protocol addresses?

An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your computer. Blizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused. See tracking technology discussion above.

## 11\. What level of security is applied to your personal information?

To help protect the privacy of the data and personally identifiable information you provide to us and that we learn from you, we maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards.

## 12\. Note to Parents

We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information about children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers without permission when they are on-line.

Once a child states that his/her age is under 16, he or she will be unable to register an account with us. We do not knowingly collect or store any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 16. If parents believe that we have unintentionally collected their children’s personal information, they may request the deletion of the information by contacting us at [EU-Privacy@Blizzard.com](mailto:eu-privacy@blizzard.com).

Blizzard has engineered Parental Controls to help parents monitor and limit, if necessary, the amount of time their children spend interacting with our games. For more information, you may visit our Parental Controls area at [BattleNet Support](https://eu.battle.net/support/article/32243).

## 13\. Further Information or Complaints

If you have questions or concerns regarding data protection at Blizzard, you may contact our Data Protection Officer by writing to [DPO@Blizzard.com](mailto:dpo@blizzard.com).

Each EU Member State shall provide one or more independent public authority (ies) to be responsible for monitoring the application of the GDPR in order to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to processing and to facilitate the free flow of personal data within the Union (‘supervisory authority’). If you feel that Blizzard has violated your rights, or if you wish to raise a concern with the data protection authorities, please contact the supervisory authority in the country where you live, work, or where you believe a breach of data protection law has occurred.
