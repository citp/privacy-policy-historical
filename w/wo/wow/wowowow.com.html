Privacy Policy<br>
<br>
The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection practices of The Women on The Net Inc.. We have developed this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to protecting any information we gather about you while you are using wowowow.com. The Policy describes the type of information we collect from you, how that information may be used and shared and what steps are taken to protect it. Please carefully review our information collection practices and privacy protections below.<br>
<strong><br>
Publicly Shared Information</strong><br>
<br>
Certain areas of our site contain information supplied by visitors and others. wowowow.com is not responsible for comments, advice, information, or any other posting made by visitors or others in these areas. We reserve the right to review materials posted in any public areas and to delete or edit them, for any reason, at any time.<br>
<strong><br>
Information You Provide to Us</strong><br>
<br>
The only personal information this website obtains about you is information voluntarily provided by you through our website. This means that it is possible to visit and navigate through our site without giving us personally identifiable information. To contribute comments, images, multimedia or other content to the site you must register. When registering you will be required to provide us with a limited amount of personal information such as your name and e-mail address.<br>
<br>
During registration and at other times while using the site you may also be asked to provide us with additional information such as gender, salary/income, postal address, etc. This additional information is entirely voluntary.<br>
<br>
<strong>Information that is Automatically Collected</strong><br>
<br>
We collect information about our readers as a group through standard analysis of our web server log files. This information may include your computer’s <span class="caps">IP</span> address, information about your web browser and operating system and the pages you visit.<br>
<br>
In addition, we will also track basic usage information such as click patterns, referring/exit pages, browser identification and clickstream information through web analytics software.<br>
<br>
Third party advertisers or ad servers that place advertising on the site may also collect information from you via cookies, web beacons or gifs. The use and collection of your information by these third parties is governed by their third party privacy policy and is not covered by, and may differ from this privacy policy.<br>
<strong><br>
Required Disclosures</strong><br>
<br>
We may need to disclose your personally identifiable information when required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. You authorize us to disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.<br>
<br>
<strong>Use of Personal Information</strong><br>
<br>
We use the information we collect from you in a variety of ways, including using it to customize features and advertising that appear on the site as well as newsletters sent to your email address. When you provide us with your personal registration information you may have the option of informing us that you would like to receive promotional offers from us and/or third parties. This selection authorizes us and third parties to use the information that we collect online from you while you are using the site in order to send promotional offers directly to you. If you choose to receive these promotional offers, your information may be used for direct mail or email marketing.<br>
<br>
You should understand that information you provide through the registration process or post to the public areas of our website or through the use of our platform may be accessible by, and made public through, syndication programs and by search engines, metasearch tools, crawlers, metacrawlers and other similar programs.<br>
<br>
Certain areas of our website allow you to post information about yourself and communicate with others, as well as post reviews and upload content. Such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. When you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available.<br>
<br>
<strong>Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
<br>
We use this information to evaluate use of the site and to determine which areas we need to improve. By evaluating usage patterns, demographic, interests and general behavior, we are able to better understand and serve you. This information is used exclusively in aggregate form and is not directly linked to personally identifiable information. This non-personal information will include data such as how many persons visited a particular page or activity, the length of their visit, the average age of our visitors on the site or page, income distribution, or the preferences of our visitors.<br>
<br>
<strong>Use of Cookies and Tracking Devices</strong><br>
<br>
This site uses cookies or other tracking devices. Cookies do not allow the website to access personal information that you haven’t already provided. Cookies enable us to track how often visitors are visiting our website and specific pages, the number of entries in specific events, the estimated audience size for sponsors and advertisers, and user preferences. You can refuse to use cookies by turning them off in your browser.<br>
<br>
This site also uses clear GIFs [Graphics Interchange Format] to gather information on visits to our website, track usage of website links and e-mails. We do not disclose personal information that may be linked to our <span class="caps">GIF</span> tracking practices to third parties.<br>
<br>
<strong>Use and Collection of Information by Advertisers and Sponsors</strong><br>
<br>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our site. These advertising companies may collect and use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address or other personal information) about your visits to our site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.<br>
<br>
Our website contains advertisements, including banner ads and/or links to the websites of advertisers or sponsors. These entities may independently solicit and collect personal information, or send their own cookies to our visitors. Please be advised that when you link to or visit an advertiser’s, sponsor’s or others’ website, we may frame the site with our website logo. It is important that you understand that you will be subject to the privacy policy and terms of usage agreement of that website operator when you click on a link to their site. We will not be responsible for advertiser or sponsor ads and/or links or the content, activities, information collection, use and disclosure practices of the websites of advertisers and sponsors.<br>
<br>
<strong>Third Party Advertising</strong><br>
<br>
The advertisements appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by 24/7 Real Media, our Web advertising partner. Information about your visits to this site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you. For more information about 24/7 Real Media, cookies, and how to "opt-out", please click <a href="http://www.247realmedia.com/EN-US/privacy-policy.html">here</a>.<br>
<br>
<strong>Children’s Privacy Statement</strong><br>
<br>
This site is not directed to children under the age of thirteen and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen as part of the site, we will delete the information from our records.<br>
<br>
Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen, we also do not knowingly distribute such information to third parties. We also do not knowingly allow children under the age of thirteen to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information through the site.<br>
<br>
<strong>Our Security Procedures<br>
</strong><br>
We take measures to protect the privacy of all information collected over our website. Only employees and supervisors with specific authorization have access to databases containing visitors’ personal information if provided. The databases are protected in a secure facility hosted by Rackspace. For information about Rackspace’s security policies please click <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/downloads/pdfs/RackspaceSecurityApproach.pdf">here</a>.<br>
<br>
We will review our security measures and Privacy Policy on a periodic basis and we may modify our policies as we deem appropriate. We may also change or update our Privacy Policy if we add new services or features and will post these changes in this policy. We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy on a regular basis.<br>
<br>
