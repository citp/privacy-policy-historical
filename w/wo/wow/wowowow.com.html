<p>The following Privacy Policy governs the online information  collection practices of The Women on The Net Inc.. We have developed  this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to protecting any  information we gather about you while you are using wowowow.com. The  Policy describes the type of information we collect from you, how that  information may be used and shared and what steps are taken to protect  it. Please carefully review our information collection practices and  privacy protections below.<br>
<strong><br>
Publicly Shared Information</strong></p>
<p>Certain areas of our site contain information supplied by visitors and  others. wowowow.com is not responsible for comments, advice,  information, or any other posting made by visitors or others in these  areas. We reserve the right to review materials posted in any public  areas and to delete or edit them, for any reason, at any time.<br>
<strong><br>
Information You Provide to Us</strong></p>
<p>The only personal information this website obtains about you is  information voluntarily provided by you through our website. This means  that it is possible to visit and navigate through our site without  giving us personally identifiable information. To contribute comments,  images, multimedia or other content to the site you must register. When  registering you will be required to provide us with a limited amount of  personal information such as your name and e-mail address.</p>
<p>During registration and at other times while using the site you may also  be asked to provide us with additional information such as gender,  salary/income, postal address, etc. This additional information is  entirely voluntary.</p>
<p><strong>Information that is Automatically Collected</strong></p>
<p>We collect information about our readers as a group through standard  analysis of our web server log files. This information may include your  computer’s IP address, information about your web browser and operating system and the pages you visit.</p>
<p>In addition, we will also track basic usage information such as click  patterns, referring/exit pages, browser identification and clickstream  information through web analytics software.</p>
<p>Third party advertisers or ad servers that place advertising on the site  may also collect information from you via cookies, web beacons or gifs.  The use and collection of your information by these third parties is  governed by their third party privacy policy and is not covered by, and  may differ from this privacy policy.<br>

You authorize us to disclose any  information about you to law enforcement or other government officials  as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We use the information we collect from you in a variety of ways,  including using it to customize features and advertising that appear on  the site as well as newsletters sent to your email address. When you  provide us with your personal registration information you may have the  option of informing us that you would like to receive promotional offers  from us and/or third parties. This selection authorizes us and third  parties to use the information that we collect online from you while you  are using the site in order to send promotional offers directly to you.  If you choose to receive these promotional offers, your information may  be used for direct mail or email marketing.</p>
<p>You should understand that information you provide through the  registration process or post to the public areas of our website or  through the use of our platform may be accessible by, and made public  through, syndication programs and by search engines, metasearch tools,  crawlers, metacrawlers and other similar programs.</p>
<p>Certain areas of our website allow you to post information about  yourself and communicate with others, as well as post reviews and upload  content. Such postings may appear on other websites or when searches  are executed on the subject of your posting. When you voluntarily  disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that  information will be publicly available.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>We use this information to evaluate use of the site and to determine  which areas we need to improve. By evaluating usage patterns,  demographic, interests and general behavior, we are able to better  understand and serve you.

<p>This site uses cookies or other tracking devices. Cookies do not allow  the website to access personal information that you haven’t already  provided. Cookies enable us to track how often visitors are visiting our  website and specific pages, the number of entries in specific events,  the estimated audience size for sponsors and advertisers, and user  preferences.
