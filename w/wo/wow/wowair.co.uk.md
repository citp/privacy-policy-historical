## 2\. What do we mean by personal data and data processing?

When we use the term “personal data” in this Privacy Policy, we mean any information relating to you and through which you can be identified, directly or indirectly, or in combination with other information that we may hold. Personal data may include all sorts of things, for example, your name, phone number, email address, payment details, information relating to your travel itinerary (e.g. your booking reference number) or information on how you use our website and app or how you otherwise interact with us.

When we use the term “processing” of personal data, we mean any operation or set of operations performed on personal data, whether or not by automated means. All actions carried out on personal data, from collection and storage to alteration, use or disclosure thus constitute ‘processing’, e.g. we process your personal data when you change your booking or otherwise seek other support from us or when we send you newsletters or offers based on your preferences. 

 _To sum up…_

 _Personal data is data you can be identified from and data processing is us using the data in one way or another.   _

## 3\. What personal data do we collect?

The types of personal data that we collect will depend on our relationship with you, the circumstances of collection and the type of service you request from us. The personal data we collect and process may include: 

Your name, e-mail address, phone number, postal address and contact details. Additional information may be requested, such as information concerning your passport, date of birth, your gender, the number and type of your travel document (passport), its expiry date and country of issue.
