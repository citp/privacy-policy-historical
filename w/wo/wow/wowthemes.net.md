Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party links on our website. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. We are not responsible for the content of any linked website and cannot take responsibility for the consequences of your using the information or services on linked websites. We cannot guarantee that these links will work all of the time. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

WowThemes.net creates free and premium themes, templates, plugins and scripts. The products usually have a website demo assigned. Demos are hosted on various domains which we own. The current privacy policy applies, except no personal data is used.

We store data via contact forms, subscribe forms, comments but we never use them. Product demo websites have no real purpose other than introducing a product’s design and/or functionality. We assume you are only testing the functionality of that specific product while submitting the forms thus we never use your data in response. However, you can of course exercise your [GDPR rights](https://web.archive.org/privacy-policy/#your-rights).

## **Third-Party Disclosure**

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information. We may also release information when its release is appropriate to comply with and forced by the law.

No method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and we are unable to guarantee the absolute security of the Personal Information we have collected from you.

If our Website experiences a data breach we will immediately communicate this to those users affected by the breach. A notification will be sent within 72 hours to all affected users.

## **How can you exercise your rights?**

[Contact us here](https://wowthemes.net/support) with your GDPR request. Our ticket form has a special field called “GDPR Requests”, make sure you select it before submitting.

In most circumstances, our Company will provide subjects with a copy of the information they request free of charge. However, we are permitted to charge a “reasonable fee” when a request is manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive.

The fee must be based on the administrative cost of providing the information.

An alternative solution for excessive, unfounded or repetitive requests is to refuse to comply. In such case we will explain to the individual why we’re refusing to comply, and let them know of their right to appeal to the organisation’s supervisory authority.

## **California Online Privacy Protection Act**

## **COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)**

When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.
