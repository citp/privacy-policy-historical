# Privacy | Wowza Media Systems

**What information does Wowza gather/track about you?**  
Wowza requires that you supply personal information, including name, company, telephone number and email address, prior to receiving license keys and other specific corporate and informational materials. Wowza also logs IP addresses, Web browser information, referral information, and pages visited for the purposes of improving both the navigation and marketing of the website.

Wowza is the sole owner of the information collected on the Wowza website, and will not sell or rent this information to anyone.

**What does Wowza do with the information it gathers?**

Wowza or it representatives will often follow up, either by email, phone or mail with people who have filled out forms and requested license keys or other information from our website.  Using the email addresses provided at registration, Wowza periodically sends promotional email about new products, product enhancements and special offers. Upon written request, Wowza will remove your personal information from our database, or allow you to "opt out" of further contact or change/correct personal information that you state is erroneous.

**With whom does Wowza share the information it gathers/tracks?**  
Wowza does not release personal information about any individual subscriber to outside third parties other than authorized third party e-commerce providers. Wowza does share personal information with our resellers, distributors, global offices and authorized third party e-commerce providers for the purpose of providing our customers with high quality, localized service. This process may include sending your personal information gathered through forms on the website across international borders.  Wowza’s third party e-commerce providers do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes beyond filling your Wowza software product order.

**What are Wowza’s security measures for information it gathers and tracks?**  
Wowza takes precautions to protect your information.  When you submit sensitive information on the Wowza website your information is protected both online and offline.  Whenever we collect sensitive information, such as credit card data, that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way.  You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your webbrowser, or looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the web page.  While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline.  Only employees or other authorized third party representatives who need the information to perform a specific job, such as billing or customer service, are granted access to personally identifiable information.  The computers and servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
