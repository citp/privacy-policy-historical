We’re committed to keeping your personal data secure and have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

To help us keep your personal information secure you should:

  * Keep your password and any account details secret;
  * Never distribute the URL’s for pages that you have looked at while logged in as a registered customer.



### INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

To deliver products and services to you, it is sometimes necessary for Wolseley to share your data outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It will be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. We will only do this if there are appropriate safeguards in place to make sure your personal data receives the same protection as when it is being processed inside the EEA. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.

### INTERNET

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to us over the internet or to our website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

### YOUR RIGHTS

You have legal rights relating to your personal data. You can get more information on each of the rights we’ve summarised below by taking a look at the glossary in the bottom section of this privacy notice:

  * The right to request access to your personal data.
  * The right to request correction of your personal data.
  * The right to request erasure of your personal data.
  * The right to object to processing of your personal data or to withdraw consent. **Remember, you can always stop direct marketing messages by clicking on an unsubscribe link in any of our emails or getting in touch via email, phone or post.**
  * The right to request restriction of processing your personal data.
  * The right to request a transfer of your personal data to another service provider.



If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above or if you have any questions or a complaint, please contact us at:  
Data Privacy Officer   
Wolseley UK Limited   
2 Kingmaker Court   
Warwick Technology Park

E-mail: [ dataprivacyofficer@wolseley.co.uk ](mailto:dataprivacyofficer@wolseley.co.uk?subject=Website%20Privacy%20policy)

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. We will do our best to respond to legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

### GLOSSARY

We recognise that some of the privacy law terminology can be a bit complicated, so we have set out below some further detail on some of the terms used in this policy:

### LAWFUL BASIS:

**Legitimate Interest** means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).

**Performance of Contract** means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract. For example, where we are sending you a product you have purchased from us or where you have entered a competition on our website, we will be processing your personal data on the basis that it is necessary for us to do so in order to perform a contract between us. 

**Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation** means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.

###  YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS:

You have the right to:

  * Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
  * Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
  * Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
  * Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
  * Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
  * Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
  * Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.



Security

Wolseley UK will use its best endeavours to protect the information you provide. Access to your information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. The servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.

  * Keep your password secret

    * advertisers and advertising networks that require the data to select and serve relevant adverts to you and others. We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we will provide them with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in SW1). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience;
    * analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our site;
    * credit reference agencies for the purpose of assessing your credit score where this is a condition of us entering into a contract with you.

  * If Wolseley UK or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.

WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA

[The data that we collect from you will be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA").

We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

YOUR RIGHTS

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes.
