**SECURITY** OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Whether you are shopping online or in our stores, we use reasonable security measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information under our control and appropriately limit access to it. Best Buy cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us by e-mail, and you do so at your own risk. 

**_Safe Shopping Policy on BestBuy.com_**

We use a variety of information security measures to protect your online transactions with us. The Best Buy Web site uses encryption technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to protect your personal information during data transport. SSL protects information you submit via our Web site such as ordering information including your name, address and credit card number. Information you provide to us via our in-store kiosk does not traverse the public Internet. 

**_Choosing a Personal Password on BestBuy.com_**

When you create an account on BestBuy.com you are required to establish a password. To maximize your level of protection, you should choose at least 6-30 characters, using a combination of both letters and numbers. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and account information.

**COOKIES, CLICKSTREAM TECHNOLOGY, THIRD PARTY AD PROVIDERS AND INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING**

_**Cookies**_

A cookie is a small data file that a Web site or an e-mail may save to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive. Our Web sites and e-mails use cookies to create a more personalized shopping experience for visitors to our site. Cookies simulate a continuous connection — they let us "remember" information about your preferences and session, and allow you to move within areas of our Web sites without reintroducing yourself. 

Best Buy uses a third party to place cookies on your computer to collect non-personally identifiable information. Although our cookies may contain a unique user ID, they do not collect or store any personally identifiable information. However, you do have the option of saving your RewardZone membership ID in the cookie so it is easy to remember next time; this option will be found under My Account. 

You may choose to set your Web browser to not accept cookies. However, without enabling your cookies, you will not be able to view, create an account, or make purchases on the Best Buy Web site. 

_**Clickstream Technology**_

Our Web server automatically collects clickstream information such as the address (or URL) of the Web site that you came from before visiting our site, which pages you visit on our site, which browser you used to view our site and any search terms you may have entered on our site, among other things. 

Our Web site may also use other technologies to track which pages our visitors view. This anonymous clickstream data provides our customers with a better shopping experience and helps Best Buy understand how visitors use our Web site. 

_**Third Party Ad Providers and Interest-Based Advertising**_

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site or other sites across the Internet. These companies may use anonymous information (not including your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites. We may also share anonymous information with these companies in aggregate form. In either case, the purpose of the sharing is to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you, analyzing and improving the effectiveness of ads and e-mails, and improving and enhancing our site and its content. 

To learn more about interest-based advertising and your privacy, including opting out of such advertising, visit our partner's site [Atlas Solutions](http://www.atlasdmt.com/privacy/). We may partner with other companies to provide interest-based advertising, both on and off BestBuy.com. In these situations, we will notify you of the advertising and give you the opportunity to opt-out of these activities.
