# Privacy Policy

Wolfram Research understands your concerns about how personally identifying information is used and shared, and we endeavor to use such information carefully and sensibly. 

The information we obtain from site participants and visitors helps us enhance and refine our service and content. In addition to information that you provide to us voluntarily, we also receive information whenever you interact with our websites (such as your IP address, connection information, browser type, and so forth). 

Information about our users is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. If you opt to allow us to share your information, we will do so only with Wolfram Research partners who also respect privacy concerns. 

If you choose to receive communication from Wolfram Research, we may send you email describing special offers or services. If at any time you want to stop receiving communication from us, please [unsubscribe](http://www.wolfram.com/unsubscribe/). 

We may release personally identifying information when we believe release is appropriate in order to comply with law; enforce our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20071216014054id_/http%3A//www.wolfram.com/company/terms.html) and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Wolfram Research, our users, or others. 

When you visit our Websites, we, like most Websites, send one or more cookies--small anonymous identifiers--to your computer that uniquely identify your browser. While we do use cookies for security and fraud investigation purposes, our primary purpose is to enhance your user experience by understanding and remembering your preferences, and by general tracking of our user trends. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or to notify you when a cookie is sent. Please be aware that some of our features and services may not have full functionality if your browser refuses cookies. 

We may update or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time in the future. Any such updates or modifications shall be effective immediately upon their posting. Please refer back to this page often for the latest information.
