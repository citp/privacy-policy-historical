            Children should always get permission from their parents before sending 
            any information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, 
            and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. We

            TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b><br>
            The information we gather falls into two categories: (1) information 
            voluntarily supplied by visitors to our websites, and (2) tracking 
            information gathered as visitors navigate through our sites. Third 
            party providers featured on or linked to by our websites, such as 
            vendors of products and services offered through our sites, may be 
            gathering the same kinds of information. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>User 
            Supplied Information</b>. To make use of certain features on our websites 
            (such as comment forms or opinion surveys) visitors may need to provide 
            certain information, for example, your name, email address, sex, age, 
            home address or zip code, and we might request information on your 
            interest in sports, personal finance, the performing arts, and the 
            like. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From 
            time to time, we may offer contests, sweepstakes or other promotions 
            on our sites. If you enter one of these promotions, you'll have to 
            provide information about yourself (such as your name, address, telephone 
            number and email address) so that we can contact you if you win. We 
            may share this information with any co-sponsor of the promotion, which 
            we will identify in the official rules. If you don't want us to collect 
            the information requested in the registration form or to provide it 
            to contest co-sponsors, please do not enter the contest or sweepstakes.

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Cookies.</b> 
            To help make our sites more responsive to the needs of our visitors, 
            we invoke a standard feature of browser software, called a "cookie," 
            to assign each visitor a unique, random number, a sort of user ID, 
            if you will, that resides on your computer. The cookie doesn't actually 
            identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access 
            our site. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself, we won't know 
            who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only 
            personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. 
            A cookie can't read unrelated data off your hard drive. Our advertisers 
            and the third parties that provide products or services through our 
            sites may also assign their own cookies to your browser, a process 
            that we don't control. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
            use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs, to deliver a 
            better, more personalized service. For example, we use cookies to 
            avoid showing you the same ad, repeatedly, during a single visit. 
            In addition, we may use cookies to track the pages on our sites visited 
            by our users. We can build a better site if we know which pages our 
            users are visiting and how often. Of course, you can set your browser 
            not to accept cookies, but if you do, you may not be able to take 
            advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other visitors to 
            our sites. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Other 
            Tracking Tools. </b>Our web pages may contain electronic images (called 
            "single-pixel GIFs" or "web beacons") that allow 
            us and our vendors to count users who have visited particular pages 
            or to access certain cookies. We may use these tools and other technologies 
            to recognize which pages users visit, and which links they click on. 
            We may also be able to track your online purchases from us or from 
            third party sites that have agreed to share such information with 
            us. </font></p>

            lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data 
            -- such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify 
            you personally to us. We use this information to deliver our web pages

            Chat, email newsletters and free email services, for example, may 
            be made available through cooperative arrangements with providers 
            that specialize in operating such services. In some instances, these 
            third party providers will have the same access to your information

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sites 
            to Which We Link. </b>Of course, our sites include links to plenty 
            of other websites, and provide access to products and services offered 
            by third parties, whose privacy policies we don't control. When you 
            access another website or purchase products or services or conduct 
            other transactions through our websites, use of any information you 
            provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site 
            you're visiting or the provider of such products or services. And 
            when you provide information in the course of obtaining products or 
            services through one of our sites, use of any information you provide 
            may be governed by the privacy policy of the provider of those products 
            or services, even if it appears that you're on WTOV-TV-branded pages 
            throughout the transaction. The provider's privacy policy may differ 
            from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of our provider 
            partners via a link either from the site's homepage or from the pages

            Advertisers. When we present information to our advertisers -- to 
            help them understand our audience and confirm the value of advertising 
            on our websites -- it is usually in the form of aggregated statistics 
            on traffic to various pages within our sites. From time to time, we 
            may share more particularized information on visitors to our sites 
            with those marketing products and services that we believe may be 
            of interest to you. <br>
            Statistical Information. Much of the information we collect is in 
            the form of aggregated statistics, such as the traffic that visits 
            various pages within our sites, and the habits and preferences of 
            our audience. Such aggregated information does not include any information 
            that would identify you personally. We may use such aggregated information 
            and disclose it to third parties as we see fit. </font></p>

            visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce 
            our Visitor Agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety 
            of visitors to our sites, the public, or WTOV-TV. As our business 
            grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that 
            WTOV-TV, the bulk of our assets, or one or more of our sites is acquired
