# WTA PRIVACY POLICY | WTA Tennis

**WTA Privacy Policy: Your Privacy Rights**

The WTA knows that your privacy is important to you, and we want you to know that it is important to us too. We created this Policy to explain the types of information we collect through our websites (including the mobile optimized versions) and mobile applications on which it is posted (each, a “Site”) and the various social networking platforms that we use (together with the Sites, the “WTA Platforms”), how we will use, disclose, and protect this information once it is collected, and how you can opt out of some of our uses and disclosures of your information.

 **Here are a few general principles to keep in mind as you read through this Policy:**

The Site is owned and operated by WTA Tour, Inc. and its corporate affiliates (referred to collectively in this policy as “we,” “us,” “our” and other similar pronouns).

We may share your Personal Information with third parties for third party marketing and other purposes. You can elect for us not to do so by emailing us at [Legal@wtatennis.com](mailto:Legal@wtatennis.com).

As our business evolves, this Policy may change, so check back to this page periodically to make sure you understand how your personal information will be treated.

This Policy _does not_ apply to information that you may provide to us, or that we may obtain, other than through our Site, such as over the phone, by mail, or in person, except that your rights to opt out of our use and sharing of your personal information with third parties for their own marketing and other purposes applies also to the personal information that we collect offline.

If you are located outside of the United States, you should know that the information you provide to us is being transmitted to us and processed in the United States and will be protected subject to this privacy policy and United States laws, which may not be as protective as the laws in your country. Also, this Site may place cookies and local shared objects on your computer or device, which are further described below. By using the Site, you agree to the placement of cookies and local shared objects on your computer or device

Advertisements displayed to you on the Site and elsewhere may be customized to your interests and preferences based on your personally identifiable information and Site usage Information collected through our Site unless you opt out by following the instructions that can be found here. (You must opt-out using each of your Web browsing applications and devices separately.) However, if you opt-out we may still suggest offerings to you on our Site based on your history at our Site.

By using our Site, you consent to our use of tracking technologies as described below.

 **Opt In and Opt Out**

You may have the right to opt in to or opt out of certain of our uses and disclosures of your Personal Information. For example, when you are asked to provide Personal Information on this Site, you may have the opportunity to elect to, or not to, receive messages from us by e-mail or text message. You may tell us that you do not want to receive our promotional messages, or that you do not want us to share your Personal Information with third parties for their marketing and other purposes by sending us your name, address, e-mail and phone number to: [Legal@wtatennis.com](mailto:Legal@wtatennis.com). Please indicate whether you are asking us to stop sharing your information with third parties, or if you are writing to request that you no longer receive a particular media notification from us. You can also opt-out of our promotional emails by clicking on the opt-out link within the e-mail you receive. Please understand that it may take us a few days to process any opt-out request and that even if you opt out of receiving promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions, and communications with us. Also, to stop receiving promotional messages from third parties who already have your contact information, please contact them directly.

 **What information is collected on this Site?**

 **User-Provided Information**

“Personal Information” is information that can be used to identify you as an individual or allow someone to contact you, as well as information attributed with such information. We collect Personal Information such as your name; postal addresses; e-mail addresses; telephone numbers; fax numbers; wireless device addresses (including text message addresses); photograph; gender; location; credit card and other payment information; purchase, site browsing, and transaction history; interests, hobbies, and demographic information. For example, we collect Personal Information when you conduct a transaction on our Site; create an account on our Site; sign up for our newsletters; make online purchases; enter sweepstakes and contests; complete surveys; contribute to a social forum on the Site; or submit a comment or question to us using a “contact us” or similar feature on the Site.

 **Site Usage Information**

 **As is the case with many websites, our servers automatically collect your IP address when you visit our Site, and we may associate that with your domain name or that of your Internet access provider. We may also capture certain “clickstream data” pertaining to your Site usage. Clickstream data includes, for example, information about your computer or device, Web browser, and operating system and their settings, the referring page that linked you to the Site, the pages, content, or ads you see or click on during your visit and when and for how long you do so, items you download, the next website you visit when you leave the Site, and any search terms you have entered on the Site or a referral site.**

 **Among other things, this information enables us to generate analytics reports on the usage of our Site. To opt-out of your Site usage being included in our Google analytics reports, you may follow these instructions.**

In addition, we may deploy various tracking technologies on the Site to collect additional information about your Site visits. For example:

Cookies are small data files stored on your computer or device at the request of a website. A cookie assigns a unique numerical identifier to your Web browser, and may enable us to recognize you as the same user who was at our Site in the past and relate your use of the Site to other information about you, such as your Site usage information and Personal Information. Cookies may also be used to enhance your experience on the Site (for example, by storing your username so you can log in easily, keeping you logged into the Site after you have provided your password, and storing the contents of your shopping cart as you browse) or to collect general usage and aggregated statistical information and detect and prevent fraud. Most browsers can be set to detect cookies and give you an opportunity to reject them, but refusing cookies may, in some cases, inhibit or preclude your use of the Site or its features. To learn more about the use of cookies, including how to manage or delete them, click here.

Local shared objects, such as “Flash cookies,” may be stored on your computer or device using a media player or other software installed on your computer or device. Local shared objects operate a lot like cookies, but cannot be managed in the same way. Depending on how local shared objects are enabled on your computer or device, you may be able to manage them using software settings. For information on managing Flash cookies, for example, click here.

HTML5 (the language some Web sites are coded in) may be used to store information on your computer or device about your Site usage activities. This information can be retrieved by us to determine how our Site is being used by our visitors, how it can be improved, and to customize it for our users.

Cache cookies, such as eTags, may be used to identify your computer or device as the same computer or device that visited our Site or another website in the past.

Browser history sniffing may be used to enable us to detect whether you have visited a webpage of ours or of someone else’s in the past by determining whether its URL is located in the list of URLs stored in your Web browser’s history file.

Browser fingerprinting can enable us to recognize your computer or device as the same one that has been used to visit our Site in the past based on various detectable information from your computer or device that, together, can be used as a “fingerprint” of your computer or device.

A pixel tag (also known as a “clear GIF” or “web beacon”) is a tiny image – typically just one-pixel – that can be placed on a Web page or in our electronic communications to you in order to help us measure the effectiveness of our content by, for example, counting the number of individuals who visit us online or verifying whether you’ve opened one of our emails or seen one of our Web pages.

These tracking technologies may be deployed by us and/or by our service providers or partners on our behalf. These technologies enable us to assign a unique number to you and relate your Site Usage Information to other information about you, including your Personal Information. These technologies also enable us to recognize you when you access our Site using different Web browsers and different computers or devices.

 **How is your information used?**

We or our service providers may use the information we collect from and about you to perform the following business functions:

\- enabling users to use our Site and its features

\- processing and fulfilling your transactions

\- administering the Site and your account with us

\- responding to your requests, questions, and concerns

\- market research

\- developing new features and offerings on the Site

\- sending you marketing and other communications, including information about products, services, and events, of ours and of others, that we think might interest you. You may opt out of receiving such notices from us by following the instructions in the Opt In and Opt Out section above 

\- protecting our rights and property

\- recovering debt and preventing fraud

\- customizing our Site to your interests and history with us

\- tailoring ads displayed to you on our Site and elsewhere to your interests and history with us and other purposes disclosed when personal information is submitted to us

To perform the above functions, we may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including both Personal Information and Site Usage Information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources (including third parties) such as demographic information and updated contact information. We or our service providers may also use your information to assess the level of interest in, and use of, the Site, our e-mails, and our other messaging campaigns both on an individual basis and in the aggregate.

 **Social Networking**

We maintain a presence on several social networking and blogging platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, and we also incorporate some third-party social networking features onto our Site. Through these platforms and features, we receive some Personal Information and some Site Usage Information about you, and this Privacy Policy applies to that information as well. In addition, third-party social networking platforms and blogging platforms have their own privacy policies that explain how the third parties that provide them will use and protect your information. In accordance with those policies (and your privacy settings within your social networking accounts), information about your activities on our Site (such as “Mary Jane “likes” the WTA” or “John Smith read our article about the WTA Finals” may be published to your social network.

 **Do we share Personal Information and Site Usage Information with others?**

Yes. We may share the information we collect on the WTA Platforms with others for a variety of reasons. In addition to the kinds of information sharing you might expect, such as sharing with third parties who need your information in order to provide services to us and sharing what you voluntarily post to public areas on the WTA Platforms with other WTA Platform users, we may share your information:

\- with our affiliates and other third parties for their marketing and other purposes, unless you tell us not to by following the instructions in the Opt In and Opt Out section above;

\- with our co-sponsor(s) if we obtain your information in connection with a contest, sweepstakes, offering, or other promotional activity that is jointly offered by us and any third parties, unless you instruct us not to by following the instructions in the Opt In and Opt Out section above;

\- when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or property, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or respond to a government, judicial or other legal request, or to comply with the law;

\- in connection with a corporate change or dissolution, including for example a merger, acquisition, reorganization, consolidation, bankruptcy, liquidation, sale of assets, or wind down of business.

In addition, we may share non-personally identifiable Site Usage Information (including aggregate data) with others, for their own use, in a form that does not include your name or contact information.

 **Third-Party Ad Servers and Networks**

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Site. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites, the region of the country or world where your IP address indicates you are located, and other information about you in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These advertisements may appear on this Site and on other websites. These companies may employ cookies, clear GIFs, and other tracking technologies to cause relevant ads to be displayed to you. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such advertisers, ad servers or ad networks. You should consult the respective privacy policies of any advertisers on our website to see your options for opting out of their use of such devices. We encourage you to read these businesses’ privacy policies to learn about how they treat your information. In addition, some of the ad servers and ad networks may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. If you opt-out of receiving targeted ads on our website from ad servers and ad networks, you will continue to receive advertising and promotional messages after you opt-out, but they will not be customized or personalized to you based on your use of our website and/or third party websites. For more information about third-party advertisers and how to prevent them from using your information, visit the NAI’s consumer Web site at [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) or Aboutads.info at [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

 **Do Not Track Disclosures**

Some Web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” (DNT) signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how Web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. We currently do not change our tracking practices (which are explained in more detail under “Site Usage Information” above) in response to DNT settings in your web browser.

Our third-party partners, such as Google Analytics, Quantcast, Mixpanel, and third-party ad networks, collect information about your online activities over time and across our Site and other online properties. These third parties may not change their tracking practices in response to DNT settings in your Web browser and we do not obligate these parties to honor DNT settings. We utilize Google Analytics for our Web analytics and you can opt out of your Site usage data being included in our Google Analytics reports by visiting [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

 **Wireless Addresses**

If the e-mail address you provide to us is a wireless e-mail address, you agree to receive messages from us at such address unless and until you tell us not to send messages to that address, by following the instructions in the Opt In and Opt Out section above. You may change your e-mail preferences at any time, but your wireless carrier’s standard rates will apply as long as you are receiving messages at a wireless e-mail address. If you give us a wireless e-mail address, you represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the device on which messages will be received and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges.

 **Your Access Rights**

You may review, update or modify certain of the Personal Information that is stored in your user account on the Site (if you have one) by logging in to the “My Account” or similar area of the Site. We may ask you to verify your identity and to provide other details before we are able to provide you with any information, correct any inaccuracies, or delete any information. Your right to delete your information is subject to our records retention policies.

 **Security**

While we endeavor to protect the security and integrity of sensitive Personal Information collected via this Site, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that any information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.

If you correspond with us by e-mail or using Web forms like a “contact us” feature on our Site, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view the information you send in transit by such means. We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.

If you create an account on our Site, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, and you shall be responsible for any activity that occurs using your account credentials, whether or not you authorized such activity. Please notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security.

If at any time during or after our relationship we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our care may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we will endeavor to notify you as promptly as possible under the circumstances. If we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail to the most recent e-mail address you have provided us in your account profile. Please keep your e-mail address in your account up to date. You can change that e-mail address anytime in your account profile. If you receive a notice from us, you can print it to retain a copy of it. To receive these notices, you must check your e-mail account using your computer or mobile device and email application software. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification. If you prefer for us to use the U.S. Postal Service to notify you in this situation, please e-mail us at [Legal@wtatennis.com](mailto:Legal@wtatennis.com).

 **“Linked-To” Web Sites**

The Site may contain links, banners, widgets, or advertisements that lead to other websites. We are not responsible for these other sites, and so their posted privacy policies (not this Policy) will govern the collection and use of your information on them. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each website visited after leaving the Site to learn about how your information is treated by others.

 **Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We may change this Policy from time to time. When we do, we will let you know by posting the changed Policy on this page with a new “Effective Date.” In some cases (for example, if we significantly expand our use or sharing of your Personal Information), we may also tell you about changes by additional means, such as by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address we have on file for you. In some cases, we may request your consent to the changes.
