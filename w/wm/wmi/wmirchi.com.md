# Privacy Policy » Wmirchi.Com Best Social Networking site in India

**Wmirchi.Com Privacy Policy    
**  
Wmirchi.Com is an online social networking community that connects people through their personal profiles, and allows them to meet others, find jobs, buy and sell goods, and perform other transactions. Members create their profiles, which other members of this site and other internet users that are not members can see while they browse the site. 

  
Protecting your privacy is very important to our website. We will not sell, lease, or exchange your personal data to third parties without first obtaining your express consent unless we are compelled to do so by law enforcement or other legal agencies. 

  
This privacy policy describes how we collect and use your data. If you have any questions or comments regarding our privacy policy or its enforcement, please feel free to contact us at support@Wmirchi.Com 

  
Wmirchi.Com collects information our users submit to us such as their name and e-mail address to allow us to identify users and notify them of changes or updates to our service. We also collect personal information submitted by our users in filling out their profile on the service such as gender, location, age, etc. We collect this personal information when our users: sign up as a member; make changes to their member profile information; and send e-mail messages. Members may choose to provide additional information beyond their basic profile for their other profile sections. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is optional, but enables our users to identify and effectively communicate with other members. 

  
Like many other Web sites, Wmirchi.Com uses a standard technology called "cookies." Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive - not on our site. They can help make the Internet experience quicker and more convenient. Cookies allow our users to login without entering their ID and password each time they use Wmirchi.Com. Members who disable cookies will not be able to use Wmirchi.Com.   
Email addresses and full name are displayed only when we send email notifications to a user related to their use of the service or when members invites their friends to join the site by email. Users on Wmirchi.Com communicate with each other through the Wmirchi.Com Messaging service without the need to disclose their email addresses. 

  
If you use our Invite feature to invite a friend to our service, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join the site as well as two reminder messages. Wmirchi.Com does not sell these email addresses or use them to transmit any communication other than the invitation and reminders to join your personal Network. Wmirchi.Com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this invitation and reminders, and for tracking the success of our Invite functionality. 

  
The Wmirchi.Com site may contain links to other Web sites. Please be aware that Wmirchi.Com is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites our users choose to visit. If our users provide any information directly to parties other than Wmirchi.Com, different rules may apply to the use or disclosure of the personal information disclosed. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing your personal information to third parties. Read ach sites privacy policy and terms of service as they may be different that the ones on Wmirchi.Com. 

  
Please be aware that whenever members voluntarily disclose personal information online - e.g., message boards, file uploads, events, and classifieds - that information becomes public and can be collected and used by others. By posting personal information online in public forums, members may receive unsolicited messages from other parties
