### Information Collected and Stored Automatically

We do not collect personal information when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information  to us. Every time you visit the Metro site and view pages, we collect the following usage information:

  * the Internet domain, for example, "hostcompany.com" (if you use a private Internet access account) or "theschool.edu" (if you connect from a university's domain) and the IP address (a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our website
  * the type of browser and operating system used to access our site
  * the date and time of your visit
  * the pages you visit
  * if you followed a link to the Metro site, the address of the page from which you came



The information collected allows us to see trends in usage: the most commonly viewed pages, what sites link to the Metro site, and information on the browsers used to view the site.

### Cookies

     

Cookies are small files that can  be placed on your computer by Web servers when you visit a site. These  files may contain information such as ID's and passwords, personal information  or preferences. During your visit, the server can access these files to help  personalize pages or allow you to effect e-commerce more easily.

 

Metro does not set cookies from any page in the wmata.com domain that store personally identifiable information with the exception of the Trip Planner. The [Trip Planner](https://web.archive.org/schedules/trip-planner/index.cfm) stores your input fields and locations as cookies, so if you plan additional trips during your visit to our website, the input fields will already be  filled in for your convenience. Our e-commerce and vendor registration sites set cookies with login information, but only for the convenience of customers who  use these areas repeatedly. If you are concerned about privacy, you may set up  your browser not to accept cookies or you can delete them from your hard drive  once you leave that section of the website.

### Personal Information Collected

There are places on the website where we ask you to provide us with personal information. We collect this information in order to provide you with the specified goods or services you requested. The information collected is owned by Metro and will not be sold or given to any entity outside of Metro except contractors hired by Metro to provide Metro-approved services. These contractors are bound by this policy and are prohibited from using the information except to fulfill the services for which Metro has contracted.

Metro may use the personal information to provide you with Metro-related information, for example, email about upcoming events and promotions. You have the right to opt out of any service or information you receive via a single Web or email command. (Instructions for doing this are included in all Metro email communications.)

Personal information is information that can identify an individual, such as:

  * a first and last name
  * an address, such as work or home, including city and state
  * a telephone number
  * a Social Security number
  * a credit card number
  * an email address



We are required to release personal information if it is subpoenaed by a court or grand jury. We may also provide statistics based on the information automatically collected from your visit to federal, state, and city officials.

**Employment Application Information**

If you fill out an application for employment, the information collected will be used by our human resources personnel to determine whether you qualify for the job. The information will also be shared with the manager of the hiring department. This information will not be given to anyone  outside Metro.

### Links to Other Sites

Metro's website links to external sites for services provided by Metro contractors, such as e-commerce. These sites are subject to Metro's privacy policy.

We also provide links to selected sites unconnected to Metro, such as other area transit providers and visitor centers, which we feel would be of benefit to you as transit riders. If you follow these links, you are leaving the Metro  site and are subject to the privacy policies of those sites.

Note that the links we provide to outside sites are offered for your convenience. Metro takes no responsibility for outside sites' content or policies.
