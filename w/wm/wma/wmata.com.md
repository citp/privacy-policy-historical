# Metro privacy and data use policy

This page outlines Metro's privacy policy governing personal data collected on this Web site. Metro also has a broader [corporate privacy policy](https://web.archive.org/about/parp_docs/pi_9_2_0.pdf) protecting the privacy of individuals who are the subjects of records maintained in WMATA [systems of records](https://web.archive.org/about/sorn_documents.cfm). WMATA interprets and applies this privacy policy consistent with the federal Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, and federal practice.

## Summary

Metro respects your privacy. We collect personal data online only if you buy from us online, subscribe to our e-mail subscription service, or apply for a job online. If so, we use this information only for fulfilling your requests. We do not lease, sell or otherwise release your personal information to outside companies for marketing purposes. Metro contractors may collect personal data in order to provide contracted services. These contractors are bound by Metro's privacy policy.

If you do not supply personal information for one of the purposes listed above, we make no attempt to identify you individually. Rather, we track only aggregate usage data to help us improve site content and organization. The policy details section below specifies what information we collect and how we use it.

**Information collected and stored automatically for each visit to the Web site**

We do not collect personal information when you visit our Web site unless you choose to provide that information to us. Every time you visit the Metro site and view pages, we collect the following usage information:

  * The Internet domain, for example, "hostcompany.com" (if you use a private Internet access account) or "theschool.edu" (if you connect from a university's domain) and the IP address (a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our Web site;  

  * The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;  

  * The date and time or your visit;  

  * The pages you visit;  

  * If you followed a link to the Metro Web site, the address of the page from which you came. 



The information collected allows us to see trends in usage—the most commonly viewed pages, what sites link to the Metro site, and information on the browsers used to view the site. 

**Cookies**

Cookies are small files which can be placed on your computer by Web servers when you visit certain sites. These files may contain information such as ID's and passwords, personal information, or preferences. During your visit, the server can access these files to help personalize pages or allow you to effect e-commerce more easily. 

Metro does not set cookies from any page in the wmata.com domain. Our e-commerce and vendor registration sites set cookies with login information only for the convenience of customers who use these areas repeatedly. If you are concerned about privacy, you may set up your browser not to accept cookies, or you can delete them from your hard drive once you leave the section.

**Personal information collected**

There are places on the Web site where we ask you to provide us personal information. We collect this information in order to provide you with the specified goods or services you requested. The information collected is owned by Metro and will not be sold or given to any entity outside of Metro except contractors hired by Metro to provide Metro-approved services. These contractors are bound by this policy and are prohibited from using the information except to fulfill the services for which Metro has contracted. 

Metro may use the personal information to provide you with Metro-related information; for example, e-mails about upcoming events and promotions. You have the right to opt out of any service or information you receive via a single Web or e-mail command. (Instructions for doing this are included on all Metro e-mail services.)

**Employment application information**

If you fill out an application for employment, the information collected will be used by our human resources personnel to determine whether you qualify for the job. The information will also be shared by the manager of the hiring department. This information will not be given to anyone outside Metro.

**Links to other sites**

Metro's Web site links to external sites for services provided by Metro contractors, such as e-commerce. These sites are subject to Metro's privacy policy. 

We also provide links to selected sites unconnected to Metro, such as other area transit providers, and visitor centers, which we feel would be of benefit to you as transit riders. If you follow these links, you are leaving the Metro Web site and are subject to the privacy policies of those sites. 

_Note that the links we provide to outside sites are offered for your convenience. Metro takes no responsibility for outside sites' content or policies._

**Copyright**

  * a first and last name
  * an address, such as work or home, including city and state
  * a telephone number
  * a Social Security number
  * a credit card number
  * an e-mail address



_Please note: We are required to release personal information if it is subpoenaed by a court or grand jury. We may also provide statistics based on theinformation automatically collected from your visit to federal, state and city officials._
