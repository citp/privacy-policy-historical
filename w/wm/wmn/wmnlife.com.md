We do this to understand the effectiveness of our Site. We never sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We may use location information, either information you provided by you or information automatically collected, in order to provide you with location-based content, interest-based content services and advertising.

We do not share information that personally identifies you (personally identifiable information is information like name or email address) with these partners.  
When you use third-party apps, websites or other products integrated with our Services, they may collect information about your activities subject to their own terms and privacy policies.  
We allow other companies that show advertisements on our Site to collect information from your browsers or devices. Other companies' use of cookies and other data collection technologies are subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Like many companies, we may allow cookie matching with select partners. But, these parties are not authorized to access ours cookies.  
We may disclose Personal Information when legally required to do so, to cooperate with law enforcement investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site, to limit our legal liability and protect our rights or to protect the rights, property or safety of users of this Site, the Service or the public.. We may also disclose your Personal Information to outside individuals and/or companies that help us bring you the products and services we offer and to create, operate, and maintain our Site. For example, we may work with third parties to:

  * to communicate with you by email, postal mail, telephone, text message or other means about our company, our products, or other company’s
  * services, products or information that we believe may be of interest to you
  * manage a database of customer information
  * assist us with direct marketing, distributing e-mails and data collection
  * provide data storage and analysis
  * provide fraud prevention

We require that these outside companies agree to keep all information shared with them confidential and to use the information only to perform their obligations to us.  
In addition, if we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred.  
We may share non-Personal Information, such as aggregate user statistics, demographic information and Usage Information with third parties. We may combine your Usage Information with those of other users of the Service in order to share trend information with third parties, always in aggregated and anonymized form. For example, we may use your Usage Information as part of an aggregated number to tell a prospective sponsor how many people visit sports our Site each month.  
We may share Personal Data with our affiliates, subsidiaries, vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this Policy. For example, we may hire companies to assist with protecting and securing our systems or services. Any vendor or agent that we retain must comply with our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. Those companies may be located outside of the European Economic Area. 

**HOW WE STORE AND PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION**  
Transmitting information over the internet is generally not completely secure. We have procedures and security in place to keep personal data secure once it is in our systems.  
We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we make reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.  
We will keep your personal information for as long as we have a relationship with you. Once our relationship with you has come to an end, we will retain your personal information for a period of time that enables us to:

  * Maintain business records for analysis, understanding market trends and/or audit purposes and to improve the Site
  * Comply with record retention requirements under applicable laws or other relevant legal or regulatory requirements
  * Defend, establish, exercise or bring any existing or potential legal claims
  * Carry out fraud detection and prevention
  * Deal with any complaints regarding the Site.



We will delete your personal information when it is no longer required for these purposes. If there is any information that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete from our systems, we will put in place appropriate measures to prevent any further processing or use of the data.  
We store personal data in digital format on secure cloud servers and systems in the U.S. and our service providers may be located there and in other countries. By providing us personal information, you agree that your personal information may be transferred to and stored in these countries. These countries may have different and/or less stringent privacy/data protection and data security rules than those of your own country. As a result, your personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those countries according to laws in those countries. Subject to the applicable laws in such other countries, we will provide the necessary safeguards to maintain protections of your personal information, e.g. by obtaining from the data recipients contractual commitments based on the EU model clauses.  
Access to personal data is highly restricted internally for approved business purposes only. We keep your personal data only for as long as we need to. This depends on why it was collected, or if we have a continuing legal basis to do so (such as to fulfill a contract between us, perform a service you requested or for our legitimate interests). Rest assured, if we no longer have a reason or legal requirement to process your personal data, we will delete it or store it in a way so that it no longer identifies you.

 **HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT OF WEB TRACKING**  
There are several ways to opt out of web tracking:  
Most browsers allow you to block third-party cookies or prevent cross-domain tracking. This will limit the cookies that can be set by third-party scripts. This will not completely eliminate tracking by some third-party services though as they may use first-party cookies. Most browsers also allow you ask not to be tracked (it sends the “Do Not Track” request header). If you have enabled this feature, we will not track the pages you visit in a way that enables us to connect them to your personal information. Your page views may still be collected anonymously though. Many of the third-party services we use for collecting anonymous data also respect the Do Not Track setting.  
You can opt out of interest-based advertising on these two pages: NAI consumer opt-out page - http://optout.networkadvertising.org/ and DAA opt-out page - http://optout.aboutads.info/. This will not remove ads, but will for example remove the possibility for us to display ads to people that have visited our Site. Note that these services in themselves requires cookies. You can also opt out from the individual services we use:
