# WFUBMC: Privacy Statement

**Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center Privacy Statement**

**Overview**   
Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center (WFUBMC) is recognized for our commitment to safeguarding consumer privacy on our web sites. We operate under the following set of strict privacy principles: 

The only information WFUBMC obtains about individual visitors to its web sites is that supplied voluntarily by visitors. 

In cases when WFUBMC may need personal information to provide visitors with customized content or to inform them about new features or services, visitors are explicitly asked for that information. 

Personally identifiable information provided by visitors (name, e-mail or home address, etc.) will not be disclosed to anyone unless visitors indicate that WFUBMC may do so. 

Personally identifiable information will not be shared at any time without the visitor's permission. WFUBMC employs strict security measures to safeguard online transactions; personal information is stored in a secured database and always sent via an encrypted Internet channel. 

The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices: 

**IP Addresses**   
An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. All computer identification on the Internet is conducted with IP addresses, which allow computers and servers to recognize and communicate with each other. WFUBMC collects IP addresses in order to conduct system administration and to conduct site analysis. If a visitor requests pages from WFUBMC, the WFUBMC servers enter the visitor's IP address into a log. To maintain visitor anonymity, WFUBMC does not associate IP addresses with records containing personal information. However, WFUBMC will use IP addresses to identify any visitors who refuse to comply with WFUBMC's in-house rules or access agreement, and to identify visitors who threaten our service, site, customers or others. 

**Cookies**   
Our site places a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to an individual's hard disk for record keeping purposes.
