**PRIVACY STATEMENT FOR wfmz.com**  
as required by the CHILDREN'S ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT  
WFMZ Online - Maranatha Broadcasting Company, Inc.  
---  
   
 **Maranatha Broadcasting Company, Inc.**  
has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this site.  
  
This is how we will handle information we learn about you from your visit to our website. The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting our site.

 **If you visit our site to browse or read information such as news, weather, sports scores and the like:** We collect and store only the following information about you: the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account, or princeton.edu if you are connecting from Princeton University's domain); the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site. None of the above information can personally identify you or anyone in your household. We use the information we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site, and to help us make our site more useful to visitors. 

**If you identify yourself by sending an E-mail:** You also may decide to send us personally-identifying information, for example, in an electronic mail message containing a comment or complaint. We use personally-identifying information from our online users in the event a response is requested. It may also be used to help rectify a problem which may occur with a service to which you have subscribed. 

**If you identify yourself by completing a "comment" form:** We require that you use your email address when completing our online comments form. This is to help prevent abuse or malicious use of this valuable line of communication. We may also use your email address if you have requested a reply to a question. Your email address, comments, and other information from the form is only stored in an archive fashion, and is not made part of any other mailing list or database. Some of the information that you may be asked to supply (cable system, home town, etc.) is typically used in an aggregate form for statistical or analytical purposes.

 **If you complete an online contest entry form:** We may run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. Your name, postal address, email address and the like on a contest entry form is used solely for our direct contact with you. 

**If you register for any of our online services:** This site offers several services for which registration is required. These include (but are not limited to) Stormcenter Update school closing information, and our Headline Email News Service. The information gathered is necessary for the functionality of these services. 

**Cookies** A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. WFMZ uses a cookie when you register for Stormcenter Update information, when you participate in one of our online surveys, and at other times. The Stormcenter Update cookie allows you to get your information faster, without having to enter your login and password each time you check for updates.
