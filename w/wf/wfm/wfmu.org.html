WFMU is not one of those evil multi-national conglomerates that is trying to collect as much data about you as possible so we can sell you shoes, cosmetics, and/or toilet paper. The truth is, we just don't have the energy or the algorithms to determine the perfect mascara for your eyelash type. <br>
<br>
But we do care about your privacy and in order to prove to you just how much we care about your privacy, we came up with a policy. That's love, people. Policy = love.<br>
<br>
Anything in bold below represents an attempt by an actual human to translate the legalese.
