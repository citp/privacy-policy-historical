Privacy Policy for whyy.org Visitors

Thank you for visiting whyy.org. We know you don't want the information you provide us shared indiscriminately. Here we explain how whyy.org collects information, what we do with it, and what controls you have. We're committed to ensuring the privacy of your personally identifiable information, and to protecting your ability to make financial transactions and transmit your personal data with full confidence.

Please read our privacy policy carefully, and if you have any questions or concerns, please contact us. Also, note that whyy.org links to numerous other sites, such as PBS and NPR. Please consult those sites to learn more about their policies.

**Gathering and Use of Information**  
Neither WHYY, nor our fulfillment agent who supports "WHYY Shop" pages, will willfully disclose any personally identifiable information about our online users to any third party without first receiving the user's permission, unless required by law. The whyy.org Web site and our "WHYY Shop" pages only collect personally identifiable information from our visitors on a voluntary basis (such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and/or other identifying information). You should recognize that under certain circumstances, if you choose not to voluntarily submit requested information, you may not be able to engage in certain activities -- e.g., WHYY schedule personalization, accessing WHYY membership information, entering online contests, purchasing videos or books -- for which personally identifiable information is needed.

  


**Secure Credit Card Transactions**  
The whyy.org Web site and our "Shop WHYY" pages offer you the convenience of making membership contributions and product purchases via credit card. WHYY and our fulfillment agent, who supports "Shop WHYY" pages, utilize state-of-the-art measures to ensure credit card account information security and to secure any information from your computer to our server. Our Web financial transaction forms are stored and served from secure servers. This means that each page you view and any information you submit is encrypted on its way between computers (yours and ours, or yours and our fulfillment agent's). Even in the highly unlikely event that your transmission is intercepted, it should not be usable. Your peace of mind and the safeguarding of your credit card information are top priorities for us. All online credit card transactions are done through a secure server using 128-bit SSL; you know you're on a secure page when the Web address starts with "https" (the "s" is for "secure"). Your credit card information is used only for your intended purpose -- that is, for the purchase or contribution you wish to make.

**E-mail Addresses**  
WHYY and our fulfillment agent, who supports "Shop WHYY" pages, maintain customer databases with e-mail addresses of viewers, listeners and members, Web visitors who have provided them to WHYY by registering at our site, audience members who e-mail questions about membership or programs, donors who submit online membership contributions (that is, make an online pledge), or online buyers who make a purchase. We will use these addresses to send information about WHYY programs, Web sites, services, membership or to correspond about a purchase or product offers.

WHYY does not sell, exchange, or lend e-mail addresses to outside companies, organizations, or individuals except where required by law. WHYY will always provide a clear and convenient method of unsubscribing to our e-mailings.  Follow the unsubscribe directions included in every e-mail message we send. We will update our records as soon as possible. If you have already unsubscribed from WHYY e-mails, rest assured that we will continue to honor your request.

Our fulfillment agent's e-mail database will never be released by them except in response to a lawful court order or when instructed by WHYY. Their sole use of your e-mail address and other information is to communicate with you about your purchase or to answer questions you may ask, unless you have approved another use. If you have approved another use, each e-mail will include unsubscribe instructions.

**WHYY and Your Postal Address**  
Like many nonprofits, we occasionally exchange some of our donors' names and postal addresses with carefully selected like-minded nonprofit organizations using a process that does not permit the other organizations to review or retain a copy of the membership list. When you make an online contribution, your name and postal address will be included as eligible for an exchange. Exchange of the list allows WHYY to expand its membership base by obtaining the names and addresses of other likely donors, and provides a valuable source of additional funding.

Please note that on every online contribution form, we give you the opportunity to opt out of having your name and address shared. If at any time you would like to check or update our record of your information, please let us know by using the whyy.org [Contact Us](http://www.whyy.org/about/contact.html) page. If you already have opted out of having your name and address exchanged, rest assured that we will continue to honor your request, except where required by law.

By using this site, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy for whyy.org. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please do not use this site. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of whyy.org following the posting of any changes to these terms shall mean that you have accepted those changes. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us.
