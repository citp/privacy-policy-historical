# Privacy Policy

Effective Since and Last Edited on: Feb. 11, 2015

This statement discloses the privacy practices for the WholeMom.com website. By visiting WholeMom.com, you are accepting the practices described herein. Because Whole Mom wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and notify you of the following:

 **Information We Collect**

The information we collect helps us ensure that our services are best designed to meet your needs. We receive and store any information that you enter on any registration page. Typically these will be registration forms for sweepstakes, surveys or other promotions. If you are giving us information in order to participate in a survey, sweepstakes or other promotion, your participation is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. If some information is required and some is optional, we will identify the required information. We collect both contact and other information.

A. Contact Information

Contact information consists of the information that we can use to contact you if, for example, you win one of the contests or promotions sponsored by Whole Mom and/or its affiliates and partners. This consists of your name, your e-mail address, IP address and possibly your mailing address, telephone and facsimile number. Visitors who supply Whole Mom with their postal address may receive periodic postal mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events. They may also receive mailings from other reputable companies.

B. Other Information

Profile data also is collected at our site. Depending on the specific Whole Mom products for which a user (“User”) registers, various information will be requested. We use this data to tailor the visitor’s experience through our interest-focused e-mails. By obtaining this information, we can provide our Users with specific content that we think they might be interested in, according to their preferences and interests. The User may include only the information he or she feels comfortable including. However, the omission of certain information may limit the value of the experience for the User. As a result, the more information we have about a User, the more valuable the WholeMom.com experience will be for that User. In addition, Whole Mom provides services for direct marketing applications including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation.

 **How User Information is Used**

Information that you provide

Whole Mom does not send unsolicited or “spam” e-mail. We use User information in a number of ways, including:

  1. to send personalized, targeted information to the User in the form of e-mail messages and/or direct mail;
  2. to send targeted advertising that allows us to provide our service at no or little cost to the Users;
  3. to send promotions and coupons based on their interests;
  4. to contact Users for feedback and surveys;
  5. to monitor and improve its internal operations, as well as to ensure that it properly performs the services requested and bills properly where appropriate; and
  6. to send Users other information about Whole Mom and/or its products.



Note: You will always be given the opportunity to immediately and permanently unsubscribe from these mailings.

When you register with WholeMom.com, you may receive offers from us or our marketing partners. Our marketing partners may use this information to make offers to you in your areas of interest or other offers. Our marketing partners wishing to contact you either give their e-mail message to us and we deliver it to you, or we provide your contact information to them so they can deliver messages directly to you. It is solely at your discretion if you choose to provide additional personally identifiable information to a marketer by making a purchase, requesting additional information, or communicating directly with the company or organization after using its website. We may also use outside companies to execute the marketing campaigns on our behalf or on behalf of some of our marketing partners. We will share your e-mail, name & other information that you give us that is necessary for these third parties to provide these services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purposes of providing these services.

 **Cobranded and Other Affiliated Sites  **

Certain information or services offered or provided on or through the Site from time to time may be provided on or through other sites operated by or in conjunction with third party providers (“Partners”). These sites may have the same “look and feel” of the Site, and are often cobranded, such that a Partner’s logo or name may appear on the site, or the Partner’s name may appear in the URL. Aggregate or personally identifiable information collected about you on these sites may be shared by Whole Mom with that Partner. A Partner will not rent, sell, or disclose any of your personally identifiable information to third parties unless you consent to its doing so, for example, by opting-in while on a particular site to receive information or offers from a Partner’s affiliates, partners, or other third parties.

 **Third Party Links and Member Websites  **

You acknowledge that we do not monitor, control or endorse the information collection or privacy practices of any third parties, any co-branded or other affiliated sites which may or may not be owned or operated by or in conjunction with Whole Mom, or any credit card order processors, product shippers or other third parties who provide services throughout the Site. Accordingly, Whole Mom assumes no liability or responsibility for the information collection and privacy practices of any third party. In addition, Whole Mom is not responsible for the content of any third party websites, including a third party’s use of any cookies or any other information (such as IP address, browser type or operating system) collected when you “click-through” links to their sites or view advertisements served by them. Even though certain information collected by such third parties might not identify you personally, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with their privacy practices, and to contact such third parties if you have any questions about their respective privacy policies. In addition, the Site may provide links to other Internet websites or resources (“Linked Sites”). Whole Mom neither controls nor endorses such Linked Sites nor have we reviewed or approved any content that appears on such Linked Sites. You acknowledge and agree that Whole Mom is not responsible for the legality, accuracy or inappropriate nature of any content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from such Linked Sites.
