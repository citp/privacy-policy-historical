**Use of your information by third parties or as required by the relevant TLD registries.**  
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, the international governing body for TLDs (Top Level Domains) requires that registrars must make available the corporate/personal information collected from you when you apply to register a domain name to the public through the publicly accessible database known as the Whois Database. This is a public policy adopted by the domain name industry as a whole.
