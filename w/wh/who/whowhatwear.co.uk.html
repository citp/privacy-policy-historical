                    <p class="p p--story">We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
                    <p class="p p--story">We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

                    <p class="p p--story">To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
                    <p class="p p--story">Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal information are available in our retention policy which you can request from us by contacting us at <a class="link link--story" undefined="" href="mailto:privacy@cliquebrands.com" automate_uuid="326aix95u93">privacy@cliquebrands.com</a></p>

                    <p class="p p--story">In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

                    <p class="p p--story">You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights).

You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting [our data privacy manager whose contact information can be found at the beginning of this Privacy Policy].</p>

                    <p class="p p--story">You have the right to:</p>
                    <ul class="p">
                    <li class="list__item list__item--story"><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal information (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
                    <li class="list__item list__item--story"><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new information you provide to us.</li>
                    <li class="list__item list__item--story"><strong> Request erasure </strong> of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
                    <li class="list__item list__item--story"><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
                    <li class="list__item list__item--story"><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the information's accuracy; (b) where our use of the information is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your information but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
                    <li class="list__item list__item--story"><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
                    <li class="list__item list__item--story"><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
