# Privacy Policy Whois Domain Lookup Database

**WHOIS, Domain names and everything related**

**What is a Domain name and how does it work?**

The internet and several other large and private networks make use of the DNS or the Domain Name System to direct the traffic online. The DNS is also popularly called the 'phonebook of the internet'. The internet makes use of DNS as a name resolution service for public websites across the world. It refers to a decentralized naming system that is fit for computer or services that are connected to the internet or even a private network. Overall, it serves as an important component for the smooth functioning of internet. When a user types the name of a site in a browser, the DNS finds the corresponding IP address for it and any other data required to get the desired network connection. So a Domain Name System is actually a friendly way of naming the web servers or the web pages. It defines addresses to them. They work very similar to an international phone number and give servers an easy to remember and easy to spell address. On the other hand, they also hide the IP addresses that are technical and are not very useful to the viewer as well.

Apart from all that is mentioned above, the domain system is also responsible for assigning domain names and mapping those names to the internet resources by providing **name servers** to every particular domain. The internet maintains two different spaces for names; one is for domain name hierarchy while the second one is for IP address. It is also important to know here that the domain name system provides the translation services to and fro on the internet.
