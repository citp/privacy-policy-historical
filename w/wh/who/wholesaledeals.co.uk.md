**Does WholesaleDeals.co.uk Share the Information It Receives?**

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, we are not in the business of selling it to others. We may share customer information only as described below, under controls that are either subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy:

  * **Agents:** we employ companies to perform some functions on our behalf. Examples include delivering packages (couriers) and processing credit card payments (banks). They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process personal information in accordance with the UK's Data Protection Act. When using services like Nochex and PayPal please refer to their privacy policies.
  * **Protection of WholesaleDeals.co.uk and others:** we release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce or apply our [Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20081006162844id_/http%3A//www.wholesaledeals.co.uk/about/conditions.php "Conditions of Sale and Use of our Services") and other agreements, or to protect the rights, property or safety of WholesaleDeals.co.uk, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. This does not include by any means selling, renting, sharing or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in a way that is contrary to the commitments made in this Privacy Policy.



**Information Security**

  * We work to protect the security of your information by using 128 Bit Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) transmission, which encrypts information you input using the highest industry security standards.
  * We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personally identifiable customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.
  * You can unsubscribe from our Products Alert Newsletter or [request removal of your personal information from our database](https://www.wholesaledeals.co.uk/contact.php) at any time.
