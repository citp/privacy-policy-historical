# Whole Foods Market : Privacy Statement

**General**  
Whole Foods Market thinks your privacy is important. Please read this section of our website to learn more about Whole Foods Market's philosophy and privacy policy. We understand that the protection of privacy is a major concern to many of our customers. For more than 20 years Whole Foods Market has worked hard to gain your trust by selling only the highest quality foods and products, and we want to do everything reasonably possible to keep your trust. To build on our relationship, Whole Foods Market wants you to understand a little bit about how our website interacts with visitors and how we will use any information gathered when you visit our website.

**Types Of Information Gathered**  
Whole Foods Market may gather the following types of information: (1) information given voluntarily while using a feature of this website, for example, during a registration process; (2) information gathered as a result of voluntary participation in a survey or poll, or when communicating with our webmaster or customer service Team Members; and (3) information gathered automatically when visitors visit our website.

**Registration**  
In order for you to receive certain benefits of our website you may first be asked to supply certain information such as your zip code. Whole Foods Market wants to supply you with information that benefits you and the more relevant information we have about you the better we are able to do this.

Whole Foods Market currently has an electronic newsletter and may launch similar products in the future. If you choose to receive our electronic newsletter, you will be asked for certain information so that we can customize your newsletter to suit your needs. Upon registering, you will be asked for your first name, email address, zip code, and other information specified in the enrollment process. This information is used to deliver you a personalized electronic newsletter that we believe will be of interest to you. You may be asked to tell us a little about your interests, what sorts of articles you like to read, the sorts of wellness choices you currently make, and other questions of this nature. The more of this information you choose to share with us, the better we can craft a newsletter specifically for you.

If you choose not to share information with us the newsletter will simply be more generic. For example, if you are primarily interested in articles about the environment, we can't deliver those to you unless you share your interest with us. Similarly if you are a vegetarian and request recipes without disclosing this fact, we can't guarantee that all recipes we send you will be meat-free. Providing us with this type of information is voluntary and you may change supplied information or unsubscribe at any time from any portion or all of Whole Foods Market's online services.
