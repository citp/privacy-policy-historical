# Privacy Policy : Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution

This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

Information Collection and Use  
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution collects information from our users at several different points on our Website.

Cookies  
No personally identifiable information (e-mail address, name, etc.) is collected with the cookies that we set, and accepting cookies while on the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution site will not put the user at risk for marketing to other sites.

Different browsers have different cookie-settings. With Netscape you can ask the browser to allow, warn you, or completely disable cookies. Internet Explorer has an additional feature where you can specify different settings for different security zones. You can choose to allow Websites to create cookies for you in your "trusted sites" (like Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution), to warn you before you create them in your local Intranet zone, and to give you an option to never allow them in a "restricted zone." See the "Help" section of your particular browser for more information on working with cookies.

Web Statistics  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use for reporting and sponsorship purposes. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

Sharing  
We will share aggregated demographic information with our sponsors and donors. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We only share this information so that we can secure funding to continue providing this site free of charge.

Links  
This Website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution does not claim any responsibility for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Website.

Security  
This Website takes every precaution to protect our users' information, and we have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.

Surveys and Feedback section  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via Web surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include demographic information (such as education level), but no information that can identify any individual person will be collected. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

Send This to a Friend  
If a user elects to use our "Send this to a friend" function, we ask them for the friend's name and e-mail address. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the site. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution stores this information temporarily for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail.

Notification of Changes  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this page.
