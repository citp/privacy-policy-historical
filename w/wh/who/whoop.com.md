# WHOOP Privacy Policy

Last updated August 19, 2014

## Introduction

Whoop knows you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. **By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.**

Remember that your use of Whoop’s Services is at all times subject to the Terms of Use [www.whoop.com/privacy](http://www.whoop.com/privacy/), which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Use [www.whoop.com/termsofuse](http://www.whoop.com/termsofuse/).

## Scope of this Policy

This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below. 

We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at [support@whoop.com](mailto:support@whoop.com).

## Changes

We may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time, but we will alert you to changes by delivering a notice through the Services, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.

## Information Collected

### Information You Intentionally Submit to Us

We receive and sometimes store information you knowingly provide to us. For example, in order to use certain parts of our Services, you must submit Personal Information including such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, demographic and location information, and credit card information. In order to provide location-based features of our Services, we may determine your location using a variety of means, including GPS, IP address, or cell tower location. We also collect and store information that you submit to us that is not Personal Information, such as your responses to surveys and any User Content you post via the Services. 

We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you no longer wish to receive email communications from us, please follow the opt-out instructions in the email or contact us at support@whoop.com. 

### Information Collected Automatically

Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. 

“Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us who visits what features of our Services and when. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. 

We may also use data collection tags or directives such as “pixel tags,” Javascript scripts, API calls, or similar means (individually or collectively, “Usage Tracking”) in combination with cookies and the demographic or psychographic data we have collected, and with third-party analysis partners, to analyze usage patterns of users anonymously and to serve advertisements to you that are tailored based on our analysis of what we believe you would respond favorably to in light of the information that we have collected or accessed about you as described above. A “pixel tag” is an electronic image, often a single pixel and often transparent, that is placed on a web page and may be associated with cookies on your hard drive. Usage Tracking allows us to count users who have visited certain web sites and pages within web sites, or used applications or features, to analyze the behavior of users of our web sites and application, in order to improve the web sites and application, and to personalize and determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.

We may also obtain information, including personally identifiable information, from third parties and sources other than the Service, such as our partners or advertisers. We may also, at your direction, receive information from third party services that provide a mechanism to expose information you have provided to such third party through the use of an application program interface (API), such as Facebook Connect or the Twitter API.

When we collect the usage information described above, we only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This aggregated data can tell us, for example, how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services useful to as many users as possible. 

When you use the Services in connection with wearable sensors, we also collect the information monitored by those sensors, such as heart rate, motion, skin connectivity and ambient temperature and we link that information with your Personal Information in order to provide the Services (including determining and reporting on trends, exercise intensities and recovery scores). 

## Sharing of Your Information

We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:

**Information that’s no longer personally identifiable:** We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you are not individually identified, and provide that information to our partners for informational and analytics purposes. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners, who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services. Our advertising partners may use this information to display ads which they believe are more relevant to you. However, we never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual. 

**Our Agents:** We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide our Services to you and to operate and improve our Services. For example, our agents may process data, analyze usage patterns, or perform other types of analysis and evaluation on our behalf. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. 

**Users and Organizations:** Certain user profile information, including your name, location, and any content that you post via the Services may be displayed to other users of the Services or to users of third party social media platforms depending on the configuration of your account. If your use of the Services is on behalf of or managed by a coach, team, organizing body or other entity you are affiliated with (“Managing Entity”), that Managing Entity is responsible for determining which information and content associated with your account is publicly shared and you consent to that Managing Entity allowing that information to be publicly shared, subject to any features of the Services that expressly override that control. In addition, the Managing Entity will have access to all of the user information associated with your account, regardless of any sharing settings, and you consent to that access. Please remember that any content you post via the Services may become publicly available and can be collected, viewed and used by anyone. If you do not want others to see your information or any content you post, do not provide it. Users can enter Stealth mode for short periods of time during which no score or activity information will be displayed on the public Whoop platform.

**Business Transfers:** We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. 

**Protection of Whoop and Others:** We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our Terms of Use [www.whoop.com/termsofuse](http://www.whoop.com/termsofuse/) and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Whoop, our employees, our users, or others.

## Security

If you choose to register an account with us, it will be protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. 

We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. 

## Access to Personal Information

When you log in to your account, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you’ve provided to us: name, address, and demographic information. Users cannot edit physiological data collected.

UNDER CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTIONS 1798.83-1798.84, CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ARE ENTITLED TO ASK US FOR A NOTICE IDENTIFYING THE CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WHICH WE SHARE WITH OUR AFFILIATES AND/OR THIRD PARTIES FOR MARKETING PURPOSES, AND PROVIDING CONTACT INFORMATION FOR SUCH AFFILIATES AND/OR THIRD PARTIES. IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT AND WOULD LIKE A COPY OF THIS NOTICE, PLEASE SUBMIT A WRITTEN REQUEST TO: [SUPPORT@WHOOP.COM](mailto:support@whoop.com).

## Choices

You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.

You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. You may request deletion of your account by emailing [support@whoop.com](mailto:support@whoop.com). Some information may remain in our records after your deletion of such information from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally, and we may also retain and continue to use your non-personally identifiable information.
