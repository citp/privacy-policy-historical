The information we learn from customers helps us fulfill product orders and continually improve your Wholetones experience. You can choose not to provide certain information or allow certain technologies to gather information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of our features.  Here are the types of information we gather. 

  * **Information You Give Us:** We may collect information you provide while using the Services or give us in any other way. You provide most such information when you buy; participate on social media or in a contest, survey, or affiliate program; or communicate with customer service. Examples of this type of information include but aren’t limited to your name, addresses, email, phone number, user name and password, payment information, demographic information, and communication preferences.

  * **Automatic Information:** We may use common technologies such as cookies and web beacons to help track your use of our Services, recognize you when you return to the Services, store items in your shopping cart, or save your preferences. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser or mobile device by websites, mobile apps, and advertisements that you access or use. This data is stored on your browser or mobile device and helps websites and mobile apps to remember things about you to improve your experience with the website. Through these technologies, we may collect information such as browser/operating system; web pages viewed; length of time a page was viewed; sites visited prior to coming to our site and path taken through our site; email, offer, and link actions; and, when using our mobile app, location and unique identifier for your mobile device. Web beacons may also allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party. Consult the Help section of your browser to learn more about how to manage these technologies.
  * **Compiled Information:** Some information we collect is based on your transaction history with us, such as purchase history, affiliate activity, and customer service communication records.

Our automated decision-making capabilities include logic that will send triggered messages based on customer data or behavior. Using this logic helps us provide a better customer experience to you, such as enabling you to receive messages (such as email or a phone call) based on data you have provided (such as during a support session, chat, or social media post) or a behavior in which you've engaged (such as watching a video).

### **Use of Personal Information**

For example, the information we collect and compile may help us communicate with you, create and manage your account, respond to your product orders and requests, process payments, enroll you in contests or offers you request, improve the customer service experience, improve our products and services, develop new products and services, refine the usability of our online services, determine the effectiveness of advertising, customize advertising, make emails more useful and interesting, and provide you with location-based services such as advertising and other personalized content.  We may also share your information as described below. ****

**_Information about you is shared with others_   
Our affiliates may share personal information among themselves. In addition, we may share personal information with other entities, including in the following circumstances:

  * **Service Providers:** We may share your personal information with service providers that perform certain functions or services on our behalf (such as to host websites and mobile applications, manage databases, perform analyses, send communications for us, or provide certain other components of websites, mobile applications, or mobile alerts). We do not authorize service providers to use or disclose the information, except as necessary to perform services on our behalf. In such cases, collection and use of your personal information will be subject to their own privacy notice and practices, but we will treat it in accordance with this Privacy Notice to the extent it comes into our possession for processing.
  * **Analytics:** We may allow third parties to collect information in order to provide us with analytics. For instance, we may use analytics tools provided by Google to help us understand how people use the Services. You can learn more about how Google collects and uses information as a part of its tools at <http://www.google.com/analytics/> .
  * **Affiliate Program:** We have an affiliate program in which third parties may refer customers to us for compensation. When you click a link to our site that is posted by an affiliate, or make a purchase through that affiliate, customer information related to those transactions will be shared with that affiliate. 
  * **Marketing & Promotions:** We may share your personal information with select third parties for their marketing purposes. We describe below how you may choose to instruct us not to share personal information about you with our marketing partners.
  * **Ads & Direct Mail:** We may contract with third party vendors to provide ads to our customers on our behalf via the Internet or to send direct mail to customers whom we think may be interested in our products or services. In order to do so, such vendor may collect anonymous information about your visits to our website using a cookie and may then pool the anonymous information collected from our website with other sources of information, which may include your name and mailing address, for purposes of determining whether you might be interested in receiving direct mail. To opt-out of receiving our direct mail or catalogs, you may email us at support@wholetones.com or call us at 855-400-2278.
  * **Social Media Sites:** Any content you post to a social media site on which we have a presence is shareable as stated in their terms of service and will be subject to their privacy policy (if any).

  * **Protection of Wholetones and Others:** We may disclose your personal information if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity, or violation of our [Terms of Use](https://wholetones.com/terms) or other agreements. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 
  * **Legal Obligations:** We may disclose your personal information pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process in response to a request for cooperation from a court, law enforcement, or other government agency, and to comply with our other legal obligations.
  * **Other Circumstances:** We may disclose your personal information as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.



### **Information Security**

  * Your entire credit or debit card number is sent to the appropriate credit card company or bank during order processing, but we reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. 
  * We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to help protect transmissions of your payment card data over the Internet. You can confirm that SSL is in use by looking at the URL line of your browser—the first characters of the site address will change from “http” to “https.” If you are using a browser or firewall that does not permit communications through secure sites, you may not be able to make purchases on our Web site. 
  * Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or stored on a server can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personal information. If you prefer not to transmit your credit card number over the Internet, you should contact us at [support@wholetones.com](mailto:support@wholetones.com) or using the toll-free number listed on the Site.
