<b>
DNS and WHOIS - How it Works</b><br>
WHOIS databases are usually mainly run by registrars and registries which serve to point to the WHOIS server the responsible sub 
registry including providing an overview of the contract details of the registry. On the other hand, the DNS registry operators work to 
maintain another vital system, the authoritative name servers which usually holds the key to where exactly it is that a website is located. 
It is then after this that one of the name servers is contacted and in turn sends back the IP address for that domain name. 
In the end, the computer is therefore able to connect and in turn serve up the homepage. 

 Everything taken into consideration, it is very important to understand the fact that WHOIS is specifically designed in more of less the same way, 
for instance, once at the WHOIS platform, simply follow the references to the downstream WHO IS servers unless the required information is obtained. 
This process is illustrated for a thick registry and in the event that the registry is thin an additional process query is run at the registrars' database in 
a bid to obtain the WHOIS data for the domain name.

<b>"Whois" "domain name" "name servers" "dns"</b><br>


DNS simply refers to a hierarchical decentralized naming system meant for computer, 
services as well as any other resource that is connected to the internet or better yet a 
private network. It is associated with various information and has domain names assigned to each other of the participating entities. 
Most prominently, DNS normally serves to translate more readily memorized domain names into numerical IP addresses which are needed for 
the purpose of locating and identifying computer services as well as devices using the underlying network protocols. Simply put, by providing a worldwide,
 distributed directory service, the domain name system serves as an extremely essential component in the overall functionality of the internet. 

In addition to all of the above, it is also very important to note that the domain system usually delegates the responsibility of assigning domain
 names as well as mapping of those same names to the internet resources by simply designating authoritative name servers for each and every particular domain. 
This means, network administrators are therefore able to delegate authority over subdomains for their allocated name space onto other servers. 
It is equally important to note that this mechanism serves to provide distributed and fault tolerant service plus it is designed to help prevent even a single large central database. 

At the same time, it is also very important to note that the internet maintains two main name spaces, the first one is the domain name hierarchy and the second one
 is the IP address spaces. Just so you know, it is the domain name system which serves to provide the translation services to and fro. In short, a DNS name server stores 
DNS records for a domain and the in turn the DNS server responds with answers to queries against its databases.  

 <br><br>
<b>How to perform a WHOIS lookup on a domain name?</b><br>

WHOIS simply stands for "Who is?" it is a utility that is used to look up information on domain names. Just so you know, this includes contract information as 
well as some other technical pieces of information such as the domain name server's which form a crucial aspect of this service. You will be glad to learn that 
alongside it are additional status information such as if the domain is locked amongst other things.  

In order to make use of it, all you simply need to do is to enter the domain in the form and then proceed to carry out a WHOIS look up on it. It is also very 
important to note that there are some types of domains (TLDs) which will not show all information or in some cases will always fail to show any information from 
WHOIS utilities used outside the registry's Website for a particular type of domain name. 

In the event that you are not being shown all of the information available or worse off, no information is coming through at all simply check if there is an alternative 
WHOIS look up for the type of domain that you need information about. You will be happy to learn that there are sections of the look up platforms which explain in details some 
of the things which you need to know about domain names including what exactly some statues codes mean.
