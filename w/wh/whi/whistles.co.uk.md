·We share your information with our core service providers and third party platforms as required for our business to function; for example, to Clipper Logistics Group Ltd. who pick, package and process orders on our behalf, DHL who assist us with fulfilling deliveries, Cybersource who provide fraud detection services and credit risk reduction checks, and the third parties we engage to provide IT systems support.

·If you choose to provide feedback on your transaction, we will share your information with Feefo, a third party feedback site who will capture your feedback on transactions which we use to enhance our customer service.

·Your information may be processed by a third party in order to maintain the functionality of our website and database.

·In the event that you add items to your basket but do not complete a transaction, our abandon basket partner will automatically send you an e-mail to remind you that there are items in your basket.

·Whilst you are a member of our mailing list we may share your information with trusted non-core service providers, such as marketing partners we have carefully selected to deliver incentives to participate in offers, polls, surveys, analysis or research, all of which assist us in enhancing our services. They are not permitted to use your information after you unsubscribe.

·We also use services offered by Google, Facebook, Instagram and other similar social media platforms to better tailor our marketing communications and for targeted advertising. As part of this process, some personal information, such as your email address, is provided to the relevant third party, however for security purposes this data is “hashed” prior to being shared. Hashing is a process of identity masking or “pseudonymisation” which means we do not disclose your email but still enables linking between your social media presence and our website. Your personal information may be transmitted to countries outside of the EEA, including the United States. If you would like more information about how your personal information may be transmitted, please contact
