# Online Privacy & Security - White Flower Farm

  
**Your Privacy**

White Flower Farm respects the privacy of every individual who shops via our print or online gardening catalogue.

When you place an order online, all personal information you give White Flower Farm is kept absolutely private. We will not share or sell your name, postal address, or any other personal information you provide us to any outside companies or agencies.

For our gardening friends who choose to receive our occasional emails, rest assured we do not share, rent, or sell your email address to outside companies or agencies. Period.

If you receive our print catalogue or order via mail or telephone, there is a chance we will share your name with reputable third parties whose products might be of interest to you. If you do not want us to share your information with third parties, please email our customer service team at [custserv@whiteflowerfarm.com.](mailto:custserv@whiteflowerfarm.com) When you request a catalogue online, you are given the opportunity to opt-out of having your postal address shared.

White Flower Farm may use cookies to allow us to better service our customers. If you would like to erase all cookies at the end of every session or disable them entirely, please refer to your browser instructions on how to do so. Please note that disabling cookies will prevent you from placing items in your shopping cart, and you will not be able to order online. To order by phone, please call 1-800-503-9624 to reach one of our customer service associates. The Call Center is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern time Monday-Saturday; noon to 6 p.m. Sundays.

We save personally-identifiable information only when visitors place an order (when we must save name, address, and credit card information in order to process the order) or request a catalogue (when we use the name and address in order to deliver the catalogue). In order to improve our Web site and identify navigation problems, we save information about how visitors click-through our site, but that information is aggregate and not linked to personally-identifiable information.

**Your Security**

Orders placed through our Web site utilize SSL (secure socket layers) to protect credit card information so it cannot be read in transit. If you do not have a browser that supports SSL or you are not comfortable sending your credit card information online, then you may call (1-800-503-9624), fax (1-860-496-1418), or mail (White Flower Farm, PO Box 50, Litchfield CT 06759-9952) your order to us.
