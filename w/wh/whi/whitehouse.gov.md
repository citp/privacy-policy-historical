THE WHITE HOUSE MAINTAINS OFFICIAL PAGES OR ACCOUNTS ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES IN ORDER TO BETTER ENGAGE WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. YOUR ACTIVITY ON THOSE SITES IS GOVERNED BY THE THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE’S SECURITY AND PRIVACY POLICIES. USERS OF THIRD-PARTY SITES OFTEN SHARE INFORMATION WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC, USER COMMUNITY, AND/OR THE THIRD-PARTY OPERATING THE SITE. CONSEQUENTLY, YOU SHOULD REVIEW THE PRIVACY POLICIES OF THIRD-PARTY SITES BEFORE USING THEM AND ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND HOW YOUR INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED AND USED. YOU SHOULD ALSO ADJUST PRIVACY SETTINGS ON YOUR ACCOUNT ON ANY THIRD-PARTY SITE TO MATCH YOUR PREFERENCES.

FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF COMPLYING WITH THE [PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS ACT](https://www.archives.gov/about/laws/presidential-records.html), THE WHITE HOUSE ARCHIVES SOME INFORMATION THAT USERS SUBMIT OR PUBLISH WHEN ENGAGING WITH THE WHITE HOUSE THROUGH OFFICIAL WHITE HOUSE PAGES OR ACCOUNTS ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES (E.G., BY SENDING A MESSAGE, POSTING A COMMENT, “FOLLOWING,” “FRIENDING,” OR TAKING SIMILAR ACTIONS).

HOW INFORMATION IS USED

IF YOU CHOOSE TO PROVIDE US WITH INFORMATION, WE MAY USE THAT INFORMATION TO CONTACT YOU, RESPOND TO YOUR MESSAGE OR PETITION, OR PROVIDE YOU THE INFORMATION OR SERVICES YOU REQUESTED. IN ORDER TO SERVE YOU BETTER, WE MAY ANALYZE MULTIPLE SOURCES OF DATA YOU HAVE PROVIDED (FOR EXAMPLE, TO LOOK UP WHETHER YOU PREVIOUSLY CONTACTED THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT THE SAME TOPIC SO THAT WE DO NOT SEND YOU A DUPLICATIVE RESPONSE). WE MAY ALSO USE MESSAGES OR COMMENTS COLLECTED THROUGH WHITEHOUSE.GOV OR OFFICIAL SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES FOR OUR OWN PURPOSES, SUCH AS TO INFORM POLICY DECISIONS OR IN PUBLIC ADVOCACY.

WE MAY USE DATA YOU PROVIDE AND AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED DATA FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS TO ASSESS, FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT INFORMATION IS OF INTEREST TO USERS, TECHNICAL DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS, AND SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. THIS ALLOWS US TO MAKE GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR SITE AS WELL AS TO OFFER TAILORED CONTENT TO EMAIL SUBSCRIBERS (E.G., A FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE TO SUBSCRIBERS INTERESTED IN A SPECIFIC TOPIC BASED ON INFORMATION THEY HAVE PROVIDED OR AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED DATA).

SHARING OF THIS INFORMATION

INFORMATION YOU CHOOSE TO SHARE WITH THE WHITE HOUSE (DIRECTLY AND VIA THIRD PARTY SITES) MAY BE TREATED AS PUBLIC INFORMATION.

AND THE WE THE PEOPLE API ALLOWS PUBLIC ACCESS TO SOME WE THE PEOPLE SIGNATURE DATA.

IN SOME CASES, WE MAY SHARE INFORMATION YOU HAVE PROVIDED OR AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED INFORMATION WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IN RESPONSE TO LAWFUL LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUESTS OR TO PROTECT WHITEHOUSE.GOV FROM SECURITY THREATS.
