The Information We Collect.

We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way (for example, through surveys, questionnaires, information provided at registration and in the course of other communications with us). This includes information that can identify you (“personal information”).

When you register as a user of WhiteSmoke, you voluntarily provide information about yourself (such as name and e-mail address). In addition, when you use WhiteSmoke software or Services, the documents, text and information transmitted to us for analysis and correction is transferred to our servers, and this information may include personal information.

When you place an order on our site our merchant services provider requests certain personally identifiable information on the order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, e-mail address, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). The merchant services provider processing the order will use this information for billing purposes, for filling your orders and as described in the merchant services provider's privacy policy. If there is a problem in processing an order, we or they may use information provided at registration to contact you.

The amount of personally identifying information you provide is up to you, and you are not obligated to provide such information. However, your use of the Site or the Services may be affected if such information is not provided.

You may provide information on behalf of another entity. If you completed the registration or provide information on behalf of a certain entity, you represent to us that you were authorized by that entity to give us consent to use the submitted information.

If you sign up for our Affiliate program you are transferred to a third party site, all of the Personal Information is collected on the third party site and is governed by their privacy policy. Your personal information is then shared back with Whitesmoke for the purpose of fulfilling your request to become an Affiliate.

We also may collect certain non-personally identifying information when you visit our Site or use the Services, such as your IP address, the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system you are using and access times.

Surveys or Contests. We may provide you, from time to time, the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our Web site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you.

Cookies and other technologies

Cookies are small data text files and can be stored on your computer’s hard drive (if your Web browser permits). This website uses cookies for the following general purposes:

  * To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting our site.
  * To help measure and research the effectiveness of website features and offerings, advertisements, and email communications (by determining which emails you open and act upon).



The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to access certain of the functionality of Site or Services. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at [support@whitesmoke.com](mailto:support@whitesmoke.com).

The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company and service providers is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customer’s personally identifiable information.

Our Commitment to Security. Physical and electronic procedures have been put into place to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use personal information. These include use of firewalls, passwords and other measures.

Although we take measures we believe are appropriate to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Policy. Regardless of the precautions taken by you or by us, “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk.

When you enter sensitive information such as credit card number on our order form, our merchant services providers encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

Other Sites or Services. If any part of this website links you to other sites or enables the download of third party software, those sites, software or related services are not subject to this Privacy Policy. In addition, in some cases, certain services are made accessible by us and carry our branding but are not provided by or hosted by us. We recommend you examine the privacy statements posted on those other websites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information and other information, including their use of cookies or other technologies and contact them directly if you have any questions.
