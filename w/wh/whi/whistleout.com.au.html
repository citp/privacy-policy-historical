                We will ask you when we need information which personally identifies you. We will
                not collect such information unless you provide it voluntarily.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you provide us with personal information, you are authorising us to deal with
                that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>How Will We Protect Your Personal Information?</b></p>
            <p>
                WhistleOut takes all reasonable steps to ensure the security of our systems on which

                information held by WhistleOut.</p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, there are always risks involved in storing information by electronic
                means and WhistleOut will not be responsible for any unauthorised access to or use
                of your personal information.
