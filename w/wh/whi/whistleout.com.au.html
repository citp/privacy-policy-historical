<h2>The purpose of this policy</h2>
<p>WhistleOut is bound by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and has publicly committed to

<h2>How do we collect your personal information?</h2>
<p>WhistleOut will only collect Personal Information where the information is necessary
	for WhistleOut to perform one or more of its functions or activities. In this context,
	"collect" means gather, acquire or obtain by any means, information in circumstances
	where the individual is identifiable or identified.</p>
<p>Where possible, we collect your personal information directly from you, for example when:
</p><ul>
        <li>you contact us by phone, email or online;</li>
	<li>we place an order with a Service Provider for you;</li>
	<li>you inquire about a product or service displayed on our website</li>
	<li>you sign up for a promotion or you opt in to receive product information or alerts;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you feel that the information that we are requesting, either from our website
	(www.whistleout.com.au) or our sub domains', or in our discussions with you, is not
	information that you wish to provide, please feel free to raise this with
	us.</p>
WhistleOut collects Personal Information primarily to place an order or refer you to suppliers of
  products and services from companies listed on https://www.whistleout.com.au/, or a sub
  domain. This is a free and completely optional service. We will collect at a minimum:
<p></p>
<ul>
	<li>name of the contact person;</li>
	<li>email address and phone number;</li>
        <li>residential address; and</li>
	<li>nature of the products and services being sought from the supplier.</li>
</ul>
<p>WhistleOut will notify individuals (including, but not limited to, our customers)
	of the matters listed below before collecting any Personal Information:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the main reason that we are collecting Personal Information (this reason will be
		the Primary Purpose);</li>
	<li>other related Uses or Disclosures that we may make of the Personal Information
		(Secondary Purposes);</li>
	<li>our identity and how individuals can contact us, if this is not obvious;</li>
	<li>that individuals can access the Personal Information that WhistleOut holds about
		them;</li>
	<li>that individuals should contact us (even if they are not a customer) if wish to
		access or correct Personal Information collected by us or have any concerns in
		relation to Personal Information;</li>
	<li>the organisations or types of organisations to whom we usually Disclose the
		Personal Information including Related Bodies Corporates and contractors;</li>
	<li>the consequences (if any) for the individual if all or part of the Personal
		Information is not provided to WhistleOut.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, the use of any information you provide to WhistleOut which forms part
	of your enquiry with a third party is not within the control of WhistleOut. A copy of
	your personal information will be stored by WhistleOut and is subject to WhistleOut's
	privacy policy. Any referral which is passed by WhistleOut to third party is also
	subject to the third party's privacy policy.</p>
<p>You are not obliged to give us your Personal Information. If you would like to
	access any of our services or features of our website on an anonymous basis we will
	take reasonable steps to comply with your request. If at any time you provide personal
	information about anyone other than yourself, you warrant to us that you have that
	person's consent to provide such information for the purpose specified.</p>
<p>We do not collect Sensitive Information about you unless it is necessary and we have
	your consent or it is required by law or in accordance with the Act. Sensitive
	Information (if collected) is obtained through your use of our website or related
	means.</p>
<p>Other information is collected by automated methods. Other Information we
	collected may include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the Internet Protocol address and a component of the domain name used (e.g. .com
		or .net);</li>
	<li>the type of browser and operating system you used;</li>
	<li>the date and time you visited our website;</li>
	<li>the web pages or services you accessed at our website;</li>
	<li>the time spent on individual pages and our website overall; or</li>
	<li>information about your computer and Internet connections using cookies.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have integrated Google Analytics into our website (see
	https://www.google.com/analytics/ for details). This enables the collection of data
	about traffic on our website via a DoubleClick cookie in addition to data collected
	through the standard Google Analytics implementation. We may as part of the use of
	Google Analytics functionality switch on Display Advertising which enables features
	that are not available through standard implementations. This includes Remarketing ,
	Google Display Network Impression Reporting, DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration
	and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting , each as described by
	Google.</p>
<p>Importantly, we will not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable
	information with non-personally identifiable information previously collected from
	Display Advertising features that is based on the DoubleClick cookie unless we have
	given you notice of, and have your prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to, that
	merger. Using Ads Settings, visitors to our website can opt-out of Google Analytics for
	Display Advertising and customise Google Display Network ads. A Browser opt-out is
	available at: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a>.
	We use Google Analytics to obtain a more detailed understanding of our our website
	users and their potential needs. Data collected from such reports may be used to more
	accurately target marketing and advertising campaigns based on demographic information
	and more generally for the Primary Purpose and secondary purposes detailed in this
	Policy. We do not collect data on individuals by such methods; only aggregate data is
	used for planning purposes.</p>
<p>When dealing with independent contractors, WhistleOut collects information by phone
	in writing or through online forms. We will use this information to ensure that our
	independent contractors can perform work for WhistleOut in a safe and lawful manner. We
	collect the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>name;</li>
	<li>business address, email address and contact details;</li>
	<li>insurance details; and</li>
	<li>rates and fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>When dealing with job applicants, WhistleOut collects this information in the
	course of an online job application form, job interviews, telephone discussions,
	reference checks and in writing. WhistleOut will use this information to assess the
	suitability of applicants for a position. In the event that the job application is
	rejected, WhistleOut may keep the information to use in the event that an
	appropriate vacancy arises. We collects the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>name;</li>
	<li>address/contact details</li>
	<li>occupation;</li>
	<li>career history; and</li>
	<li>references.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>How do we use your personal information?</h2>
<p>We will not use your personal information for any purpose which is not
	related to the Primary Purpose for which it is collected. This includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a free and completely optional service to place an order or refer you to the supplier of the
		products and services that you requested;</li>
	<li>to provide you with further information about the products and services
		you requested;</li>
	<li>to personalise and customise your experiences with WhistleOut;</li>
	<li>to help WhistleOut to review, manage and enhance its services;</li>
	<li>to develop insights used in reports or other content developed by
		WhistleOut; and</li>
	<li>to communicate with you</li>
</ul>
<p>If you go to a third party's website via WhistleOut to complete a
	purchase, all information required by the seller of the product is collected
	from you, by the seller, using application forms on their site, via email or
	phone (as relevant) and not collected by WhistleOut.</p>
<p>For example, WhistleOut provides an optional enquiry form on a
	range of telecommunications products which is passed directly to
	the Service Provider listed in the enquiry form. The Service providers and product will
	be clearly identified in the enquiry form and the personal information
	submitted in the form will be used by the Service Provider to provide a personalised
	follow up call about your requirements. The personal information that you
	submit in this enquiry form is subject to the terms and conditions of this
	privacy policy. Enquiries in this category are only submitted to the Service Provider for the purposes of follow up on tour request and are not used by any
	third party partners in other categories.</p>
<p>In addition to the Primary Purpose, we may use the Personal
	Information we collect and you consent to WhistleOut using your Personal
	Information to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>provide individuals with relevant advertisements and relevant information
		about promotions, as well as the products and services of WhistleOut and other
		organisations;</li>
	<li>send you marketing and promotional material that you may be interested
		in;</li>
	<li>communicate with you, including by email, phone and mail;</li>
	<li>manage and enhance products or your experience on our website and the sub
		domains of WhistleOut;</li>
	<li>conduct surveys or promotions;</li>
	<li>verify your identity;</li>
	<li>investigate any complaints about, or made by you, or if we have reason to
		suspect you have breached any relevant terms and conditions; or</li>
	<li>as required or permitted by any law.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not use your personal information for any purpose for which
	you would not reasonably expect us to use your personal information. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that the personal
	information that we hold is accurate and up-to-date. If you feel that
	information about you is not accurate or your details have or are about to
	change, you can email us at privacy@whistleout.com and we will correct or
	update your personal information.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What happens if you choose not to provide your personal information?</h2>
<p>You are not obliged to give us your personal information. Most of our
	services are available on an anonymous basis. Where we do require personal
	information and you would like to access any of these services on an anonymous
	basis we will take all reasonable steps to comply with your request. However,
	if you choose not to provide WhistleOut with personal details, such as your
	name or email or phone number, the range of options available to you, may be
	limited.</p>
<p>For example, WhistleOut provides a function that allows you to request a
	call back, from a supplier of a service, listed on the website. Without a phone
	number or email we cannot successfully deliver this service.</p>
<hr>
<h2>When do we disclose your personal information?</h2>
<p>WhistleOut may disclose Personal Information and your consent to us
	disclosing such Personal Information to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the third party supplier of the products and services that you requested;</li>	
<li>third parties engaged by WhistleOut to perform functions or provide
		products or services on our or their behalf such as fulfilment of discounts
		deals, marketing or advertising;</li>
	<li>persons authorised by you to receive information held by
		WhistleOut;</li>
<li>law enforcement agencies or government authorities; and</li>
	<li>any persons as required or permitted by any law.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will generally be given the opportunity to "opt out" from receiving
	communications in accordance with this policy. You may "opt out" by:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Clicking a link on the email communications sent to you;</li>
