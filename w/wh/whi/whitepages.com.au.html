	<a name="principles"></a>
	</p><p><i><b>Pacific Access Pty Ltd's Privacy Principles</b></i><br>
	Pacific Access Pty Ltd operates in accordance with the following corporate privacy principles:
	</p><p><b>Principle 1: Collection of information</b><br>
	</p><p>Personal information will only be collected to the extent necessary by lawful and fair means, for one or more specified purposes which are relevant to Pacific Access's operations.
	</p><p>When personal information is collected directly from the individual to whom it relates the purpose of collection will be identified and it will only be collected with the person's consent.

	</p><p><b>Principle 2: Use of information</b><br>
	Personal information will only be used for:<br>
	a)	a purpose for which it was collected or for a directly related purpose;<br>
	b)	improvement of customer service;<br>
	c)	the derivation of anonymous or aggregated information;<br>
	d)	the prevention or lessening of a threat to the life or health of the individual concerned or another person;<br>
	e)	purposes permitted, required or authorised by or under law;<br>
	f)	the enforcement of the criminal law or of a law imposing a pecuniary penalty or for the protection of public revenue, where the use is reasonably necessary, or;<br>
	g) any other purpose, where the person concerned has consented to its use for that purpose.<br>

	</p><p><b>Principle 3: Disclosure of information</b><br>
	Personal information will not be disclosed to a third party unless:<br>
	a)	the person concerned has consented to the disclosure;<br>
	b)	the third party is an agent or contractor of Pacific Access and is required to keep the information confidential and to use the information only for the purpose for which it was disclosed;<br>
	c)	it is the usual practice of Pacific Access to pass information to a third party and the individual from whom the information was collected was notified of this practice at the time of collection;<br>
	d)	there are reasonable grounds to believe that disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a threat to the life or health of the individual concerned or another person;<br>
	e)	the disclosure is permitted, required or authorised by or under law, or;<br>
	f)	the disclosure is reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the criminal law or a law imposing a	pecuniary penalty, or for the protection of public revenue.<br>

	</p><p><b>Principle 4: Data quality</b><br>
	Prior to the use and disclosure of personal information, reasonable steps will be taken to ensure that personal information is relevant and to the extent necessary, accurate, complete and up to date for the purpose for which it is to be used.
	
	</p><p><b>Principle 5: Data security</b><br>
	Safeguards will be maintained to protect personal information against unauthorised access, alteration, destruction, use or disclosure and against accidental loss.
	
	</p><p><b>Principle 6: Openness</b><br>
	Pacific Access will have clearly expressed policies on its management of personal information and these will continue to be readily available.  Pacific Access will take reasonable steps to let individuals know, generally, what sort of personal information it holds, for what purposes, and how it collects, uses, and discloses that information.
	
	</p><p><b>Principle 7: Access and correction</b><br>
	Where Pacific Access holds personal information about an individual, it will provide the individual with access to the information on request, in a form or manner suitable to the individual's reasonable needs, except to the extent that:
	</p><p>
	(a)	providing access would pose a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of any individual; or<br>
	(b)	providing access would have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of other individuals; or<br>
	(c)	the request for access is frivolous or vexatious; or<br>
	(d)	the information relates to existing legal dispute resolution proceedings between Pacific Access and the individual, and the information would not be accessible by the process of discovery in those proceedings; or<br>
	(e)	providing access would reveal the intentions of Pacific Access in relation to negotiations with the individual in such a way as to prejudice those negotiations; or<br>
	(f)	providing access would be unlawful; or<br>
	(g)	denying access is specifically authorised by law; or<br>
	(h)	providing access would be likely to prejudice an investigation of possible unlawful activity; or<br>
	(i)	providing access would be likely to prejudice:<br>
		</p><div class="margin2">(i)	the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of</div>
			<div class="margin4">(a)	criminal offences; or</div>
			<div class="margin4">(b)	breaches of a law imposing a penalty or sanction</div>
		<div class="margin2">(ii)	the enforcement of laws relating to the confiscation of the proceeds of crime;</div>
		<div class="margin2">(iii)	the protection of the public revenue;</div>
		<div class="margin2">(iv)	the prevention, detection, investigation or remedying of Seriously Improper Conduct; or</div>
		<div class="margin2">(v)	preparation for, or conduct of, proceedings before any court or tribunal, or implementation of its orders; by or on behalf of an enforcement agency; or</div>
	(j) ASIO, ASIS or an enforcement agency performing a lawful national security function asks Pacific Access not to provide access on the basis that providing access would be likely to cause damage to the national security of Australia.<br>
	
	<p>Where providing access would reveal evaluative information generated within Pacific Access in connection with a commercially sensitive decision-making process, Pacific Access may give the individual an explanation for the decision, rather than direct access to the information.
	</p><p>If Pacific Access has given an individual such an explanation and the individual believes that direct access to the evaluative information is necessary to provide a reasonable explanation of the reasons for the decision, Pacific Access will, at the request of the individual, undertake a review of the decision.  The review will be undertaken by personnel other than the original decision maker.
	</p><p>Wherever direct access by the individual is impractical or inappropriate, Pacific Access and the individual should consider whether the use of mutually agreed intermediaries would allow sufficient access to meet the needs of both parties.
	</p><p>If Pacific Access levies charges for providing access to personal information, those charges:<br>
	(a)	will not be excessive; and<br>
	(b)	will not apply to lodging a request for access.<br>
	</p><p>If Pacific Access holds personal information about an individual and the individual is able to establish that the information is not accurate, complete and up-to-date, Pacific Access will take reasonable steps to correct the information so that it is accurate, complete and up-to-date.
	</p><p>If the individual and Pacific Access disagree about whether the information is accurate, complete and up-to-date, and the individual asks Pacific Access to associate with the information a statement claiming that the information is not accurate, complete or up-to-date, Pacific Access will take reasonable steps to do so. Pacific Access will provide reasons for denial of access or correction.
	
	</p><p><b>Principle 8: Identifiers</b><br>
	Pacific Access will not adopt as its own identifier an identifier that has been assigned by a government agency (or by an agent of, or contractor to, a government agency acting in its capacity as agent or contractor). Pacific Access will not use or disclose an identifier assigned to an individual by a government agency except where paragraphs (c) to (f) of Principle 3 apply.
	
	</p><p><b>Principle 9: Anonymity</b><br>
	Whenever it is lawful and practicable, individuals will have the option of not identifying themselves when dealing with Pacific Access.
	
	</p><p><b>Principle 10: Transborder data flows</b><br>
	Pacific Access will not transfer personal data outside Australia unless:<br>
	(a)	Pacific Access reasonably believes that the recipient of the information is subject to a statute, binding scheme or contract which effectively upholds principles for fair information handling that are substantially similar to these rules; or<br>
	(b)	the individual concerned consents to the transfer; or<br>
	(c)	the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the individual concerned and Pacific Access, or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken in respect to the individual's request; or<br>
	(d)	the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest of the individual concerned between Pacific Access and a third party; or<br>
	(e)	the transfer is for the benefit of the individual concerned; and<br>
		</p><div class="margin2">(i)	it is not practicable to obtain the consent of the subject of the information to that transfer; and</div>
		<div class="margin2">(ii)	if it were practicable to obtain such consent, the subject of the information would give it; or</div>
	(f)	Pacific Access has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information which it has transferred will not be collected, held, used or disclosed by the recipient of the information inconsistently with these rules.<br>
	
	<p><b>Principle 11: Sensitive information</b><br>
	Pacific Access will not collect personal information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or details of health, disability or sexual activity or orientation unless:<br>
	(a)	the subject of the information has consented; or<br>
	(b)	the collection is required or specifically authorised by law; or<br>
	(c)	the collection is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of any individual, where the subject of the information is physically or legally incapable of giving consent; or<br>
	(d)	the collection is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim.<br>
	
	</p><p><b>Principle 12: New services and development</b><br>
	 Pacific Access will consider the privacy impact of new services before they are introduced.
	</p><p>Where appropriate, customers will be permitted to choose between various degrees of privacy protection in respect of these new services.
	
	</p><p><b>Principle 13: Compliance audit</b><br>
	Pacific Access may maintain an independent compliance audit program to ensure its privacy protection principles and policies remain appropriate, and that Pacific Access operates in compliance with those principles and policies.
