Our commitment to privacy  
Aside from the contents of this statement, Sensis Pty Ltd's conduct in the online environment is also governed by a number of statutory and non-statutory policies as part of the telecommunications industry, and our corporate privacy principles.   
Statutory and non-statutory requirements  
Sensis Pty is part of the Telecommunications Industry and as such, is governed by: 

  1. The Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth) and industry codes; 
  2. The National Privacy Principles contained in Schedule 3 of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth); 
  3. Various current and proposed privacy regimes; 
  4. Laws and codes regulating and protecting Internet content; and 
  5. Some non-statutory industry codes such as the Australian Direct Marketing Association (ADMA) code of practice. 



Sensis also has its own policies and procedures designed to ensure that personal information is protected.   
  
Sensis Pty Ltd's Privacy Principles  
Sensis Pty Ltd operates in accordance with the following corporate privacy principles: 

**_Principle 1:_ Collection of information**  
Sensis collects personal information in a number of ways, including: 

  * directly from you, when you provide information by phone or in documents such as an application form; 
  * from third parties such as our related companies, carriage service providers, credit reporting agencies or your representatives; 
  * from publicly available sources of information; 
  * from the organisations identified below under "When we disclose your personal information"; 
  * from our own records of how you use our services; or 
  * when legally required to do so. 



**_Principle 2:_ Use of information**  
Your personal information may be used in order to: 

  * provide the services you require, including directory services, through a number of media; 
  * administer and manage those services, including charging, billing and collecting debts; 
  * inform you of ways the services provided to you could be improved; 
  * conduct appropriate checks for credit-worthiness and for fraud; 
  * research and develop our services; 
  * gain an understanding of your information and communication needs in order for us to provide you with a better service; 
  * maintain and develop our business systems and infrastructure, including testing and upgrading of these systems; 

Your personal information is also collected to promote and market other services which we consider may be of interest to you. If you do not wish us to contact you regarding other services please call 1800 039 059. 

**_Principle 3:_ Disclosure of information**  
For the purposes set out above we may disclose your personal information to organisations outside Sensis. The organisations to which we disclose information include: 

  * Telstra Corporation and other related companies; 
  * outsourced service providers who manage the services we provide to you, including: 
    * customer enquiries; 
    * mailing systems; 
    * billing and debt-recovery functions; 
    * information technology services; 
    * marketing, telemarketing and door-knocking services; 
    * market research; 
  * your representatives (eg your authorised representatives or legal advisers); 
  * credit-reporting and fraud-checking agencies; 
  * credit providers for credit related purposes such as creditworthiness, credit rating, credit provision and financing; 
  * our professional advisers, including our accountants, auditors and lawyers; 
  * government and regulatory authorities and other organisations, as required or authorised by law; 
  * organisations involved in: 
    * a transfer/sale of all or part of our assets or business (including accounts and trade receivables); and 
    * managing our corporate risk and funding functions (eg securitisation). 
  * other telecommunication and information service providers. 



**_Principle 4:_ Data quality**  
Prior to the use and disclosure of personal information, reasonable steps will be taken to ensure that personal information is relevant and to the extent necessary, accurate, complete and up to date for the purpose for which it is to be used. 

**_Principle 5:_ Data security**  
Safeguards will be maintained to protect personal information against unauthorised access, alteration, destruction, use or disclosure and against accidental loss. 

**_Principle 6:_ Openness**  
Sensis will have clearly expressed policies on its management of personal information and these will continue to be readily available. Sensis will take reasonable steps to let individuals know, generally, what sort of personal information it holds, for what purposes, and how it collects, uses, and discloses that information. 

**_Principle 7:_ Access and correction**  
Where Sensis holds personal information about an individual, it will provide the individual with access to the information on request, in a form or manner suitable to the individual's reasonable needs, except to the extent that: 

  * providing access would pose a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of any individual; or 
  * providing access would have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of other individuals; or 
  * the request for access is frivolous or vexatious; or 
  * the information relates to existing legal dispute resolution proceedings between Sensis and the individual, and the information would not be accessible by the process of discovery in those proceedings; or 
  * providing access would reveal the intentions of Sensis in relation to negotiations with the individual in such a way as to prejudice those negotiations; or 
  * providing access would be unlawful; or 
  * denying access is specifically authorised by law; or 
  * providing access would be likely to prejudice an investigation of possible unlawful activity; or 
  * providing access would be likely to prejudice: 
    * the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of 
      * criminal offences; or 
      * breaches of a law imposing a penalty or sanction 
    * the enforcement of laws relating to the confiscation of the proceeds of crime; 
    * the protection of the public revenue; 
    * the prevention, detection, investigation or remedying of Seriously Improper Conduct; or 
    * preparation for, or conduct of, proceedings before any court or tribunal, or implementation of its orders; by or on behalf of an enforcement agency; or 
  * ASIO, ASIS or an enforcement agency performing a lawful national security function asks Sensis not to provide access on the basis that providing access would be likely to cause damage to the national security of Australia.  




Where providing access would reveal evaluative information generated within Sensis in connection with a commercially sensitive decision-making process, Sensis may give the individual an explanation for the decision, rather than direct access to the information. 

If Sensis has given an individual such an explanation and the individual believes that direct access to the evaluative information is necessary to provide a reasonable explanation of the reasons for the decision, Sensis will, at the request of the individual, undertake a review of the decision. The review will be undertaken by personnel other than the original decision maker. 

Wherever direct access by the individual is impractical or inappropriate, Sensis and the individual should consider whether the use of mutually agreed intermediaries would allow sufficient access to meet the needs of both parties. 

If Sensis levies charges for providing access to personal information, those charges: 

  * will not be excessive; and 
  * will not apply to lodging a request for access. 



If Sensis holds personal information about an individual and the individual is able to establish that the information is not accurate, complete and up-to-date, Sensis will take reasonable steps to correct the information so that it is accurate, complete and up-to-date. 

If the individual and Sensis disagree about whether the information is accurate, complete and up-to-date, and the individual asks Sensis to associate with the information a statement claiming that the information is not accurate, complete or up-to-date, Sensis will take reasonable steps to do so. Sensis will provide reasons for denial of access or correction. 

**_Principle 8:_ Identifiers**  
Sensis will not adopt as its own identifier an identifier that has been assigned by a government agency (or by an agent of, or contractor to, a government agency acting in its capacity as agent or contractor). Sensis will not use or disclose an identifier assigned to an individual by a government agency except where paragraphs (c) to (f) of Principle 3 apply. 

**_Principle 9:_ Anonymity**  
Whenever it is lawful and practicable, individuals will have the option of not identifying themselves when dealing with Sensis. 

**_Principle 10:_ Transborder data flows**  
Sensis will not transfer personal data outside Australia unless:  


  * Sensis reasonably believes that the recipient of the information is subject to a statute, binding scheme or contract which effectively upholds principles for fair information handling that are substantially similar to these rules; or 
  * the individual concerned consents to the transfer; or 
  * the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the individual concerned and Sensis, or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken in respect to the individual's request; or 
  * the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest of the individual concerned between Sensis and a third party; or 
  * the transfer is for the benefit of the individual concerned; and 
    * it is not practicable to obtain the consent of the subject of the information to that transfer; and 
    * if it were practicable to obtain such consent, the subject of the information would give it; or 
  * Sensis has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information which it has transferred will not be collected, held, used or disclosed by the recipient of the information inconsistently with these rules. 



**_Principle 11:_ Sensitive information**  
Sensis will not collect personal information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or details of health, disability or sexual activity or orientation unless: 

  * the subject of the information has consented; or  

  * the collection is required or specifically authorised by law; or  

  * the collection is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of any individual, where the subject of the information is physically or legally incapable of giving consent; or 
  * the collection is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim.  




**_Principle 12:_ New services and development**  
Sensis will consider the privacy impact of new services before they are introduced. 

Where appropriate, customers will be permitted to choose between various degrees of privacy protection in respect of these new services. 

**_Principle 13:_ Compliance audit**  
Sensis may maintain an independent compliance audit program to ensure its privacy protection principles and policies remain appropriate, and that Sensis operates in compliance with those principles and policies.

What else should you know about privacy?  
Here are some more pointers to assist you in further protecting you privacy on the Internet. 

Remember to close your browser when you have finished your user session. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. You, as an individual, are responsible for the security of and access to your own computer. 

Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information over the Internet (for example: in discussion forums, via email or in chat sites) that this information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information in publicly accessible online fora you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. 

Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your username and passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are using the Internet and Sensis Pty Ltd or any of its affiliated sites.
