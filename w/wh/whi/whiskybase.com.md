Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. 

For the purpose of European Union General Data Protection Regulation 2016 (the "GDPR"), the data controller is Whiskybase BV (NL) with its registered office at Zwaanshals 530, 3035KS Rotterdam, Netherlands.

Short form: We don't share your data and / or information with other companies except to create analytics or use their services. Nobody will receive your information for any other reason.

 **Information We May Collect From You  
** We may collect and process the following data about you: 

Information that you provide by filling in forms on our site https://whiskybase.com and associated application programming interface (collectively, our site). This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our site, subscribing to our service, posting material, requesting further services, and adding/amending information in your account. We may also ask you for information when you report a problem with our site. If you register for an account with us, we will ask for your username, your email address, a password (to be stored in an encrypted format), country of residence and optionally if you would like to receive a newsletter, at the time of registration. After you register for an account with us, we may also ask for details concerning your interest, such as tasting notes, ratings, reviews and your personal whisky collection. For the Market we also ask for your PayPal information, first and lastname and your address. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence. This includes email messages and their attachments, records of phone calls and postal mail that we receive from you. 

We may ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them. Details of transactions you carry out through our site and of the fulfilment of your orders. 

Details of your visits to our site including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise and the resources that you access. When you enter payment information, such as your credit card number, these are processed by our payment processor (Stripe Payments, Multisafepay or PayPal depending on your choice of payment method) and we do not process or store your full unmasked payment information. We may store and process your PayPal account email address. 

The data we collect and process is strictly limited to that which is necessary for us to provide our service to you under the lawful bases of consent and/or necessity. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password or access credentials which enable you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. 

IP Addresses 

We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and analytical information. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual. If you register for an account with us, we may use your IP address at the time of registration for "geolocation" (meaning that we will infer your likely country of location, based on your IP address). Such geolocation is limited to the country level, and is not guaranteed to be accurate. We will provide you the opportunity to correct or remove this information if you wish. 

Sensitive Information 

We do not request or otherwise collect or store any sensitive personal data as defined under the GDPR (for example: data consisting of racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health, gender or sexual orientation), whether in aggregate or linked to any person or account. If we become aware of any such data being stored or processed in our systems, we will take reasonable steps to erase it. 

Cookies 

Our website uses specific cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our site. For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them see our Cookie Notice.

 **Where We Store Your Personal Data  **

Our entire site is available over secure SSL (HTTPS) connection. Information that you provide to us by filling in forms on our site is therefore transferred from your web browser or server using SSL encryption. 

When you enter payment information, such as your credit card number, these are processed by our payment processor (Stripe Payments, Multisafepay or PayPal depending on your choice of payment method). The checkout page and/or specific form fields where you enter such information are served directly from their secure servers, and we do not process, receive or store your full unmasked payment details. 

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. We maintain confidentiality and privacy agreements with any members of staff having access to such information to ensure compliance with the GDPR and other relevant data protection law. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our codes of practice. 

Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, including the use of SSL technology, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
