    The website located at <a href="https://www.whistleout.com/">www.whistleout.com</a> (this <b>Site</b>) is operated under exclusive licence by WhistleOut Pty Ltd (ABN 14 130 446 267) (<b>WhistleOut</b>). You may have been referred to the
                Site from the website of one of our referral partners so it is important that you understand that the Site is controlled and operated by WhistleOut and
                not by the owner or controller of the website from which you have been referred. References in this Privacy Policy to the Site mean either the main website
                operated by WhistleOut currently located at <a href="https://www.whistleout.com/">www.whistleout.com</a>
    or a sub domain carrying the comparison and ranking service in respect of various goods and services offered by WhistleOut to which you have been referred
                from the website of one of our referral partners, whichever is relevant in the context. WhistleOut is firmly committed to maintaining your privacy by
                dealing with personal information in accordance with all applicable laws.
</p>
<p>
    The following privacy policy (<b>Privacy Policy</b>) outlines the type of information we will collect from you, how we may use that information, whether
                we may disclose such information to a third party, and your ability to update or correct such information.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Scope of Privacy Policy</b>
</p>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy applies solely to this Site, and does not apply to third party websites that are linked from or to this Site. We encourage you to
                carefully read the privacy policies of such third party websites.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Your Consent to this Privacy Policy</b>
</p>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy is in addition to and to be read in conjunction with this Site's Terms and Conditions of Use which can be found at
                <a href="https://www.whistleout.com/Terms-Of-Use">Terms of Use</a>. If you do not agree with any of the terms of our Privacy Policy, please leave the Site immediately.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Non-Personal Information</b>
</p>
<p>
    WhistleOut collects information about our site visitors collectively, including which sections of the Site and which products on the Site are most frequently
                visited, how often and for how long.
</p>
<p>
    This data is always used as aggregated, non-personal information.
</p>
<p>
    WhistleOut utilises this information to improve and enhance our services by monitoring the areas on the Site which are most popular to you and by showing
                lists of popular products to other users.
</p>
<p>
    This aggregated, non-personal information may be shared with WhistleOut's partners to provide them with an overview of how WhistleOut visitors use the
                site. This is done for the purposes of providing you with the best online comparison services.
</p>
<p>
    <b>IP Addresses</b>
</p>
<p>
    WhistleOut's web servers gather your IP address to assist with the diagnosis of problems or support issues with our services. Again, information is gathered
                in aggregate only and cannot be traced to an individual user.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Cookies </b>
</p>
<p>
    WhistleOut uses cookies to provide you with a better comparison experience in serving the correct CSS template for the WhistleOut powered site that you
                are using.
</p>
<p>
    We use cookies to track sales transactions with a range of different partner sites as part of our commission process.
</p>
<p>
    Users who do not wish to receive cookies can instruct their web browsers to refuse them but this may limit the features of this Site which are available
                to you.
</p>
<p>
    Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to this website. You have the option to opt out of Google's
                use of cookies by visiting the <a href="https://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">Google advertising opt-out page</a>. Alternatively you can opt out
                of cookies by visiting the <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">Network Advertising Initiative opt out page</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Third Party Measurement</b>
</p>
<p>
    In order to better understand our users, WhistleOut's partners utilise third party measurement companies, Nielsen // NetRatings, and Google Analytics
                to assess Site traffic.
</p>
<p>
    A tracking code is used to collect the information on the usage of the WhistleOut including (but not limited to) the following:
</p>
<p>
    (a) the number of page views (or page impressions)
</p>
<p>
    (b) the number of unique visitors
</p>
<p>
    (c) how long these unique visitors (on average) spend
</p>
<p>
    (d) common entry and exit points
</p>
<p>
    This is also aggregate, non-personal information and is collated and provided to WhistleOut to assist in analysing the usage of the Site. This data is
                also accessible by media organisations and research companies, for the purpose of conducting industry comparisons with other Internet websites.
</p>
<p>
    <b>How Will Your Personal Information Be Used?</b>
</p>
<p>
    WhistleOut collects information with the aim of providing you with the best quality and ease of service when visiting this Site. We use the information
                you provide to us to evaluate and improve our services. We may develop and use, in our sole discretion, consumer research which may be based on your use
                of our services. If you indicate your agreement to be contacted for this purpose, we may also use your personal information to contact you from time to
                time with information about goods or services which we think may be of interest to you. If we run competitions and ask you to provide us with personal
                information when entering such competitions, we may also use your personal information to administer such competitions and to notify prize winners.
</p>
<p>
    <b>How Do We Collect Your Personal Information?</b>
</p>
<p>
    We will ask you when we need information which personally identifies you. We will not collect such information unless you provide it voluntarily.
</p>
<p>
    When you provide us with personal information, you are authorising us to deal with that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    <b>How Will We Protect Your Personal Information?</b>
</p>
<p>
    WhistleOut takes all reasonable steps to ensure the security of our systems on which your personal information may be stored including the use of secure
                servers that are protected in controlled facilities. Our employees and contractors with potential access to personal information are required to respect
                the confidentiality of personal information held by WhistleOut.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, there are always risks involved in storing information by electronic means and WhistleOut will not be responsible for any unauthorised
                access to or use of your personal information.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Purchases with Third Parties</b>
</p>
<p>
    Making an online application or purchase by using a link from the Site, or by using a phone number listed on the Site, is free and optional.
</p>
<p>
    All information required by the seller of the product is collected from you by the seller using application forms on their site or on the phone call (as
                relevant) and not by WhistleOut.
</p>
<p>
    The use of any information you provide to such third parties is not within the control of WhistleOut and WhistleOut cannot accept responsibility for the
                acts or omissions of such third parties.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Your Right to Access and Modify Your Personal Information</b>
</p>
<p>
    Subject to some exceptions, you have the right to request access to any personal information relating to you that held by WhistleOut in accordance with
                applicable laws. Ordinarily, a copy of the personal information held by WhistleOut electronically or in files can be provided for nominal postage and
                handling fees.
</p>
<p>
    If you:
</p>
<p>
    (a) wish to access the personal information relating to you that is held by WhistleOut; or
</p>
<p>
    (b) wish to update personal information relating to you that is held by WhistleOut because you believe that information is incorrect or out of date; or
</p>
<p>
    (c) no longer wish to have personal information relating to you held by WhistleOut,
</p>
<p>
    you will need to make a written request by email to <a href="mailto:privacy@whistleout.com">privacy@whistleout.com</a> with sufficient details for WhistleOut to identify you, and to contact you in the event that WhistleOut requires further confirmation of your identity.
</p>
<p>
    By requesting that WhistleOut cease holding personal information relating to you, you acknowledge and agree that WhistleOut will cease the provision of
                all services to you requiring such information. WhistleOut will then take all reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information relating to you
                is destroyed or de-identified by secure means.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b>
</p>
<p>
    WhistleOut will review and update this Privacy Policy periodically to ensure that WhistleOut complies with current laws and legislation for the best protection
                of your online privacy. If we decide to change this Policy, we will post these changes on the site.
</p>
<p>
