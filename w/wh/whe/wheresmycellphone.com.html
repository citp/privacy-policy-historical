  <p class="style3"><strong>We Protect Your Privacy<br>
    </strong>Über Systems, LLC believes that  privacy is important to the success and use of the Internet. This statement  sets forth Über Systems, LLC's Privacy Statement and describes  the practices that Über Systems, LLC will follow with respect to the privacy of  users of this Site.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>What is personally identifiable information?<br>
  </strong>"Customer identifiable information" is information which can be  associated with a specific individual or entity, such as name, address, e-mail  address, user ID, credit card number, social security number, and so on.</p>
  <p class="style3"><strong>How is this information collected,  used, and disclosed?<br>
    </strong>Recognition of a Customer's  Expectation of Privacy: At Über Systems, LLC, we believe the confidentiality and  protection of customer information is one of our fundamental responsibilities.  And while information is critical to providing quality service, we recognize  one of our most important assets is our customers' trust. Thus, the safekeeping  of customer information is a priority for Über Systems, LLC.<br>
    <br>
    We do not collect personal information at all.&nbsp;  The only thing we collect is your unique IP address, which cannot be  used to identify you personally, in order to regulate use of our services.&nbsp; This cache is cleared on a regular basis to  improve site performance and protect your privacy.<br>
    <br>
    If you have voluntarily provided  information, you consented to the collection and use of your personally  identifiable information as described in this Privacy Statement. We do not sell  or rent personal information collected through this site to anyone. However, Über Systems, LLC  may provide aggregate statistics about visitors to our Sites, such as volume,  traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party  vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifiable  information. Über Systems, LLC may also disclose information in special cases  when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform  to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect and defend our  rights or property; (c) enforce the Web site Terms and Conditions of Use; or  (d) act to protect the interests of our users or others.<br>
    <br>
    Use, Collection and Retention of Customer Information: Über Systems, LLC limits  the use, collection and retention of customer information to what we believe is  necessary or useful to conduct our business, provide quality service, and offer  products, services and other opportunities that may be of interest to our  customers.<br>
    <br>
    Über Systems, LLC servers  automatically gather information about which pages are visited within the Über Systems, LLC  Web Site. We do not use that information except in the aggregate.<br>
    <br>
    Maintenance of Accurate Information: Über Systems, LLC recognizes that it must  maintain accurate customer records. Therefore, Über Systems, LLC has established  procedures to maintain the accuracy of customer information and to keep such  information current and complete. These procedures include responding to  requests to correct inaccurate information in a timely manner.<br>
    <br>
  Protection of Information via Established Security Procedures: Über Systems, LLC  recognizes that a fundamental element of maintaining effective customer privacy  procedures is to provide reasonable protection against the unauthorized access  to customer information. Therefore, Über Systems, LLC has established appropriate  security standards and procedures to guard access to customer information.  Disclosure of Privacy Principles to Customers: Über Systems, LLC recognizes and  respects the privacy expectations of our customers. We want our customers to  understand our commitment to privacy in our use of customer information. As a  result of our commitment, we have developed these Privacy Principles which are  made readily available to our customers. Customers who have questions about  these Privacy Principles or have a question about the privacy of their customer  information should call Über Systems, LLC.</p>
  <p class="style3"><strong>What are cookies and how are they  used?<br>
    </strong>Some Über Systems, LLC Sites, like  many other commercial web sites, may utilize a standard technology called  "cookies" to collect information about how our site is used. Cookies  were designed to help a web site operator determine that a particular user had  visited the site previously and thus save and remember any preferences that may  have been set while the user was browsing the site. Cookies are small strings  of text that web sites can send to your browser. Cookies cannot retrieve any other  data from your hard drive or obtain your e-mail address. If you are simply  browsing a Über Systems, LLC informational site, a cookie may be used to identify  your browser as one that has visited the site before.<br>
    <br>
  We may also make use of memory-based cookies in support of authenticating the  user of certain Über Systems, LLC web applications. Similarly, if you are a  registered user of a site providing service to Über Systems, LLC clients (and  have a user ID and password), we may use cookies so that we can provide  personalized information based on preferences you have indicated while using  the site. Although you have the ability to modify your browser to either accept  all cookies, notify you when a cookie is sent, or reject all cookies, it may  not be possible to utilize Über Systems, LLC services which require registration  if you reject cookies.</p>
  <p class="style3"><strong>What are your choices regarding  collection, use, and distribution of your information?<br>
    </strong>If you have voluntarily provided  information, you consented to the collection and use of your personally  identifiable information as described in this Privacy Statement. If, in  connection with your use of a particular service, we ask to use your data in a  way not described in this Privacy Statement and you do not wish to permit that  use, you can choose not to use the particular service.<br>
    <br>
  If you have voluntarily provided personally identifiable information, we may,  from time to time, send you mail or e-mail regarding products and services. If  you do not want to receive such offers and mailings, you can easily indicate  that by checking the appropriate box on the submission form.</p>
  <p class="style3"><strong>How do we protect your information?<br>
    </strong>We exercise great care to protect  your personally identifiable information. This includes, among other things,  using industry standard techniques such as firewalls, encryption, intrusion  detection and site monitoring. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the  Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to  protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot ensure or warrant  the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us. This is  especially true for information you transmit to us via e-mail. We have no way  of protecting that information until it reaches us. Once we receive your  transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our servers.<br>
    <br>
    Internally, we will restrict access to your personally identifiable information  to employees who need access to the information in order to do their jobs.  These employees are limited in number and are committed to our privacy  policies.<br>
    <br>
  We will review our security arrangements from time to time as we deem  appropriate.</p>
  <p class="style3"><strong>How can you help protect your  information?<br>
    </strong>If you are using an Über Systems, LLC  web site for which you registered and chose a password, which may be utilized, we recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. We  will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an  unsolicited e-mail. Also remember to sign out of the registered site and close  your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that  others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if others  have access to your computer. <strong>Other sites<br>
    </strong>Über Systems, LLC Sites may contain  links to other sites, including those of our business partners. While we seek  to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we  are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by other sites. <br>
    <em>These Privacy Principles apply to  individuals, and we reserve the right to change these Privacy Principles, and  any of the policies or procedures described above, at any time without prior  notice. These Privacy Principles are for general guidance and do not constitute  a contract or create legal rights and do not modify or amend any agreements we  have with our customers. </em> <br>
