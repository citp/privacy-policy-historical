PRIVACY POLICY

As a Site dealing with medical information, protecting Member privacy is a top concern of Track Your Plaque (TYP). The operation of this Site relies on information that is collected automatically and that is provided by its Members. The Site Privacy Policy is designed to protect and inform you about how this information is used. 

AUTOMATIC INFORMATION COLLECTION

_Internet Activity:_ The Site may automatically collect certain non-identifiable information regarding Web site users, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer, the IP address of your Internet Service Provider, the date and time you access the Site, the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to the Site, the operating system you are using, the sections of the Site you visit, the Site's pages read and images viewed, and the content you download from the Site. This non-identifiable information is used for Web site and system administration purposes. Your non-identifiable information may be disclosed to others and permanently archived for future use. 

_Cookies:_ The Site may receive and store information when you visit or shop with the Site. The Site may use "cookies," a technology that installs a small amount of information in the form of text on a user's computer. This text permits the Site to recognize future visits using that computer. Cookies enhance the convenience and use of the Site, as well as facilitate your Web site experience, while helping the Site to analyze traffic data to make improvements to better meet the needs of our customers. You may choose to decline cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may affect your use of the Site and your ability to access certain features of the Site or engage in transactions through the Site. 

MEMBER PROVIDED INFORMATION (MPI)

This Site receives and stores information Members enter or provide in various ways. Failing to provide information at particular areas on the Site may limit your ability to take advantage of the Site's unique features. The information you provide can help us to respond to your requests and/or suggestions for improving the Site, customizing your experience, establishing and improving communications with you and all of our Members. 

TYP allows Members to modify and delete all MPI online or request removal and modification by sending an email to contact@trackyourplaque.com with instructions on what information to delete or modify. 

_Personally Identifiable Information (PII):_ PII is considered to be any Member Provided Information that would allow others to personally identify you. Names, street addresses, telephone numbers, and e-mail addresses are considered personally identifiable because they might allow other parties to identify you as an individual. However, demographic data such as age, sex, zip code, and other such data are not as they only allow the indentification of groups. 

Credit card numbers are 100% encrypted. Not even TYP managers or programmers are capable of decrypting your credit card number. Only the credit card acceptance company is capable of reading the encrypted credit card number. As such TYP personnel are unable to provide our Members with the credit card numbers they use on the TYP websites (not even the last four digits) should they enquire. 

Your personal information will never be disclosed to any third-party company or mailing list without your consent except as provided herein. Track Your Plaque will share and limit the dissemination of information only to third-parties such as those associated with the fulfillment process of product orders or as required by law. 

_Health Information (HI):_ Certain features of this Site make use of Member Provided Health Information. This information is covered under strict HIPAA rules and is therefore held in the strictest confidence. Under no circumstances will your Health Information be disclosed to any third party without your express and informed consent. 

Members who wish to participate in Track Your Plaque affiliated medical research or clinical trials that require Health Information to be sent to third parties will be required to provide express consent to release their Health Information. Such information will be identified by a code known only to Track Your Plaque and will not contain any Personally Identifiable Information. 

ADDITIONAL PRIVACY INFORMATION

If, in the future, there are bonafied opportunites to use Member information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify Members via email. Members will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted and their personal information will not be used in this new manner. 

Should material changes in our privacy practices occur we will post a prominent notice on this Site and/or email Members who have opted to receive communications from us notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. It is recommended to check our Privacy Statement periodically for updates.
