		<h2 id="section_4">4. Security and Storage of Information</h2>
		<p>When I Work cares about the security of your information and uses commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technological safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information we collect and that we share with our service providers.

		<p>Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which When I Work or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities.
