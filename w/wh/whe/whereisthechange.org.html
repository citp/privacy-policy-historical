<article><strong>Privacy Policy&nbsp;</strong><br>
AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY (the “Organization” or “AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY”) recognizes that visitors to our respective Web sites are entitled to know how we collect, use, and maintain information we collect or may collect about them.&nbsp; This privacy policy explains what information we collect, how we use that information, with whom we will share this information, and related information.<strong>Information Collection</strong><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information&nbsp;</strong><br>
We gather certain broad information about Web site use, including the number of unique visitors, the frequency with which they visit, and the programs and services preferred.&nbsp; We look at the data in summary form, rather than on an individual basis.&nbsp; We gather this information so we can learn how many people visit our site, see which pages are the most and least viewed, identify which Web sites are referring visitors to our site, and related information.&nbsp; The data helps us determine the extent to which visitors use certain parts of our Web site.&nbsp; Thus, we use this information to help us in restructuring our site to better meet the needs of our constituency and to better serve our constituency as an effective organization.<br>
In connection with these activities we may use some of the below mentioned tools.<br>
<strong><br>
Cookies</strong><br>
We use a standard technology called a “cookie” to collect information about how the site is used.&nbsp; Cookies are small strings of text stored on your computer’s hard drive by a Web server.&nbsp; We use session cookies to identify your computer during a particular session, i.e., when you sign into the site or post a comment.&nbsp; If you create a user account or otherwise join our site, these cookies enable you to store your password for fast logon and other conveniences.&nbsp; We do not store personal or sensitive information in cookies.&nbsp; Cookies cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your e-mail address.&nbsp; Most Web browsers provide you the ability to accept or decline cookies, as well as to be warned each time a cookie is being sent.&nbsp; If you choose to decline cookies, however, you may not be able to take advantage of all aspects of our site.<br>
<strong><br>
IP Addresses</strong><br>
We collect and analyze traffic on our Web site by keeping track of the IP addresses of our visitors.&nbsp; An IP address is the unique numeric identifier assigned to each computer browser accessing the Internet.&nbsp; An IP address, by itself, cannot identify you personally.&nbsp; However, when combined with other information provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), your IP address can be used to identify the computer originating a message.<br>
<strong><br>

<strong><br>
Security</strong><br>
<strong>Information submitted via the Internet, including through a Web page or e-mail is subject to interception or incorrect routing, and the Internet is not a fully secure communications channel.&nbsp; Please consider this prior to submitting any information to us via this Web site.</strong><br>
Certain sections of this site may have heightened security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information you have provided.&nbsp; The security measures used on this site to protect any available online donation pages include, but are not limited to, industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, third party SSL certificate validation, firewalls, and internal policies to maintain the security of stored data.&nbsp; While we follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100 percent secure.&nbsp; Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br>
<strong><br>
Your Help Is Needed</strong><br>
Remember, breaches of security also can occur when users are not vigilant in protecting their own information.&nbsp; The next section of our privacy policy suggests some actions you can take to help control the security of your personal information</p>
<p>Although we do our best to protect your privacy on our site, we need your help.</p>
<p>You have control over your own privacy.&nbsp; Think carefully before providing any personal or financial information online.</p>
<p>Although this site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information you provide, no e-mail or Web transmission is completely secure against interception.&nbsp; If you are worried because your communication is very sensitive, do not send it electronically.</p>
<p>When you write to us or send us submissions, if you desire to remain anonymous, you should not tell us your name, the names of other users, or of your friends.&nbsp; To fully protect your privacy, you should try to exclude any information that you think may identify you or others.</p>
<p>Remember that we cannot protect your privacy once you leave our site, such as by hyperlink.&nbsp; So when you visit other Web sites, check each site’s privacy policy, and be careful about the information you submit or share.</p>
<p>You should be aware that in some areas of this site we utilize personalization measures designed to make your site experience more enjoyable (i.e., personalized links in e-mail that allow data fields to be pre-populated with certain personal information).&nbsp; We need your help to protect the information embedded in these links.&nbsp; You should always keep your e-mail account information secure and not allow others to access your e-mail account.</p>
<p>In addition, you should only forward our email messages or other Web site information (such as volunteer or job postings) to others through the buttons or links provided within the e-mail or Web site.&nbsp; When you use your e-mail system’s forwarding capabilities, others may be able to take actions in your name and/or access your personal information.<br>
You may be given the option to turn on a persistent cookie on your computer.&nbsp; Remember that once you have set a persistent cookie that is linked to your personal information, anyone can access your personal information by using your computer.</p>
<p>In addition to the records left on your computer by cookies, your browser and operating system contain other records of your Web browsing and other actions (e.g., browser history).&nbsp; As with cookies, you can find information about how to clear these history trails in your browser’s “Help” section or through other Web sites that provide detailed information for each browser and operating system.</p>
