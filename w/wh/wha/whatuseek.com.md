1. |  | What information does whatUseek collect and how is it used?  
   
---|---|---  
  |  | 

whatUseek collects and uses the following types of information: cookies, IP addresses, browser type, access times, URLs, registration and billing information, and tags for whether or not an email has been viewed.  The collection and use of each of these is described below:  
   


| a. |  | Cookies are used to assign identification to your computer and to track the effectiveness of marketing campaigns for whatUseek offerings.  Information stored in cookies includes reference numbers, which can be queried internally by whatUseek and correlated with other data stored locally on whatUseek servers.  Such reference numbers can track the effectiveness of a particular marketing campaign, manage sessions, personalize content for you, analyze traffic patterns and visitor behavior within whatUseek web sites for purposes of marketing and user friendliness, or perform other functions.  Another form of information stored in cookies is login information as part of the optional "Remember Me" function found throughout the whatUseek sites.  When the "Remember Me" function is turned on, your username and password is automatically inserted into the given login form.  You may turn off the cookies feature of your web browser within its preference settings, but in doing so, you will limit some of the features available to you in the whatUseek sites.  
   
---|---|---  
b. |  | Your IP addresses may also be tracked for purposes of security, diagnosing technical problems, managing sessions, personalize content for you, analyzing traffic patterns and visitor behavior within whatUseek web sites (as it applies to marketing and user friendliness), and/or identifying and performing functions relating to your specific geographic location.  
   
c. |  | Browser types, access times, and referring URLs (URLs from which a whatUseek page was linked) are recorded.  Except as stated otherwise in this privacy policy, whatUseek does not provide this information to any third parties, except in aggregate form.  
   
d. |  | In order to sign-up for services or make requests, such as for sales inquiries or proposals, we may ask you to submit personal information.  This information may include, for example, for name and email address.  You may always choose not to provide us with such information; however, this may limit our ability to provide you with a specific service or properly answer your inquiries.  
   
e. |  | If you register for a paid service on a whatUseek site, you may be required to submit billing information.  We make our best efforts to protect your billing information through encryption, although we cannot guarantee complete security.  In order to complete a transaction, payment information may be processed by a third-party, such as a merchant bank.  
   
f. |  | We may also collect information through the use of "pixel tags" included in email messages that we send you.  Pixel tags are small, invisible images that are included in HTML emails.  When an email with a pixel tag is viewed (and this pixel tag is accessed from our servers), we are able to record information relating to the viewing of this tag.  Such information would include, but is not limited to, the date and time at which the message was viewed, the email address, and the IP address of the user.
