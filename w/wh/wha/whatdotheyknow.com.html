      request to.  They only get to see an email address
    @whatdotheyknow.com which is specific to that request.  </p>
    <p>If you send a message to another user on the site, then it will reveal your
    email address to them. You will be told that this is going to happen.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt id="nasty_spam">Will you send nasty, brutish spam to my email address? <a href="#nasty_spam">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>Nope. After you sign up to WhatDoTheyKnow we will only send you emails
    relating to a request you made, an email alert that you have signed up for,
    or for other reasons that you specifically authorise. We will never give or
    sell your email addresses to anyone else, unless we are obliged to by law, or
    you ask us to.
    </dd>
    <dt id="public_request">Why will my name and my request appear publicly on the site? <a href="#public_request">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>
    <p>We publish your request on the Internet so that anybody can read it and
      make use of the information that you have found. We do not normally delete
      requests (<a href="#delete_requests">more details</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Your name is tangled up with your request, so has to be published as well.
      It is only fair, as we're going to publish the name of the civil servant who
      writes the response to your request.  Using your real name also helps people
      get in touch with you to assist you with your research or to campaign with you.
    </p>
    <p>By law, you must use your real name for the request to be a valid Freedom of
      Information request. See the next question for alternatives if you do not want
      to publish your full name.
    </p>
    </dd>
    <dt id="real_name">Can I make an FOI request using a pseudonym? <a href="#real_name">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>
    <p>Technically, you must use your real name for your request to be a valid Freedom of Information request in law. See this
      <a href="http://ico.org.uk/for_organisations/guidance_index/~/media/documents/library/Freedom_of_Information/Detailed_specialist_guides/MOTIVE_BLIND_V1.ashx">guidance from the Information Commissioner</a> (October 2007).
    </p>
    <p>However, the same guidance also says it is good practice for the public
      authority to still consider a request made using an obvious pseudonym.
      You should refer to this if a public authority refuses a request because you
    used a pseudonym.</p>
    <p>Be careful though, even if the authority follows this good practice, the
      pseudonym will probably make it impossible for you to complain to the
      Information Commissioner later about the handling of your request.
    </p>
    <p>There are several good alternatives to using a pseudonym.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a different form of your name. The guidance says
        that "Mr Arthur Thomas Roberts" can make a valid request as "Arthur Roberts",
        "A. T. Roberts", or "Mr Roberts", but <strong>not</strong> as "Arthur" or "A.T.R.".
      </li>
      <li>Women may use their maiden name.</li>
      <li>In most cases, you may use any name by which you are "widely known and/or
      is regularly used".</li>
      <li>Use the name of an organisation, the name of a company, the trading name of
      a company, or the trading name of a sole trader.</li>
      <li>Ask someone else to make the request on your behalf.</li>
      <li>You may, if you are really stuck, ask us to make the request on
        your behalf. Please <a href="/help/contact">contact us</a> with
        a good reason why you cannot make the request yourself and cannot
      ask a friend to. We don't have the resources to do this for everyone.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please do not try to impersonate someone else.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt id="anonymous">Why are there anonymous requests on the site? <a href="#anonymous">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>
    Some public authorities were using mySociety's <a href="https://github.com/mysociety/foi-register">FOI Register</a> software in order to use WhatDoTheyKnow as a disclosure log for all their FOI activity.   When people make requests to the authority their names will usually be withheld from publication just as they would in an authority disclosure log on an authority website.
    </dd>
    <dt id="full_address">They've asked for my postal address! <a href="#full_address">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>
    <p>If a public authority asks you for your full, physical address, reply to them saying
      that section 8.1.b of the FOI Act asks for an "address for correspondence",
      and that the email address you are using is sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ministry of Justice has guidance on this–
      <em>"As well as hard copy written correspondence, requests that are
      transmitted electronically (for example, in emails) are acceptable
      ... If a request is received by email and no postal address is given, the email
      address should be treated as the return address."
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>As if that isn't enough, the Information Commissioner's
      <a href="http://www.ico.org.uk/for_organisations/freedom_of_information/guide/receiving_a_request">Hints for Practitioners</a> say
      <em>"A request must ... include an address for correspondence. This need not be the person's residential or work address - it can be <strong>any address at which you can write to them</strong>, including a postal address or <strong>email address</strong>;"</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Paragraph 107 of the <a href="http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/library/Freedom_of_Information/Research_and_reports/recognising-a-request-made-under-the-foia.pdf" title="Recognising a request made under the FOIA">Information Commissioner's Guidance on recognising a request</a> under the Freedom of Information Act now contains a section specifically on <a href="/">WhatDoTheyKnow</a> which states:
    </p><blockquote>With respect to the address for correspondence, we consider the <code>@whatdotheyknow.com</code> email address provided to authorities when requests are made through the site to be a valid contact address for the purposes of Section 8(1)(b).</blockquote><p></p>
    </dd>
    <dt id="postal_answer">No no, they need a postal address to send a paper response! <a href="#postal_answer">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>
    <p>If an authority only has a paper copy of the information that you want,
      they may ask you for a postal address. To start with, try persuading them
      to scan in the documents for you. You can even <a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/car_parking_charges_policy_and_a#outgoing-532">offer to gift them a scanner</a>, which in that particular case
    embarrassed the authority into finding one they had already.</p>
    <p>If that doesn't work, and you want to provide your postal address privately
      in order to receive the documents, mark your request as "They are going to reply by post", and it will
    give you an email address to use for that purpose.</p>

    <p><strong>Our use of cookies and external services: what you should know, and how to opt out if you want to.</strong></p>
    <p>Summary: We care a lot about our users’ privacy. We provide details below, and we try our hardest to look after the private data that we hold. Like many other websites, we sometimes use cookies and Google Analytics to help us make our websites better. These tools are very common and used by many other sites, but they do have privacy implications, and as a charity concerned with socially positive uses of the internet, we think it’s important to explain them in full. If you don’t want to share your browsing activities on mySociety’s sites with other companies, you can adjust your usage or install opt-out browser plugins.</p>
    <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
    <p>To make our service easier or more useful, we sometimes place small data files on your computer or mobile phone, known as cookies; many websites do this. We use this information to, for example, remember you have logged in so you don't need to do that on every page, or to measure how people use the website so we can improve it and make sure it works properly. Below, we list the cookies and services that this site can use.</p>

    <p><strong>Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)</strong></p>
    <p>
      We use Google Analytics to collect information about how people use this site. We do this to make sure it’s meeting its users’ needs and to understand how we could do it better. Google Analytics stores information such as what pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here, what you click on, and information about your web browser. IP addresses are masked (only a portion is stored) and personal information is only reported in aggregate. We do not allow Google to use or share our analytics data for any purpose besides providing us with analytics information, and we recommend that any user of Google Analytics does the same.
    </p>
    <p>If you’re unhappy with data about your visit to be used in this way, you can install the <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">official browser plugin for blocking Google Analytics</a>.
    </p><p>The cookies set by Google Analytics are as follows:
      </p><table>
        <tbody><tr><th scope="col">Name</th><th scope="col">Typical Content</th><th scope="col">Expires</th></tr>
        <tr><td>__utma</td><td>Unique anonymous visitor ID</td><td>2 years</td></tr>
        <tr><td>__utmb</td><td>Unique anonymous session ID</td><td>30 minutes</td></tr>
        <tr><td>__utmz</td><td>Information on how the site was reached (e.g. direct or via a link/search/advertisement)</td><td>6 months</td></tr>
        <tr><td>__utmx</td><td>Which variation of a page you are seeing if we are testing different versions to see which is best</td><td>2 years</td></tr>

      <p><strong>Measuring website performance (New Relic)</strong></p>
      WhatDoTheyKnow uses New Relic to collect data on the performance of the  site - how quickly it sends pages and how much memory and processing power it takes on the computers that run it. We do this to ensure that the site runs quickly and efficiently. New Relic stores information on:
      <ul>
        <li>
          What pages are visited on the site, and how long they take to load.
        </li>
        <li>
          The structure, not the content, of database queries made in order to run the site and how long they take to run.
        </li>
        <li>
          Memory and CPU usage on the servers that run the site.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sample data about database queries, individual requests for pages is stored by New Relic for 7 days, aggregate data is stored for a maximum of 90 days.</p>

      <p>In addition to the information you give us about yourself in order to use the site (e.g. your name
        and email address), we collect and log some additional information in order to analyse and fix problems
        with the site. Our webserver logs maintain a history of page requests. This includes information about
        requests, including the client IP address, data submitted (which might include your email address when
        you log on to the site), request date and time, page requested, browser version and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer">referrer</a>. We routinely keep this information

        Information requests. Even though you may not find the response to
        a request useful any more, it may be of interest to others. For this
        reason, we will not delete requests.
      </p>
      <p>Under exceptional circumstances we may remove or change your name
        on the website, <a href="#takedown">see the next question</a>.
        Similarly, we may also remove other personal information.
      </p>
      <p>If you're worried about this before you make your request,
        see the section on <a href="#real_name">pseudonyms</a>.

      <p>If you see any personal information about you on the site which you'd like
        us to remove or hide, then please <a href="/help/contact">let us know</a>.
        Specify exactly what information you believe to be problematic and why, and
      where it appears on the site.</p>
      <p>If it is sensitive personal information that has been accidentally
        posted, then we will usually remove it. Normally we will only consider
        requests to remove personal information which come from the individual
        concerned, but for sensitive information we would appreciate anyone
      pointing out anything they see.</p>
      <p>You have the right under <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/section/10">section 10 of the
      Data Protection Act</a> to request that we remove your personal information on
      the grounds that it is causing you substantial and unwarranted damage or
      distress. We will consider any such notice, which does not need to explicitly
      mention the Act, and balance it against any public interest in publishing the
      material. There is some guidance on these notices <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/principle-6-rights/damage-or-distress/">on the ICO’s website</a>.</p>

      <p>Whilst we have a general presumption that more openness is better, we will
        consider requests to remove the names of public servants when it seems unlikely
      that the public interest will be harmed by doing so.</p>
      <p>This means that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you are a decision maker of any seniority, or if you are responding to
          an FOI request, we will not normally remove your details from documents and
          emails sent by a public body. Accountability of decision-making is at the heart
        of good government.</li>
        <li>If you hold a junior, non-decision making post we will consider requests to
          remove your details. Removing these details is difficult for our volunteers to
          do, so please let us know why this really matters to you. If we agree to remove
          your details we will take reasonable steps to do so but in some cases may not
        be able to for technical reasons.</li>
      </ul>
