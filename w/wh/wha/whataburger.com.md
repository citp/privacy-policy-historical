 INFORMATION USE, SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

Employees and contractors of Whataburger who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and the high standards of this organization.  Whataburger may use information about you for purposes described in this Privacy Policy or disclosed to you on our Web Site or with our services. For example, we may use information about you to: (1) process and manage your purchase and use of Whataburger products and services, including your accounts and program participation; (2) respond to your customer service inquiries, post your comments or statements on any blog or other online forum maintained on our Web Site, or take other actions in response to your inquiries or other Web Site activities; (3) communicate with you about or fulfill your orders or purchases, your services, accounts and program participation, a contest or sweepstakes you have entered, your requests for information, and about our brands, products, events or other promotional purposes, including co-branded offers and partner offers; and (4) operate, maintain, manage, fulfill and improve our service offerings and to provide services such as technical support.  

If you request information about employment opportunities with Whataburger, or if you complete an application for employment with Whataburger, we collect the personally identifiable information that you provide in connection with such request or application. If you apply for employment with Whataburger, we may also collect additional personally identifiable information about you from third parties to verify, update or supplement the information you provide us in the application process.  Applicable law may require that you authorize a third party to disclose your personally identifiable information with us before such third party can provide it to us. Failure to authorize such third party to provide us the necessary information, or failure to provide any other information requested in the employment application may negatively impact our consideration of your employment application. By applying for employment with Whataburger, you expressly consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of your personally identifiable information in the manner and for the purposes provided in this Privacy Policy. 

Whataburger will not sell your personally identifiable information to anyone at any time without your prior permission.  We will transfer or otherwise disclose the information we collect from Web Site visitors to employees and independent contractors of Whataburger and its service providers if the disclosure will enable that party to perform a business, professional, or technical support function for Whataburger, or if required to do so by law. We will also transfer or otherwise disclose personal information in response to judicial process, to comply with legal requirements, and, as permitted under provisions of law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on a matter related to public safety. We may also use your personal information as permitted by law to protect our rights or property, the Web Site, or its users.

We routinely use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our Web Site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience, as well as for general system administration. We also may use this information to analyze site usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or services to you or other users like you. 

 USE OF E-MAIL ADDRESSES

Whataburger may periodically send informational or promotional e-mail messages. Sometimes these are referred to as newsletters. You will not receive such e-mail messages unless, at the time you provide us with your e-mail address, you indicate that you wish to receive such promotional e-mails. If you are asked for your e-mail address and are not given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving additional information, then the e-mail address is to be used only for the specific service you request. If you subscribe to receive promotional e-mails from Whataburger and wish to stop receiving such e-mails, you may request discontinuation of e-mail messages by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link on the e-mail you received or by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the main page of the Whataburger.com web site.
