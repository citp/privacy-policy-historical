## WhatIfSports Statement of Privacy

The Internet is an amazing tool. It has the power to change the way we live, and we're starting to see that potential today. With only a few mouse-clicks, you can follow the news, look up facts, buy goods and services, and communicate with others from around the world--even people you might never have met. It's important to WhatIfSports.com to help its customers retain their privacy when they take advantage of all the Internet has to offer.

### Privacy Principles

Because your privacy is important to us, WhatIfSports.com will operate by the following six principles. Users should additionally consult the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section accompanying this Privacy Statement for more information regarding these principles.

#### Principle 1.

WhatIfSports.com will explicitly ask when they need information that personally identifies you or allows them to contact you ("Personal Information"). Generally this information is requested when registering for a site, when requesting a particular service, or when entering a sweepstakes or contest. When possible, WhatIfSports.com will provide you with the means to make sure that your Personal Information is correct and current.

#### Principle 2.

WhatIfSports.com and their necessary service partners use your Personal Information to operate the sites and services and to inform you of new features, services, and products from WhatIfSports.com and its affiliates. WhatIfSports.com may also carefully select other companies to send you information about their products or services which are related to the site's service but are not necessary to its operation (a "Secondary Use").

#### Principle 3.

If WhatIfSports.com intends to use Personal Information for a Secondary Use, WhatIfSports.com will provide you with instructions on how to decline this service. You may also stop the delivery of informational or promotional mail from WhatIfSports.com sites by following the instructions on the mail.

#### Principle 4.

WhatIfSports.com will not use Personal Information for a Secondary Use without obtaining the consent of a parent or guardian when dealing with children. When possible, WhatIfSports.com will provide e-mail notice to parents that children have provided Personal Information to the site.

#### Principle 5.

WhatIfSports.com may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on WhatIfSports.com; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of WhatIfSports.com, the site or the users of WhatIfSports.com, and (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of WhatIfSports.com.

#### Principle 6.

If at any time you believe that WhatIfSports.com has not adhered to these principles, please notify WhatIfSports.com by e-mail at [webmaster@whatifsports.com](mailto:webmaster@whatifsports.com?subject=Privacy%20Statement) and we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and correct the problem.

WhatIfSports.com is committed to maintaining its position as a premier site on the Internet. As our site continues to develop, we may add new services and features to our website. In the event that these additions affect our Privacy Statement, this document will be updated appropriately.

#### What about "Cookies"?

"Cookies" are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. "Cookies" can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site. The use of "Cookies" is an industry standard, and many major Web sites use them to provide useful features for their customers. "Cookies" in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. Most browsers are initially set to accept "Cookies". If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse "Cookies". However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a Web site if you do so. For example, the subscription services of WhatIfSports.com may only be accessed if you accept "Cookies".

#### How do WhatIfSports.com sites use Personal Information?

Usually, WhatIfSports.com sites and their necessary service partners use your Personal Information to operate the site and to deliver their services. WhatIfSports.com may also use your Personal Information to inform you of other products or services available from WhatIfSports.com and its affiliates. WhatIfSports.com may also use Personal Information to allow other companies to contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you (Secondary Uses).

#### Does that mean WhatIfSports.com sites sell my Personal Information to other companies?

No, WhatIfSports.com does not sell customer lists. However, WhatIfSports.com may partner with businesses to provide special services to our customers. This type of use of Personal Information is called a "Secondary Use" because it is not necessary to the operation of the business or site. For example, a site may offer discount coupons for services or related products. In many cases these discounts would be an added benefit to our customers.

#### What about the Privacy of children?

Safeguarding the Personal Information of children is extremely important.

#### Do WhatIfSports.com sites collect other forms of information about its users?

In addition to the use of Personal Information to operate WhatIfSports.com, WhatIfSports.com may also gather anonymous information, which may be used by WhatIfSports.com or shared with third parties. This is information which does not personally identify you, but which may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. For example, WhatIfSports.com might tell its advertisers how many users visited a particular advertisement, and for how long, so they can measure whether the advertisement was effective. This information is also used to generate advertising rates.
