### 1\. INTRODUCTION

Whatifsports.com, Inc. ("Whatifsports") and Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC ("FSIM" collectively with Whatifsports "Fox" "we" or "us") operates the website [http://www.whatifsports.com](http://www.whatifsports.com/) ("Whatifsports.com" or "Site"), which is an entertainment website including community features and fantasy games. The services Fox offers include any Fox-branded URL, online community features, Premium Subscriptions, which allows users to participate in certain fantasy games, public forums, and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by Fox in connection with Fox's business, including when accessed via the Internet, mobile or other device (collectively, the "Fox Services"). Fox is part of the United States based operations of News Corporation.

As set forth in our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20121004014510id_/http%3A//www.whatifsports.com/locker/terms.shtm), the Site is a general audience website, is not targeted to children, and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.

This Privacy Policy describes Fox's collection, use and sharing of personal information about users (e.g., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address) where that personal information is not otherwise publicly available on the Site. This Privacy Policy also describes generally Fox's practices for handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., user interests, demographics, or Site usage) to the extent such non-personally identifiable information is associated with a particular user or user account. This Privacy Policy applies to all "users," including visitors (users who use some of the Fox Services without being registered with Fox), "Members" (users who have registered with Fox) and "Subscribers" (Members who have purchased a Premium Subscription or registered for a newsletter). All personal information collected on the Site is jointly owned by Fox and Microsoft Online, Inc. ("MSN").

We may also collect user submitted information in an offline or manual format, such as a postcard. In such circumstances, you will be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Privacy Policy and other relevant information.

_Site Collected Information_

**Site Activity Information**. When users visit the Site, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Site, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Fox Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it. We also may use cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe flash technology including cookies), which are small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier. Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that website. We may use these technologies to collect and store information about your usage of the Site, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen.

Third parties that support the Site by serving advertisements or providing Fox Services, such as allowing users to share content, view premium content, participate in Fantasy Games or post to the forums or tracking aggregate Site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information. Fox does not control these third party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. For more information about third party ad networks that use these technologies, see [www.aboutads.info/consumers](http://www.aboutads.info/consumers).

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., [http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies)](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies). Users can manage the use of Flash technologies with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website, see [http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html.](http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html) Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features or personalization available through Fox Services.

**Third Parties**. To improve the quality of the Fox Services, we may supplement the information we collect with information that is collected or provided by third parties.

### 3\. NOTICE & CHOICE

**Means of Notice and Choice.** This Privacy Policy is the primary means by which Fox provides you with notice and choice regarding its collection and use of your personal information. Fox will not use your personal information in a manner different from what is described in this Privacy Policy without your permission.

**Privacy Policy Changes**. Fox may modify this Privacy Policy as necessary. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that expand our rights to use your personal information, we will notify you to seek your consent either through an email or a prominent posting on the Site.

**Location of Data Storage**. Fox Services are hosted in the United States. If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information you provide transferred to, stored and processed in the United States. United States data protection and other relevant laws and regulations may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction. As a result, please read this Privacy Policy with care.

**Linked Websites**. The Fox Services may also be linked to websites operated by Fox affiliates (i.e., that are part of the News Corporation: ["Affiliated Companies"](http://www.newscorp.com/)) or third parties. Fox is not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties, and once you leave the Fox Services via a link, or click an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third-party site. Additionally, although all Affiliated Companies adhere to the News Corporation corporate [Privacy Principles](http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html), users who visit an Affiliated Company website should still refer to the Affiliated Companies' separate privacy policy, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those websites that do not display or link to this Privacy Policy or have its own privacy statements.

**Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Third Party**. You acknowledge and agree that this Privacy Policy will not apply to any Personal Financial Information that you provide to any independent third party company on the Site and that all payment obligations related to such purchase shall be governed solely by the applicable independent third party company’s privacy policy. You further acknowledge and agree that Fox will have no liability for or control over such independent third party company’s use or protection of your Personal Financial Information. You should check the privacy policy of the independent third party company‘s website to determine how it will handle any Personal Financial Information it collects from you and/or processes. You acknowledge and agree that in the event that such independent third party company experiences a data breach that compromises or otherwise affects your Personal Financial Information, Fox shall in no way be responsible or liable to you for such breach. You should contact the applicable independent third party company regarding any such data breach.
