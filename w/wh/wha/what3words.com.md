### **2\. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING**

In certain jurisdictions, such as those located within the European Union, we are required to establish legal bases to process your personal data. We have identified our legal basis for processing in respect of each of the processing activities set out below:

#### **(A) Responding to correspondence instigated by you**

Where you contact us for any reason, we will process any personal data provided by you for the purposes set out under Section 1(A) above. On balance, we consider that we have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data for those limited purposes, and that it is necessary to do so.

#### **  (B) ** **Administering your what3words account**

When you create an account with us you sign up to our [Terms and Conditions](https://what3words.com/terms/).

#### **  (C) ** **Effectively manage our business and improve our services**
