				<h2>Whats Your Price: Online Dating</h2>
				<p>WhatsYourPrice.com is a patent pending online dating site that works. On other dating personals or matchmaking sites, attractive singles are overwhelmed with messages while singles with high standards are often rejected without any responses. On WhatsYourPrice.com, just name a price, and if your offer is right, you'll get a YES and you're off on a first date.  We'll get you that first date, but what happens after the first date is entirely up to you...
