## PURPOSE OF THIS PRIVACY NOTICE

This privacy notice aims to give you information on how WHSmith collects and processes your personal data through your use of this website, including any data you may provide through this website when you shop with us.

WH Smith High Street Limited is the data controller and is responsible for your personal data (collectively referred to as "WHSmith", "we", "us" or "our" in this privacy notice).

It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.

  * Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
  * Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.



Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in relation to sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email or text message. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us at [support@whsmith.co.uk](mailto:support@whsmith.co.uk) or by 'opting out' of marketing communications in any e-mail sent to you.

  * **Request any corrections** to the personal data that we hold about you;
  * **Request erasure** of your personal data;
  * **Object to processing** of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground;

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).

## THE DATA WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU 

Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).

When you complete an online form, register or shop with us online, we may collect, use and store different kinds of personal data about you such as your name, gender, date of birth, billing/delivery address, e-mail address and telephone number. We may also collect and retain information about your interactions with us either in store, online or through our contact centres so that we can process your transactions and deal with any future queries.

We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. **Aggregated Data** may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.

We do not collect any **Special Categories of Personal Data** about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.

## CONSENT

In certain situations, we can collect and process your data with your consent. 

In limited situations, we may approach you for your written consent to allow us to process certain particularly sensitive data. If we do so, we will provide you with full details of the information that we would like and the reason we need it, so that you can carefully consider whether you wish to consent. You should be aware that it is not a condition of your contract with us that you agree to any request for consent from us.

When collecting your personal data, we'll always make clear to you which data is necessary in connection with a particular contractual or legal requirement. 

We may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent (for example, in relation to fraud management or to assist with investigations by the police or other regulatory bodies) in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

## OPTING OUT

You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by contacting us at [support@whsmith.co.uk](mailto:support@whsmith.co.uk) or by 'opting out' of marketing communications in any e-mail sent to you.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data by making a 'Request for Erasure'. In order to make such a request, please write to us at [support@whsmith.co.uk](mailto:support@whsmith.co.uk). Following your request, your personal data shall be removed from our database without undue delay in accordance with statutory requirements. Our DPO shall thereafter take reasonable steps to inform any third parties who may be processing any personal data they hold about you that you have requested the erasure of any links to, or copy or replication of, your personal data.

## THIRD-PARTY LINKS 

Clicking on links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications contained within this website, or enabling those connections, may allow third parties to collect or share data about you.

## DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA: 

We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out above (in 'Purposes for which we will use your Personal Data'):

  * Other WHSmith group entities, details of which can be found in our [ Annual Reports;](http://www.whsmithplc.co.uk/investors/company_reports/annual_reports)
  * Third party suppliers in order to fulfil orders placed by you; or

We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.

## INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS 

We do not transfer your personal data outside the European Economic Area ( **EEA** ).

## DATA SECURITY 

We have appropriate security measures in place to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have procedures in place to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

## HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY PERSONAL DATA FOR? 

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

## IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE YOUR PERSONAL DATA 

Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with goods or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.

## DATA PROTECTION OFFICER 

We have appointed a Data Protection Officer ("DPO") who is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this privacy notice. If you have any questions about this privacy notice, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact Data Protection Officer, WHSmith, Greenbridge Road, Swindon SN3 3LD or e-mail [support@whsmith.co.uk](mailto:support@whsmith.co.uk). 

## CONTACTING THE REGULATOR

If you feel that your data has not been handled correctly, or you wish to make a complaint, you have the right to contact the Information Commissioner's Office ("ICO"), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues, at any time. You can contact them by telephone (0303 123 1113) or via their website (<http://www.ico.org.uk/concerns>). We would, however, be grateful for the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance.
