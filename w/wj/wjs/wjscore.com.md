This Privacy Policy describes HMH’s collection, use, and sharing of information associated with
the HMH online assessment platform (“"the Product”) made available through this website (the
“website” or “site”). “You” and “Your” refer to anyone using the Product via our site. Use of the
Product entails Your submission of Submitted Data (as that term is defined below) as well as our
passive collection of technical and other information in connection with Your use of the Product

access the Product, whether via personal computers, mobile devices, or otherwise.
To the extent particular information qualifies as Protected Health Information (PHI) under the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) and HIPAA affords greater
privacy protections than those set forth in this Privacy Policy, HMH will comply with the
relevant HIPAA requirements regarding privacy for that particular information.

well as customer satisfaction surveys and requests for Feedback about our Product and site. You
may opt out from receiving certain communications by following the instructions provided at the
bottom of the communication. Please understand that You will not be able to opt out of formal
notices concerning the operation of our site, and legal and other related notices concerning Your

used, and to improve the functionality of our Products and services.
Our Use of De-Identified Information. HMH will only use De-Identified Information for
lawful purposes, including but not limited to, quality assurance, research, and/or test

We do not sell, rent, or license Your Personal Information to anyone. We do share Personal
Information with other companies in the following situations:
Sharing Your Information with Subcontractors. We may share information with
subcontractors that act as our agent and that provide us with services related to the provision or
operation of the Product. These services may include, among other things, helping us to provide
products or services that You request, creating or maintaining our databases, processing orders

Information is required either contractually or by law to keep Your Personal Information
confidential and not to disclose or repurpose the information, and to use such information only as
required for the services to be performed.

our users. If we provide links to third-party websites and You select a link to a third-party site,
please note that You are subject to the privacy and security policies of the third party who

party has agreed to safeguard Your Submitted Data with protections that in all material respects
are the same as or more protective than those set out in this Privacy Policy.
