|  |  WKBW has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site: www.WKBW.com.

**Use of IP Addresses**  
WKBW's web site logs IP addresses for systems administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to track a user's session, providing WKBW with an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.

**Use of "cookies"**  
WKBW uses a feature of your browser to set a "cookie" on your computer. This allows us to measure and report aggregate information to advertisers such as the number of people who see their ad (reach) and the number of times people see their ad (frequency).

Cookies by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. WKBW will only store information provided voluntarily, but this information is not personally identifiable. If for some reason you would rather not take advantage of the benefits made possible with cookies, most browsers allow you to reject cookies or to choose which cookies to accept.

**Use of User Information**  
It is WKBW's policy to allow our users to provide as much or as little personal information to us as they feel comfortable doing. As a customer of WKBW you:

  1. Control what personally identifiable information is collected  

  2. Control what WKBW can do with the information  

  3. Have a guarantee of privacy  


We hope that, like many of our users, you will want to provide information about yourself to WKBW because it will make our web site more valuable to you. If you are comfortable providing us with information about yourself, enhanced services are available to you that are impossible for us to offer to anonymous users. Examples of such enhanced services would be free email or our newsletter and news bulletin service.

WKBW gathers information about our users that allow us to offer compelling and easily accessible online content in a manner that provides personal privacy protection as well. The type of information we collect is solely informational (like name, address) and demographic (like age, gender). 

  * Occasionally we ask you to provide us information such as your name, email address or what your interests and hobbies are. You never have to answer these questions, although this may limit what services we can offer you. For instance, we will not be able to contact you if you win one of our contests if we do not have an email or home address.
  * Demographic information (like zip code, age) and profile data collected is only shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. Personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties.
  * We use contact data from our contests to send users promotional material only if they have agreed to be contacted at a future date.
  * Our free email service is provided by a separate vendor, BigMailBox.com, which has its own privacy policy. Click here to read it: <http://www.bigmailbox.com/privacy.html>

This site contains links to other sites. WKBW is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

**Public Forums**  
This site makes chat rooms and message boards available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

**Security**  
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. 

**Third Party Relationships**  
WKBW has third party content relationships with the following companies: Popmail.com provides our E News Notifier service. They are collecting data on our behalf and adhere to our privacy policy.
