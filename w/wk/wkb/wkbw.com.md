Use of IP Addresses

**

WKBW’s web site logs IP addresses for systems administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to track a user’s session, providing WKBW with an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.

**

Use of "cookies"

**

WKBW uses a feature of your browser to set a "cookie" on your computer. This allows us to measure and report aggregate information to advertisers such as the number of people who see their ad (reach) and the number of times people see their ad (frequency).

Cookies by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. WKBW will only store information provided voluntarily, but this information is not personally identifiable. If for some reason you would rather not take advantage of the benefits made possible with cookies, most browsers allow you to reject cookies or to choose which cookies to accept.

You never have to answer these questions, although this may limit what services we can offer you. For instance, we will not be able to contact you if you win one of our contests if we do not have an email or home address.


  * Information regarding your interests will be asked when signing-up for our E-mail News Notification service so that we know when to send you a topical e-mail. This service is purely voluntary and no information gathered based on preferences is shared with third parties.


  * Demographic information (like zip code, age) and profile data collected is only shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. Personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties.
