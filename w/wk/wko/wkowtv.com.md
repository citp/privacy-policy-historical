Copyright © 2006 WKOW-TV. All rights reserved. 

WKOW-TV owns and operates wkowtv.com. WKOW-TV may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. This policy applies only to information collected by wkowtv.com and does not impact information collected or used by WKOW-TV, wkowtv.com or their affiliates through other means. 

_**  
Information collected from users**_  
How we collect and retain information depends on the portion of the site you are accessing, the activities you elect to participate in and the services provided. You can visit many pages on our site without providing any information. Other pages may request you to provide information, such as when you register for access to portions of our site, request certain features, sign up for a newspaper subscription or make a purchase. You may also provide information when you participate in message boards, chat rooms and other interactive areas of our site. 

Like many websites, wkowtv.com also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. We may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use "cookie" technology. As technology progresses, we may also gather information through other means. In some cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but doing so may limit your ability to access certain portions of the site or may require you to re-enter your user name and password.

What We Do With the Information We Collect**_  
We will use your information only as permitted by law. Aggregated Information (information that does not identify you personally) may be used in many ways. Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners, but cannot be used to contact you individually. 

We also collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. For example, we may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on wkowtv.com to communicate with you regarding our Terms of Website Use, products and services offered by wkowtv.com, WKOW-TV and other affiliates and partners, administration of contests, processing e-commerce transactions and other topics we think you might find interesting. We reserve the right to share this information with other WKOW-TV business units and affiliates. This policy does not apply to any affiliate's use of such information. 

Personally Identifiable Information collected by wkowtv.com may also be used for other purposes including but not limited to site administration and troubleshooting. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site may access such information. 

We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary to give such information to law enforcement authorities. We may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases. 

_**  
Your Choice to Opt Out**_  
The news and content on wkowtv.com is supported by advertising revenue and a controlled program of e-mail marketing is an important element of our online publishing business. We sometimes permit our advertising and promotional partners to e-mail you about services, features, products, special offers and unique content we believe might interest you. If you prefer not to receive e-mail communications sent directly from our advertisers or promotional partners, you will be given an opportunity to decline before you provide us information we might use for this purpose. If you decline at the time you provide us such information, we will not share the Personally Identifiable Information you provide with non-Affiliated advertisers for such purposes, though we may on occasion send you information on their behalf.
