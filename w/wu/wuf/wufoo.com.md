Wufoo is an online form builder that strives to provide the easiest way for you to collect information over the internet. Wufoo is used by people who are interested in creating forms to collect information or perform a variety of other tasks (" **Form Creators** "), and by people who fill out these forms (" **Form Respondents** "). Wufoo is a service provided by SurveyMonkey Inc.'s subsidiaries and affiliates. 

This privacy statement describes privacy practices which are specific to Wufoo.com ("Wufoo") and should be read in conjunction with [SurveyMonkey's main Privacy Policy](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/policy/privacy-policy/) , which also applies to Wufoo to the extent that it is applicable and does not conflict with this privacy statement. This privacy statement describes how Wufoo collects, uses, shares and secures the personal information you provide. It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information. In the event of any conflict between this Wufoo Privacy Statement and SurveyMonkey's main Privacy Policy, this Wufoo Privacy Statement shall prevail only with respect to the terms that are specific to Wufoo, and SurveyMonkey's main Privacy Policy shall otherwise govern.

This privacy statement is split into two sections: one for **Form Creators** , and one for **Form Respondents**. 

### privacy for form creators

**1\. What information does SurveyMonkey collect?**

  * **Registration information.** You need a Wufoo account before you can create forms on Wufoo. When you register for an account, we collect your username, email address and password. We also collect your name if you supply it in the account management section. Some Wufoo account plans permit you to create accounts for other Form Creators under your own account. When you create accounts for these additional Form Creators, we collect their name and email address. 
  * **Billing Information.** We collect your credit card number and billing address when you decide to upgrade your account. 
  * **Form data.** We store your form data (form content and responses) for you. 



**2\. How does SurveyMonkey use the information we collect?**

We use the information we collect to provide you with our services. This in accordance with [SurveyMonkey's main Privacy Policy](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/policy/privacy-policy/) for survey creators (except that references to survey data should be read as references to form data in the context of Wufoo). We would like to emphasize that we will not use your form data to compete with you, market to your clients, or contact them for any other means of profit. We will not sell your form data. 

**3\. With whom do we share or disclose your information?**

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.  We disclose the information we collect in accordance with [SurveyMonkey's main Privacy Policy](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/policy/privacy-policy/) for survey creators (except that references to survey data should be read as references to form data in the context of Wufoo). 

**4\. What are your rights to your information?**

You can:

  * **Update your account details.** You can update your registration and other account information on your account management page. Information is updated immediately. 
  * **Opt-out Preferences.** When you register for an account, we will use your name and email address to send periodic emails to you of both promotional and transactional in nature. Out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving promotional emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or you can contact us at [insert contact info here]. We will also send you service related email announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. You do not have an option to opt out of these emails, which are not promotional in nature. 
  * **Download/backup your form data.** We provide you with the ability to export, share and publish your form data in a variety of formats. This allows you to create your own backups or work with your data offline. [See here for data exporting instructions](http://www.wufoo.com/docs/export/). 
  * **Delete your form data.** You can delete your form data (including parts of forms, entire forms and responses to forms) through your account's user interface. [See here for how to delete form entries](http://www.wufoo.com/docs/delete-entries/). 
  * **Cancel your Wufoo account.** You can cancel your Wufoo account at any time through your account management page. Any cancellation of your Wufoo account will result in the deletion of your account and all form data stored in it. This data cannot be recovered once your account is cancelled. Please be aware that SurveyMonkey may for a time retain residual information in our backup and/or archival copies of our database which takes up to about 12 months to disappear. 
  * **EU Users.**   Some account holders and other individuals (including those whose information we receive under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor) have certain legal rights to obtain information of whether we hold personal information about them, to access personal information we hold about them, and to obtain its correction, update, amendment or deletion in appropriate circumstances.  For some information, these rights may be exercised through your account management page, and in all cases, requests to exercise these rights may be directed to our [customer support team](http://help.wufoo.com/contact). These rights are subject to some exceptions, such as where giving you access would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other individuals. We will respond to your request to exercise these rights within a reasonable time and, where required by law or where we deem it otherwise appropriate and practicable to do so, we will honor your request. 



**5\. Security, cookies and other important information**

  * **Security.** Each Form Creator is assigned a unique username and password which is required to access their Wufoo account. It is each Form Creator's responsibility to protect the security of his or her login information. Regardless of the security protections and precautions we undertake, there is always a risk that your personal data may be viewed and used by unauthorized third parties as a result of collecting and transmitting your data over the internet. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, please contact [customer support](http://help.wufoo.com/contact) . 
  * **Cookies/ Tracking Technologies.** Wufoo and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users' movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service. To manage Flash cookies, please click here: <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html>. See SurveyMonkey's main Privacy Policy for general information about cookies. 
  * **Log files.** As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site.
  * **Behavioral Targeting.** We may ask advertising networks and exchanges to display ads promoting our services on other websites. We may ask them to deliver those ads based on the presence of a cookie, but in doing so will not share any other personal information with the advertiser. Our advertising network partners may use cookies and page tags or web beacons to collect certain non-personal information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you with targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you do not wish to have this information used for the purpose of serving you such targeted ads, you may opt-out at http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/ or, if you're located in the European Union, at [http://www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/). You will continue to receive generic ads. 
  * **Changes to this privacy statement.** This privacy statement may be changed in the same manner as changes that are made to SurveyMonkey's main Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this website prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
  * **Online tracking.** We currently do not process or comply with any web browser's "do not track" signal or other similar mechanism that indicates a request to disable online tracking of individual users who visit the Wufoo website or use the Wufoo services. 



### privacy for form respondents

**1\. What information does SurveyMonkey collect?**

  * **Responses to forms.** We collect and store the responses that you submit to forms. Form Creators are responsible for this data and manage it. A form may ask you to provide personal information or data. If you have any questions about a form you are completing, please contact the Form Creator who created the form directly as SurveyMonkey is not responsible for the content of that form. The creator of the form is usually the same person that invited you to complete the form and sometimes they have their own privacy policy. SurveyMonkey is not liable for any actions or inactions a Form Creator takes with respect to any data or information that they may collect from a Form Respondent. 



**2\. How does SurveyMonkey use the information we collect?**

We disclose the information we collect in accordance with [ SurveyMonkey's main Privacy Policy](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/policy/privacy-policy/) for survey respondents (except that references to surveys and survey data should be read as references to forms and form data in the context of Wufoo). 

**3\. With whom do we share or disclose your information?**

We disclose the information we collect in accordance with [SurveyMonkey's main Privacy Policy](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/policy/privacy-policy/) for survey respondents (except that references to surveys and survey data should be read as references to forms and form data in the context of Wufoo).

**4\. What are your rights to your information?**

  * **Contact the relevant Form Creator to access your responses.** Because we collect form responses on behalf of Form Creators and have no direct relation with form respondents, you will need to contact the Form Creator (the data controller) if you have any questions about the form, or if you no longer like to be contacted by them, or if you want to access, update, or delete anything in your responses. If requested to remove data we will respond within a reasonable timeframe. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Clients. 
  * We will retain your personal information (including information we process on behalf of the Form Creators) for as long as needed to provide services to our Form Creators. Wufoo will retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 
  * We provide Form Creators with tools to maintain the responses they collect through their forms. SurveyMonkey cannot provide you with this access since form responses are the Form Creator's private information.

Want to know why Wufoo is the best web form builder? When you design a web form with Wufoo, it automatically builds the database, backend, and scripts needed to make collecting and understanding your data easy, fast, and fun. Because we host everything, all you need is a browser, an Internet connection, and a few minutes to build a web form and start using it right away. At Wufoo, we believe web forms are the starting point for building anything useful on the web. Basically, they’re the most efficient mechanisms for collecting data from people. The problem is sometimes using a web form builder isn’t very efficient. The process of building a web form and all the database structures and scripts necessary to make it work (not to mention useful) is a really tedious process that makes what should be a simple task (collecting and understanding information) not really worth the time, effort, or cost of the endeavor. The entire process could take you or your IT person days, if not weeks. With Wufoo, you can skip all the hard stuff (because it does it all for you) and start getting things done.
