# Privacy Statement | Wufoo

Last updated: January 18, 2016

* * *

Wufoo is an online form builder that strives to provide the easiest way for you to collect information over the internet. Wufoo is used by people who are interested in creating forms to collect information or perform a variety of other tasks (" **Form Creators** "), and by people who fill out these forms (" **Form Respondents** "). Wufoo is a service provided by SurveyMonkey.

This privacy statement describes privacy practices which are specific to Wufoo and should be read in conjunction with [SurveyMonkey’s main Privacy Policy](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/policy/privacy-policy/), which also applies to Wufoo to the extent that it is applicable and does not conflict with this privacy statement. In the event of any conflict between this Wufoo Privacy Statement and SurveyMonkey’s main Privacy Policy, this Wufoo Privacy Statement shall prevail only with respect to the terms that are specific to Wufoo, and SurveyMonkey’s main Privacy Policy shall otherwise govern.

Infinity Box Inc. (the provider of Wufoo in the United States) complies with the [US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/) developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from EU member countries and Switzerland. We have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement. View our certification on the U.S. Department of Commerce's [Safe Harbor website](https://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx).

If you feel your question has not been satisfactorily addressed, you may [contact BBB](http://www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints), which operates an independent dispute resolution mechanism.

This privacy statement is split into two sections: one for **Form Creators** , and one for **Form Respondents**.

### PRIVACY FOR FORM CREATORS

**1\. What information does SurveyMonkey collect?**

  * **Registration information.** You need a Wufoo account before you can create forms on Wufoo. When you register for an account, we collect your username, email address and password. We also collect your name if you supply it in the account management section. Some Wufoo account plans permit you to create accounts for other Form Creators under your own account. When you create accounts for these additional Form Creators, we collect their name and email address. 
  * **Form data.** We store your form data (form content and responses) for you.



**2\. How does SurveyMonkey use the information we collect?**

We use the information we collect in accordance with [SurveyMonkey’s main Privacy Policy](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/policy/privacy-policy/) for survey creators (except that references to survey data should be read as references to form data in the context of Wufoo). We would like to emphasize that we will not use your form data to compete with you, market to your clients, or contact them for any other means of profit. We will not sell your form data.

**3\. With whom do we share or disclose your information?**

We disclose the information we collect in accordance with [SurveyMonkey’s main Privacy Policy](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/policy/privacy-policy/) for survey creators (except that references to survey data should be read as references to form data in the context of Wufoo). 

**4\. What are your rights to your information?**

You can:

  * **Update your account details.** You can update your registration and other account information on your account management page. Information is updated immediately. 
  * **Download/backup your form data.** We provide you with the ability to export, share and publish your form data in a variety of formats. This allows you to create your own backups or work with your data offline. [See here for data exporting instructions](http://help.wufoo.com/articles/en_US/SurveyMonkeyArticleType/Entry-Manager#export). 
  * **Delete your form data.** You can delete your form data (including parts of forms, entire forms and responses to forms) through your account’s user interface. [See here for how to delete form entries](http://help.wufoo.com/articles/en_US/SurveyMonkeyArticleType/Entry-Manager#delete). 
  * **Cancel your Wufoo account.** You can cancel your Wufoo account at any time through your account management page. Any cancellation of your Wufoo account will result in the deletion of your account and all form data stored in it. This data cannot be recovered once your account is cancelled. Please be aware that SurveyMonkey may for a time retain residual information in our backup and/or archival copies of our database which takes up to about 12 months to disappear. 



**5\. Security, cookies and other important information**

  * **Security.** Each Form Creator is assigned a unique username and password which is required to access their Wufoo account. It is each Form Creator’s responsibility to protect the security of his or her login information. Regardless of the security protections and precautions we undertake, there is always a risk that your personal data may be viewed and used by unauthorized third parties as a result of collecting and transmitting your data over the internet. 
  * **Cookies.** See SurveyMonkey’s main Privacy Policy for general information about cookies. [Click here](http://www.wufoo.com/privacy/cookies/) for information on specific cookies used by Wufoo. 
  * **Changes to this privacy statement.** This privacy statement may be changed in the same manner as changes that are made to SurveyMonkey’s main Privacy Policy. 
  * **Online tracking.** We currently do not process or comply with any web browser's "do not track" signal or other similar mechanism that indicates a request to disable online tracking of individual users who visit the Wufoo website or use the Wufoo services. 



### PRIVACY FOR FORM RESPONDENTS

**1\. What information does SurveyMonkey collect?**

  * **Responses to forms.** We collect and store the responses that you submit to forms. Form Creators are responsible for this data and manage it. A form may ask you to provide personal information or data. If you have any questions about a form you are completing, please contact the Form Creator who created the form directly as SurveyMonkey is not responsible for the content of that form. The creator of the form is usually the same person that invited you to complete the form and sometimes they have their own privacy policy. SurveyMonkey is not liable for any actions or inactions a Form Creator takes with respect to any data or information that they may collect from a Form Respondent. 



**2\. How does SurveyMonkey use the information we collect?**

We disclose the information we collect in accordance with [SurveyMonkey’s main Privacy Policy](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/policy/privacy-policy/) for survey respondents (except that references to surveys and survey data should be read as references to forms and form data in the context of Wufoo).

**3\. With whom do we share or disclose your information?**

We disclose the information we collect in accordance with [SurveyMonkey’s main Privacy Policy](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/policy/privacy-policy/) for survey respondents (except that references to surveys and survey data should be read as references to forms and form data in the context of Wufoo).

**4\. What are your rights to your information?**

  * **Contact the relevant Form Creator to access your responses.** Because we collect form responses on behalf of Form Creators, you will need to contact the Form Creator if you have any questions about the form, or if you want to access, update, or delete anything in your responses. We provide Form Creators with tools to maintain the responses they collect through their forms. SurveyMonkey cannot provide you with this access since form responses are the Form Creator’s private information. 



**5\. Security, cookies and other important information**

See section 5 of the “Privacy for Form Creators” section above.
