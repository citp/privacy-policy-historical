We respect all our patients and prospective patients’ privacy. Unless required for law enforcement or by statute, we will not share any information you supply to us via this Site to any other outside unaffiliated entity without your consent.

We want each Site visitor to find useful medical information and learning about the services of Washington University Physicians.

This information helps us know what sections of our Site are visited frequently, so we can enhance those sections and ensure the are timely. 

**Contact Us**  
We are always interested in your feedback and suggestions. Should you have any questions about the Site, or suggestions for improvement, please contact our site administrator by[ e-mail](mailto:wuphysicians@wusm.wustl.edu)
