  * the URL of the website you have previously visited,
  * the quantity of data transmitted.



For technical reasons these data are stored and are not assigned to any identifiable person at any time.

##### Data Entered by Users

You can use the Wunderlist product both with and without registering. However, you can only access Wunderlist using certain terminals such as an iPhone, iPod, iPad, Windows, Mac or Android and without additional functions. In order to make use of all its advantages, you have to register. To do this, you must enter your email address and select a password. We require these data in order to guarantee that you are able to make full use of our entire offer. We need these and possibly other data not least in order to respond to your wishes, questions and criticism.

In future, we plan to introduce an option which will allow you to design your account personally. For example, you will be able to add a photo, choose a username and set up a connection to your Facebook user account. You will not be obliged to design your account personally; this will be entirely voluntary.

The central function of Wunderlist product is task management. You will be able to use this product both online and offline.

Where Wunderlist is used solely offline, the data you enter will be stored de-centrally on your storage medium. In such a case, we will not be able to access these data.

If you use Wunderlist in combination with a registered account, all data and tasks entered will be integrated into a database. The purpose of this database is to allow you to use Wunderlist at various different levels and call up your tasks anywhere and at any time. Data are transmitted to the respective terminal using SSL encryption so that your data are transmitted securely.

We use personal data in order to enable secure, effective and user-related use of Wunderlist services, including for:

  * calling up the task-list via the internet;
