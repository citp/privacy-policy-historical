# Privacy Policy | Wunderman

**This website is provided by Wunderman. We take very seriously the privacy of our website users and the security of their personal information.**

For your convenience, this website contains links to a number of other websites, both inside and outside our company. The privacy policies and procedures described here do not apply to those sites; we suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their data collection and distribution policies.

The purpose of this privacy policy is to set out the principles governing our use of personal information that we may obtain about you. By using the websites, or by registering as a user of the services that we provide, you agree to this use. We ask you to read this privacy policy carefully.

We may change our privacy policy from time to time. We therefore ask you to check it occasionally to ensure that you are aware of the most recent version that will apply each time you access this website.

## Personal Information Collection and Use

Wunderman may collect and store personally identifiable information, such as your name or email address, when it is voluntarily submitted to us at this website. Wunderman and the companies we hire will use this information to comply with your request for information or as otherwise disclosed to you when you submit your information.

From time to time, we may refer to that information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our services. We may use that information to contact you. We will not otherwise transfer the personally identifiable information you provide at this website to any third party unless otherwise disclosed to you. Please note we do reserve the right to transfer your personally identifiable information and other information to our successors in business and purchasers of site assets.

Wunderman may also collect and store aggregate or anonymous information about user contact with and use of the Site. In addition, at time, we send your Web browser a “cookie,” a small data file that’s stored on your hard drive, to help us provide you with customized services. We do not use cookies to retrieve personal information from your computer. Information obtained in connection with the Site may be intermingled with and used by us in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Site, including both offline and online sources.

We may use the aggregate or anonymous information we collect about our customers, traffic patterns, and related site information to better design our Site and to share with reputable third-party vendors.

## Opt-out

You may ask us to delete any information about you and cease further contact at any time by sending us a request marked “Privacy-Urgent,” address as follows: [webmaster@wunderman.com](mailto:webmaster@wunderman.com).

## Security

We have a commitment to taking reasonable steps to ensure the security of your information. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put into place appropriate physical, and electronic procedures to safeguard and secure information we collect online.

## Children’s Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the young, i.e., children under the age of 13, is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our Site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Site is structured to attract anyone under 13. If a child has provided us with personal information, we ask that a parent or guardian of the child contact us at [webmaster@wunderman.com](mailto:webmaster@wunderman.com) if they would like the information submitted by a child deleted from our database. We will use all reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.

## Privacy Precautionary Warning

Please note that no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of the information that you transmit via our online services. Please note that we reserve the right to access and /or disclose the user information discussed herein (including personal information) as required by courts and/or administrative agencies and to the extent required to permit us to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of law or our Site Terms of Use or policies.

## Consent

By using our Site, you consent to the collection, use, and storage of your personal and non-personal information as described in this policy. You further authorize the export of personal information to the USA and its storage and use as specified in this policy when you provide such information to us. This policy and all legal obligations of Wunderman are subject to the laws of New York and the USA, regardless of the location of any user. Any claims or complaints must be filed in the USA in the State of New York.
