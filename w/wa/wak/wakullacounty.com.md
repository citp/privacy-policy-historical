When you visit our Website you may provide us with two types of information: personally identifiable information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis (including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number and email address) and non-personal, aggregate information (such as information regarding the pages on our Website that you have visited, your IP address, website browser, operating system, polling modules or surveys).

**A. Personally Identifiable Information:** The only personally identifying information that we collect and store about you is the information that you choose to provide to us. For example, we gather your personally identifiable information when you send us an email, sign-up for our newsletter, fill out any of our online forms, enter a contest, sweepstakes or promotion, register a new account or sign-in to an existing account.

This information may be aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the Website, pages viewed, time and date of visits, and other similar information. We collect all of this information to allow us to detect broad demographic trends, to provide information tailored to your interests and to enhance your experience on the Website. We may use and disclose Website non-personally identifiable usage information, for example, to measure the use of our Website, explain the usefulness of our Website, and to improve the content of our Website.  
**C. Cookies:** The Website may use cookies depending on the features offered. Cookies are useful for gathering information such as browser type and operating system, tracking the number of visitors to the Website, and understanding how visitors use the Website. A cookie is a small piece of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return to our Website. You may be able to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. Personal information cannot be collected via cookies, however, if you previously provided personally identifiable information, cookies may be tied to such information. Our cookies collect general information that enhances our ability to serve you and measure the usefulness of our Website.

**V. Third Party Ad Server Networks**

The Website may use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on the Website and may use traffic measurement services to analyze traffic on the Website. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to the Website and other Websites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. The Website's third party ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies on your computer if you choose to have cookies enabled in your browser and track certain behavioral information regarding users of your computer via a Device Identifier. These third party cookies are set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Third party cookies and web beacons are governed by each third party's specific Privacy Policy, not this one.

Any information you share in a public forum is public information and may be seen or collected by anyone, including third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for events arising from the distribution of any information you choose to publicly post or share through our Website.

**VII. Keeping Your Information Secure**

We have implemented security measures we consider reasonable and appropriate to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and are not responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personally identifiable information. In the unfortunate event that your "personally identifiable information" (as the term or similar terms are defined by any applicable law requiring notice upon a security breach) is compromised, we may notify you by e-mail (at our sole and absolute discretion) to the last e-mail address you have provided us in the most expedient time reasonable under the circumstances; provided, however, delays in notification may occur while we take necessary measures to determine the scope of the breach and restore reasonable integrity to the system as well as for the legitimate needs of law enforcement if notification would impede a criminal investigation. From time to time we evaluate new technology for protecting information, and when appropriate, we upgrade our information security systems.
