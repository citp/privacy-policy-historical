##  How do we collect this data?

##  Will we share your information with third parties? 

No. We will never make your personal data available to companies outside of Wakoopa. 

In specific instances, companies that render IT services to us will have access to your details. 

These suppliers are not authorised to use your information for any purpose other than that for which we have contracted them. 

##  How do we protect your data? 

Wakoopa has implemented all reasonable security measures to protect your information from third parties. These measures are intended to prevent your personal data from being lost or being accessed by an unauthorized third party. 

However, like any data transmission made via Internet, there is a small risk. If you continue to use our services, we will consider that you accept this small risk which is inherent to any data transmission. 

##  Our Representative for Data Protection 

At Wakoopa we have a team specialized in Privacy and Protection of Personal Data. If you wish to contact them, you can do so by email or post to the addresses specified above. 

##  Security breaches 

In the unlikely case that any technical, organizational, or any other type of failure occurs, beyond our control, which may in some way compromise the security of your data, we will notify you immediately and inform you of the consequences that this situation may entail. In the same way, we will also inform you about the measures that we will take to solve the problem. 

Remember that, if you consider that your rights have been violated, you can always submit a claim to the competent control authority, in this case, before the Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens. 

##  Data retention policy 

Due to our intention to minimize the use of personal data, we are committed to eliminate all information about you that is not strictly necessary to provide our services. As well as erase it, in any case, after a long period of time since our last contact. 

##  Mobility of the data 

Wakoopa is an internet-based company, so our business is developed internationally, and our customers and suppliers are companies located in countries around the world. 

In this sense, Wakoopa has a worldwide network of technical or logistic providers that help us provide our services and that need to access your personal data. 

This means that we have to transfer your data to other countries to carry out our mission. However, we make sure that all these companies comply with an adequate level of security and are committed to the protection of your data.
