# Privacy Policy

At WAWAZA, your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices.

### The Information We Collect

On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are name, address, email address, and phone number. You can submit information about other people if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient.

We automatically collect non-personal information such as browser type and operating system to evaluate and improve the performance of our services.

### The Way We Use Information

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. We do not use email addresses for any other purpose and do not share them with outside parties.

### Our Commitment To Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. These include measures such as SSL data encryption and server security scans.

### Our Commitment To Minors Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important to us. We do not collect or maintain information at our website from those we know are under 18, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 18.
