<h3>
	Use of Cookies and Other Technology Related Information by TakePart
</h3>
<p>
	Cookies are small files containing a string of characters sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser.&nbsp; TakePart uses cookies to store visitors' preferences and to record session information.&nbsp; These uses include serving content recommendations specific to your interests.&nbsp; We do not link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit while on the Site, although your password will be link to cookies so your password does not need to be re-entered when you visit the Site.

<p>
	TakePart may also use web beacons (also known as "pixel tags" or “clear GIFs”) which are small graphic files that allow TakePart to monitor the use of the TakePart website. A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the type of browser that fetched the pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. You can disable pixel tags by changing your browser settings to omit images and disable Javascript; or there are commercial software packages available that can omit pixel tags and most advertisements.
