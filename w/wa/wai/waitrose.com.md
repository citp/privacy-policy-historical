## Problems with Internet Explorers version 5.0 and earlier

If you are using IE4 or some versions of IE 5.0, you may get a warning message telling you that our certificate has expired, is not yet valid or is not to be trusted. However this is just an error in your browser interface; if you click 'yes' to proceed, your connection will in fact be secure, and you will be able to carry on shopping safely. You can confirm that your connection is secure by right-clicking on the page and selecting 'properties'. In the pop-up box the connection should say 'SSL' and will also tell you the type of encryption.

The message occurs because the Server Connection Authority has renewed the keys with which they sign all Certificates and some older browsers do not recognise the new keys.

We recommend that you use IE 5.5 above to avoid this issue.

## Safe internet shopping

With more and more people regularly using the Internet, it is important to ensure your safety when you buy online.

We are keen to raise awareness of best practice at Waitrose.com and as such we are pleased to support the Department of Trade and Industry's Safe Internet Shopping initiative, whose aim is to ensure that you are fully aware of your consumer rights when you buy online.

There are 5 key tips for Safe Shopping Online:

## Payment:

If your credit or debit card is used fraudulently in the EU, the card company must refund you.

## Websites:

Use ones you know or which are recommended and always get the supplier's phone number and postal address.

## Records:

Keep a copy of what you've ordered, plus the supplier's confirmation message.

## Quality:

Your high street consumer rights apply online.

## Cooling off:

In many cases in the EU the law lets you change your mind and get a refund within 7 working days of the delivery.

The Government website [www.consumer.gov.uk](http://www.consumer.gov.uk/consumer_web/e-shopping.htm "This link will open in a new window") contains all the above tips as well as any other information you should need about shopping online safely.

## Credit card safety

Waitrose offers a number of online shopping services such as wines,flowers & gifts from Waitrose Direct, or groceries from Waitrose Deliver. All our websites use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt your details as they are being transmitted to us. This prevents anyone from eavesdropping on your shopping session and keeps your card and personal details private. Once your order is processed, the payment details associated with your order are removed from our files.

You can tell when you enter a secure area of our websites, as a small locked padlock will appear in the bottom bar of your browser. The security of our websites is independently verified. Follow the links below to view the security certificates for our websites.
