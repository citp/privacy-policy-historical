## List of Features and Review of WannaMeet App

There's no doubt that the evolution of communication technology, embodied primarily by smartphones has changed the way we communicate, and even how we establish relationships. In the old days, if you wanted to meet someone to see if there was a spark, you'd have to set up a first-date, find out about the other person and sometimes endure an evening of dead space between the useless banter. But no longer.

Now there are apps that take all the guesswork out of meeting someone you'd actually want to spend time with, and the latest entrant into this field is WannaMeet The application provides a platform for free dating experience. Let's take a look at what the app offers you and how it stacks up in the already-crowded field of social networking.
