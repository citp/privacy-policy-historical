  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    This privacy policy applies to Wanted Technologies Corporation's ("Wanted" or
    "us") "WANTED Analytics Apps platform" service (the "Service") available at
    <a href="http://www.wantedtech.com/">www.wantedtech.com</a> or
    <a href="../">www.wantedanalytics.com</a> (the "Sites").
  </p>
  <p>
    To demonstrate our commitment to the privacy of the users of the Service, we
    wish to disclose our information practices with respect to the Service:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      What personally identifiable information Wanted collects
    </li>
    <li>
      How Wanted uses that information
    </li>
    <li>
      With whom Wanted may share user information
    </li>
    <li>
      What choices are available to users regarding collection, use and distribution of the information
    </li>
    <li>
      What types of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Wanted's control
    </li>
    <li>
      How users can correct any inaccuracies in the information
    </li>
    <li>
      If you have questions or concerns regarding this privacy statement, please contact us at: <img src="../images/email_privacy.gif" alt="Privacy email address">.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
  <p>
    If you are an individual, when you sign up for the Service, Wanted will ask
    for information allowing us to identify you and create your password-protected
    account, such as your full name, address, employer, e-mail address and
    telephone number. In the case of corporate users of the Service, Wanted will
    ask for the same information with respect to the employee(s) or other
    person(s) authorized to use the Service on the corporation's behalf. This
    information will be used to create and maintain your account for as long as
    you are a user of the service (and in the case of corporate users, for as long
    as the employee(s) or other person(s) remain authorized to use the Service on
    the corporation user's behalf), unless and to the extent a longer retention is
    permitted or required by law.
  </p>

  <h3>General</h3>
  <p>
    You may withdraw your consent to our use of your personal information at any
    time by contacting us at <img src="../images/email_privacy.gif" alt="Privacy email address">.
    However, withdrawing your consent will prevent you from having access to the Service.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wanted is not responsible for the privacy policies and content of any website
    to which the Sites link. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of
    these sites, as they will differ from ours.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wanted uses all reasonable precautions to keep secure any information we
    collect as part of our secure network. We have security measures in place to
    protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of data under our control.
  </p>

  <h3>Integrity</h3>
  <p>
    Wanted collects and stores personal information only for the purposes for
    which it was collected and in accordance with this statement. Our goal is to
    only collect, store and process such personal information that is needed to
    provide or improve our service offering. We take reasonable steps to ensure
    that the personal information we use is accurate, complete, and current, but
    it is ultimately the users that are in a position to allow us achieving that
    goal and by updating or correcting their personal information whenever
    necessary.
  </p>

  <h3>Accessing and updating</h3>
  <p>
    We take reasonable steps to provide you with access to your personal
    information and to either correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete
    that data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by
    law. In order to do so, we will ask individuals to identify themselves and
    which information they would like to access, correct or remove before
    processing such requests. In any case, we perform this service free of charge,
    except if doing so would require disproportionate efforts on our part.
  </p>

  <h3>Information security</h3>
  <p>
    We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access
    to or unauthorized disclosure or destruction of data, including any personal
    information collected and stored on its infrastructure. These include internal
    monitoring of our processes, practices and security measures, as well as
    physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems
    where we store personal information.
  </p>
  <p>
    We restrict access to personal information only to our employees, contractors
    and agents who need to access or know that information in order to develop,
    operate or improve our service offering. These individuals are bound by
    confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including
    termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
  </p>

  <h3>Changes</h3>
  <p>
    If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this
    privacy statement on the Sites and other places that we deem appropriate so
    our users are aware of what information we collect and how we use it. We will
    use information in accordance with the privacy statement under which the
    information was collected. If, however, we are going to use your personal and
    contact information in a manner different from that stated at the time of
    collection, we will obtain your consent prior to this new use.
  </p>

  <h3>Sharing Information</h3>
  <p>
    WANTED may retain third party service providers to facilitate or outsource one
    or more aspects of the Service or other aspects of WANTED's business. Such
    service providers include payment processors, data storage facilities and
    professional advisors. These service providers are subject to confidentiality
    obligations towards WANTED. If you become a paying customer of the Service,
    you agree that WANTED can disclose to such third party services providers your
    personal information, the fact that you are a paying customer and the edition
    of the Service that you are using.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may also need to
    disclose personal information when required by law if we have a good-faith
    belief that such action is necessary to comply with an appropriate law
    enforcement investigation, current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal
    process served on our website.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may enter into discussions or negotiations with a third party (anywhere in
    the world) regarding the sale of all (or substantially all) of our business or
    the acquisition of a controlling interest in our share capital. Since customer
    information and data would normally be a part of such a transaction, Wanted
    reserves the right to transfer any information you submit and we retain to
    that third party as part of due diligence activities or to complete the
    transaction.
  </p>

  <h3>Contact Us</h3>
  <p>
    If you require further information or if we can be of any assistance with
    respect to privacy issues, updating your contact information, or the practices
    of the Sites, please contact us at <img src="../images/email_privacy.gif" alt="Privacy email address">.
