At wanderingeducators.com ("WE"), we strive to develop and present innovative </p>
<p>products and services to benefit our users and registered users (("Members").  We </p>
<p>recognize that privacy is an important issue, so we design and operate our products </p>
<p>and services with your privacy in mind.  This wanderingeducators.com Privacy Policy </p>
<p>outlines the types of personal information we may collect when you use our service </p>
<p>("Service"), which is described in greater detail in the Terms of Service ("TOS"), </p>
<p>available at <a href="http://www.wanderingeducators.com/tos" title="http://www.wanderingeducators.com/tos">http://www.wanderingeducators.com/tos</a>, as well as some of the steps </p>
<p>we take to secure it.</p>
<p><b><br>
What this policy covers</b>
</p>
<p>
<b></b><br>
Your privacy is very important to us.  This page will show our firm commitment to your </p>
<p>privacy.  This policy covers how we treat personal information that we may collect or </p>
<p>receive from you when you use our service.  "Personal information" is information </p>
<p>about you that is personally identifiable, such as your social security number, name, </p>
<p>address, name, address, email address, or phone number.</p>
<p>wanderingeducators.com will not sell, loan, rent, lease, barter, or publish your </p>
<p>personal information to a third party.  All data that we keep on you is kept strictly for </p>
<p>wanderingeducators.com business use, to assist you in your current or future </p>
<p>purchases or in analyzing sales trends.  No customer data is stored on servers that are </p>
<p>accessible to the internet.  All data is downloaded and deleted from our internet </p>
<p>server several times a day.</p>
<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies and/or other entities that </p>
<p>WE does not own or control, to people that are not managed or employed by WE, </p>
<p>and/or to operators of sites which are linked to or from wanderingeducators.com</p>
<p><b><br>
Data and Information Collection and Use</b></p>
<p><b><br>
General</b></p>
<p>WE collects information from and about you when you register with WE as a </p>
<p>member, and when you use WE's service.</p>
<p>Users who visit WE's site and do not register do not need to provide any personal </p>
<p>information.  WE does, however, collect limited, non-personally identifying </p>
<p>information from non-registered users that browsers make available whenever a user </p>
<p>visits a website.  This information includes your internet protocol (IP) address, browser </p>
<p>type, browser language, cookies, and use patterns.</p>
<p>When you register as a Member, we ask for personal information from you, which </p>
<p>may include your name, email address, date of birth, gender, zip code, personal </p>
<p>interested, and a password.  Your password will be maintained on our system in an </p>
<p>encrypted form and you will be able to create a unique username that will identify </p>
<p>you during login and when you are using the service.  Please note that WE owns your </p>
<p>username, grants you a license to use it while you are a Member, and reserves all </p>
<p>rights to your username once you either cease to be a Member or following an </p>
<p>extended period of inactivity, including but not limited to the right to revoke, reuse, </p>
<p>resell, or license your username.</p>
<p>Certain members may opt to particiapte in programs offered by WE where a </p>
<p>member can earn WE Marketplace dollars. If you participate in such programs, WE </p>
<p>may require you to provide additional information, including but not limited to your </p>
<p>social security number.  All such information will be maintained in secure and </p>
<p>encrypted areas of our system.</p>
<p>Once you register with WE and sign into our site, you are not anonymous to us.</p>
<p>WE uses the information collected for the following purposes: to customize the </p>
<p>advertising and content that you see, to fulfill requests for products and service, to </p>
<p>improve our service, to contact you, to conduct research, and to provide </p>
<p>anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.<br>
<b><br>
Publishing on wanderingeducators.com</b></p>
<p>Use care when posting personal information or personal content on our Service, </p>
<p>particularly sensitive information such as social security numbers, financial </p>
<p>information, home addresses, or phone numbers.</p>
<p>You should be aware that, when you post information in WE, the information that </p>
<p>you post - including but not limited to the content of the post, header information, </p>
<p>username, and email address associated with the posting - may be read, copied, </p>
<p>used, and redistributed by people you do not not.  </p>
<p>The contents of the postings that you submit to the service are stored and </p>
<p>maintained on our servers in order to publish the postings and provide the service.  in </p>
<p>order to protect our Members from email harvesting software and bots, we attempt </p>
<p>to "mask" email addresses so that they are typically human readable but not </p>
<p>machine readable. In addition, we collect and maintain information about your </p>
<p>account activity, such as the contents of your posts, the links that you click on, </p>
<p>search inquiries, postings that you comment upon, and your preferred settings when </p>
<p>using the service.</p>
<p><b><br>
Children</b></p>
<p>To comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, the service is only </p>
<p>available to users and Members who are at least 13 years old.  If you are under 13, </p>
<p>you may NOT use wanderingeducators.com. </p>
<p>WE needs to ask all users, including children under the age of 13, for certain personal </p>
<p>information that is reasonably necessary to determine the user's eligibility to </p>
<p>participate on and belong to the site.</p>
<p><b><br>
Contests</b></p>
<p>WE runs contests on our site in which we may ask visitors for contact information </p>
<p>(typically, the user's email address) and demographic information (i.e., zip code, </p>
<p>age, or income level).  WE will never disclose this information; it is only used to </p>
<p>provide contact information for the winners, and demographic data for our contest </p>
<p>sponsors.</p>
<p>At times, WE will run contests that will require a written entry, in the form of an </p>
<p>"article," i.e., a story for the funniest travel stories contest.  These written entry contests </p>
<p>will be judged anonymously by published authors, photographers, and/or educators, </p>
<p>and said prizes will be awarded to the winner(s).</p>
<p>At times, WE will run contests for increasing membership.  All members who </p>
<p>participate in such contests will have their results tallied by an independent </p>
<p>organization, and contact informatio used only to award prize(s) to the winner(s).</p>
<p><b><br>
Information Sharing and Disclosure</b></p>
<p>WE does not rent, sell, share, or otherwise disclose personal information about you </p>
<p>with other people or non-affiliated companies, except to provide products or </p>
<p>services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following </p>
<p>circumstances:</p>
<p>a. WE may provide information to trusted partners who work on our behalf and who </p>
<p>have entered into confidentiality agreemens with us.<br>
b. WE responds to valid subpoenas, court orders, and other legal proceedings. We </p>
<p>also may disclose information if we deem it necessary to exercise our own legal rights </p>
<p>or to defend ourselves against legal claims.<br>
c. WE will share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding </p>
<p>illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical </p>
<p>safety of any person, violations of our TOS, or as otherwise required by state or federal </p>
<p>law.<br>
d. WE may transfer information about you if we are acquired or merged with another </p>
<p>company.</p>
<p><b><br>
Financial Information Security</b></p>
<p>Financial information that is collected by wanderingeducators.com is only used to </p>
<p>bill the member for products and services ordered through the WE Marketplace.</p>
<p>You can enter your credit card number on a secure (https) form and transmit the </p>
<p>form over the internet to a secure server without risk of an intermediary obtaining </p>
<p>your credit card information.  The security features offered by your web browser </p>
<p>technology protects commercial transactions, as well as all other communications, </p>
<p>from misappropriation and fraud that could otherwise occur as information passes </p>
<p>through internet computers.</p>
<p>With SSL implemented on both the client and server, your internet communications </p>
<p>are transmitted in encrypted form.  Information you send can be trusted to arrive </p>
<p>privately and unaltered to the server you specify (and no other).</p>
<p>SSL uses authentication and encryption technology.  For example, your browsers </p>
<p>export implementation of SSL (U.S. government approved) uses a high-grade, 128-bit </p>
<p>key size.  The encryption established between you and a server remains valid over </p>
<p>multiple connections, yet the effort expended to defeat the encryption of one </p>
<p>message cannot be leveraged to defeat the next message.</p>
<p>Your browser and secure servers deliver server authenticatin using signed digital </p>
<p>certificates issued by trusted third parties known as certificate authorities.  A digital </p>
<p>certificate verifies the connectino between a server's public key and the server's </p>
<p>identification (as a driver's license verifies the connection between your photograph </p>
<p>and your personal identification).  Cryptographic checks, using digital signatures, </p>
<p>ensure that information within a certificate can be trusted. </p>
<p>You know that you have a secure connection when you look at the location (URL) </p>
<p>field.  If the URL begins with https:// (instead of http://), the document comes from a </p>
<p>secure server.  To connect to an HTTP server that provides security using the SSL </p>
<p>protocol, insert the letter "s" so that the URL begins with https://.  You need to use </p>
<p>https:?? for HTTP URLs with SSL and http:// for HTTP URLs without SSL.</p>
<p>You can also verify the security of a webpage by examining the security icon in the </p>
<p>bottom left corner of your browser window.</p>
<p>Only your computer and the server can encrypt and decrypt your information.  In </p>
<p>transit, the information is an unreadable mess.  An intermediary can route the data, </p>
<p>and even copy it, but the information cannot be de-encrypted, and thus remains </p>
<p>private and safely communicated.</p>
<p><b><br>
Information Security</b></p>
<p>WE takes appropriate physical and electronic measures to protect against </p>
<p>unauthorized access to, alteration of, and disclosure of personal information.</p>
<p>Access to personal information is limited to employees who need to know that </p>
<p>information in order to successfully provide our service.  All our employees enter into </p>
<p>confidentiality agreements with WE.</p>
<p><b><br>
Cookies</b></p>
<p>WE may set and access "cookies" on your computer.  A "cookie" is a small file, </p>
<p>containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a </p>
<p>website.  We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, target advertising, </p>
<p>and to better understand how our members interact with us.  We do this by storing </p>
<p>user preferences in cookies and by tracking user trends and patterns of how you use </p>
<p>our service.  Most browsers are set up to accept cookies.  You can reset your browser </p>
<p>to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent, but this will impact </p>
<p>the quality and speed of your user experience on the site.</p>
<p><b><br>
Your Ability to Edit and Delete Account Information</b></p>
<p>You may edit your personal profice and related personal information at any time by </p>
<p>visiting your account at wanderingeducators.com</p>
<p>You may delete your member account by sending an email to </p>
<p><a href="mailto:support@wanderingeducators.com">support@wanderingeducators.com</a></p>
<p><b><br>
Changes to this Policy</b></p>
<p>WE may update and change this Policy from time to time.<br>
All updates and changes will be posted to this webpage.<br>
We will notify you directly if we make significant changes to this Privacy Policy.
