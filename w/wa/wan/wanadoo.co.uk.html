These cookies may be used to tailor the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our websites. For example, if you personalise webpages, or register for products or services, a cookie helps our webpage server to recall your specific information. When you next visit our website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose.  Even if you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we can link cookies together so you will still receive a personalised online experience. We can also personalise the information you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things.

In the course of serving these ads, our own unique cookies and/or third-party cookies may be placed or recognised on your browser.

These cookies may be used to tailor the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our website. For example, if you personalise webpages, or register for products or services, a cookie helps our webpage server to recall your specific information.

Even if you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we can link cookies together so you will still receive a personalised online experience.

We don't allow them to use this information for their own commercial purposes and they have to follow our strict instructions and comply with appropriate security measures. We store all your account details and other such information on secure servers, adhering strictly to all relevant UK legislation. We use encrypted transmission links whenever we can.

            "><strong>Security</strong><br><br><strong>Contacting us by email or phone</strong><br>We recommend you set up a Customer Services password to protect your account details. If you don't already have one it's simple to set one up next time you call. Some customers may use a PIN as part of our automated telephone system. Once you have a PIN this is all you will need when you call us - though you'll still need your Customer Services password if you email. You must set up a Customer Services Password or PIN if you want anyone other than yourself to access your account. If we need to call you for any reason we will not ask you to reveal your password to us. <br><br><strong>Reviewing your account online</strong><br>You will need to set up a separate username and password to access your account details online. <br><br><strong>Spoof websites and email security alerts</strong><br>Fraudsters create authentic looking, but false or 'spoof' websites. Their purpose is to tempt users to divulge personal information. This information will be re-used to try and access your bank accounts. Fraudsters are increasingly turning to email to generate traffic to these websites. If you get any email containing an embedded link and a request for you to enter any personal details, treat it as suspicious and do not provide any personal information, even if the page appears legitimate. No reputable company ever sends emails of this type.<br><br><strong>Identity fraud</strong><br>If you believe you may have fallen victim to identity fraud or impersonation, CIFAS (the UK's Fraud Prevention Service) advises you take the following steps:<ol><li>Obtain a copy of your credit file from the credit reference agencies (see the CIFAS Website at www.identityfraud.org.uk Advice for Victims for further details). </li><li>Contact everyone involved immediately and keep a record of all of your actions (who you spoke to and when, copies of letters sent and received etc). </li><li>Immediately report the incident to the police, especially if it involves stolen identification documents. Insist on receiving a Crime Reference Number or some documentation to record the incident. </li><li>If a passport or driving licence is stolen or lost it should be reported to the authorities as soon as the loss is known. Also report any suspicious circumstances. </li><li>Immediately report all stolen cheques or cards to the issuers, and request new ones. Follow up telephone calls with written notification. Get new cards, account numbers and PINs if you use credit or other plastic cards to access banking services. Don't continue to use a compromised PIN. </li><li>Notify Royal Mail immediately if you suspect mail theft or suspect a mail redirection has been fraudulently set-up on your address - they have an investigations unit who will be able to help.</li></ol> If you believe you may have fallen victim (i.e. you have received a bill for an account or additional number which fraudulently uses your details), you should contact us as soon as possible.</span></div><div class="advanced-list-back-to-top"><a href="#advanced-list-header">back to top</a></div></li><li><a name="advanced9" id="advanced9"></a><p class="advanced-list-header">9. Location Services</p><span class="STxt
            ">We need to know approximately where you are so that we can deliver mobile phone services to you. Location information (such as your Cell ID) is relayed to us and some of our partners when your phone is turned on or when you use the services. This information will also be shared with the emergency services so that when you make an emergency call, the emergency services are able to respond more quickly to the call. Location information cannot usually be used to pinpoint exactly where you are. For example, it cannot usually be used to determine which particular house or shop you are in at a given time. Instead it offers an approximate location based on your position relative to the nearest mobile phone masts. The accuracy of this information depends on how close you are to a mobile phone mast and is likely to be more accurate in urban areas compared to rural areas.This location information may also be used to provide you with services that are linked to your location such as: <ol><li>traffic reports</li><li>entertainment listings</li><li>targeted offers (as further described in our section 3 how we use your personal information)</li><li>map services (for this, we will use your GPS location if enabled on your phone)</li></ol>   Some of these services are called active location services because you are asking us to check your location in order for the service to be provided. There are other forms of location based services where you might agree to be located by someone else or you might want to locate someone else using the location information we generate. These services are called passive location services. We describe our phone locator services and other passive location based services offered by our partners below.Phone locator servicesWe have put in place measures that fully comply with the Industry Code of Practice for the Use of Mobile Phone Technology to Provide Passive Location Services in the UK ("the Code").These include measures to verify the identity of the person wishing to use the passive location service and to ensure the ongoing consent of the person whose phone is being located. For more information about the Code please click on www1.orange.co.uk/codesofpractice. One of the key requirements of this Code is that the person who is to be located must consent to being located and regular reminders about the location service must be sent to their mobile phone so that they can opt out at any time. Other passive location servicesYou may receive certain passive location services in circumstances where you have adjusted settings or activated certain features on your phone. For example, if your phone has 'Bluetooth' enabled, you may receive messages from third parties located nearby. If you do not wish to receive these services, we suggest you de-activate the relevant feature(s) on your phone or contact the third parties directly.</span><div class="advanced-list-back-to-top"><a href="#advanced-list-header">back to top</a></div></li><li><a name="advanced10" id="advanced10"></a><p class="advanced-list-header">10.
