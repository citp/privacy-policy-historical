We utilize cookie technology to collect data regarding the number of visits a person has made to our site. This data is stored in aggregate form and is in no way singled out in an individual file. This information allows us to know what pages/sites are of interest to our users and what pages/sites may be of less interest.

We also collect personally identifiable information from users through voluntary submissions.

If a sweepstakes or contest winner is under 18 years old, we will require a consent form signed by the winner's parent or guardian in order to award the prize. We have taken steps to ensure that personally identifiable information collected is secure, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to its database servers, as well as electronic security systems and password protections which guard against unauthorized access.
