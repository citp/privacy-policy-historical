# Privacy Policy - Wanderlust Travel Magazine

This privacy policy covers the websites www.wanderlust.co.uk and www.gowander.com which are owned and operated by Wanderlust Publications Ltd, Leworth Place, Mellor Walk, Windsor, Berks SL4 1EB Great Britain, hereinafter referred to as ‘Wanderlust’. Reference to ‘website’ or ‘websites’ in this document means both websites.

Wanderlust takes the privacy of its users seriously. Generally, you can browse through our websites without giving us any information about yourself (including your email address). When we do need your personal information to place an order or when you choose to provide us with your personal information in order to be able to access restricted content or interact with our websites, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal information.

If we decide to change our privacy policy for this Website, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.

The information we collect via this website may include:   
a) Personal details you type in and submit, such as name, address, email address, etc.; 

b) data which allows us to recognise you, your preferences and how you use this website. This saves you from re-entering information when you return to the site. This data is collected by cookies from your navigation around the site. A cookie is a small amount of data which we send to your computer. The data is then stored on your browser or hard disk. Most web browsers can be set to prevent you from receiving new cookies, notify you before accepting cookies or disable cookies altogether. Details about this can normally be found in the Help facility provided with your browser. If you disable cookies, you will not be able to receive personalised facilities and your progress to check-out may take longer. The cookies store information only for as long as you are viewing the website.
