# Wappalyzer - Privacy Policy

The Wappalyzer Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information when you use Wappalyzer's products and services, including information provided when you use the [Wappalyzer Firefox add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10229). In addition, the following describes our privacy practices that are specific to the Wappalyzer Firefox add-on. Wappalyzer will notify you if it materially changes these policies, at which time you will have the opportunity to discontinue using the Wappalyzer Firefox add-on. 

### Information we collect

You do not need to provide any personal information in order to download and use the Wappalyzer Firefox add-on. All of the features can be used without sharing any personally identifiable information. 

The Wappalyzer Firefox add-on has some basic features that work automatically when you use the Firefox add-on. Other features are optional and only operate and transmit data if you choose to have them enabled. 

### Basic Wappalyzer features

Any time you use the Wappalyzer Firefox add-on to analyze a website, the Firefox add-on sends basic, limited information including the domain name of the website you have visited and what system was identified on it. This data is retained in Wappalyzer's server logs and protected according to our general Privacy Policy. At no time this data can be traced back to you personally, since no personally identifiable information is stored. 

### Information security

Any information sent to Wappalyzer will be maintained in accordance with the Wappalyzer Privacy Policy. Wappalyzer's Privacy Policy does not cover information that you send to third party sites. 

### Your choices

Any Wappalyzer feature that works by automatically sending information about sites when you visit them can be disabled and re-enabled in the add-on settings.
