					<h4>Warner Classics &amp; Jazz Privacy Policy</h4>
					<p>Thank you for visiting warnerclassicsandjazz.com – a Warner Music site operated by Warner Classics &amp; Jazz out of the United Kingdom. This Policy explains how we use information we collect about you and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this Warner Music site. By using this site you consent to your personal information being dealt with in accordance with the provisions of this policy.</p>
					<p>As Warner Music operates internationally, and some of our computer systems are currently based in the United States, your personal data may be transferred to other Warner Music companies, located within or outside of the EU (for example, your personal data may be hosted in the United States, and may be accessed by Warner Music companies worldwide.) Such recipients of your personal information may be located in countries that do not afford statutory protections for personal information equivalent to those within the EU. However please be assured that we will always take all reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected, regardless of whether it is inside the EU or transferred internationally.</p>
					<br>
					<h4>The Information We Collect and How We Use It</h4>
					<p>At some Warner Music sites, you can order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. The types of information that may be collected at these pages include: your name, e-mail address, postal address, and telephone number. We request these details in order to provide the service or product to you and to respond to any queries you may have.</p>
					<p>We may ask you for other information, including, but not limited to, your interests and musical preferences, to assist us in our initiatives outlined above and to improve our analysis of site usage. However, we will clearly mark whether or not we need such information for providing the product or service as requested.</p>
					<p>We will never send you information on our artists, products or services unless you have given us permission to do so by requesting information from this site. If you decide that you no longer wish to receive information from this site, simply send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:ukclassics@warnermusic.com">ukclassics@warnermusic.com</a> specifying the information you no longer wish to receive (or follow the "unsubscribe" instructions which are set out at the bottom of all such information emails which we send to you). Please note that if you have subscribed for information on another Warner Music site that you no longer wish to receive, you should follow the instructions set out on that site to unsubscribe.</p>
					<p>When you enter a chat-room or public forum please be aware that information you disclose in these areas (including your e-mail address) can be collected and used by people you do not know. This may result in unsolicited messages being sent to you by other organisations or individuals.</p>
					<p>At some Warner Music sites, you can submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift on-line and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address. The types of information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient's name, address, and e-mail address. We will use this information only to provide the product or service as requested. We do not send details of products and services to individuals who are only recipients of electronic greeting cards or gifts.</p>
					<br>
					<h4>Cookies</h4>
					<p>When you first visit this site we send a "cookie" to your computer primarily to enhance your online experience. "Cookies" are files that can identify you as a unique customer and may store your personal preferences as well as technical information such as the type of browser you are using. On their own cookies do not contain or reveal any personal information. However, if you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookies.</p>
					<p>We use cookies to personalise your visit to Warner Music sites (e.g., to recognise you by name when you return to this or other Warner Music sites) and to track customer trends and patterns. This helps us improve the design and content of our site for visitors and assists us in our marketing initiatives.</p>
					<p>Advertisers on this site may also send cookies to your computer if you "click" on any link or banner which takes you to an advertiser’s website. However, we have no control over the information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.</p>
					<p>Although most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, you can reset most browsers at any time to limit or refuse the use of cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, please note that, if you do this, some parts of this site may not function properly.</p>
					<br>
					<h4>Outside Parties</h4>
					<p>We may share information about visitors to this site in aggregate with third parties including advertisers, business partners, and sponsors, to analyse site usage and manage and improve our business relationships. Please be assured that before we share such information with any third parties, the information will be made anonymous so that your identity is protected.</p>
					<p>We may share personal information with third parties to administer and process your requests (e.g., when you order a product or service we may share your details with third party financial institutions to process payment for your order). We may also share your details with third parties to obtain professional advice, such as auditors.</p>
					<p>We may share your personal information with artists or their representatives in whom you have expressed an interest. If we intend to disclose your personal information to any other party who wants to market products or services to you, we will provide you with an opportunity to opt out or block such uses.</p>
					<p>Warner Music may on occasion combine information that we receive online with outside records to enhance our ability to notify you of our products and services that we think will be of interest to you.</p>
					<p>We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We may also disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request.</p>
					<p>Agents and contractors of Warner Music who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Warner Music.</p>
					<p>Although we will take all reasonable efforts to ensure that this Privacy Policy is complied with, we cannot guarantee that personal information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in requesting access to personal data, or in the unlikely event that unauthorised persons breach our security systems.</p>
					<br>
					<h4>Links &amp; Third Party Sponsors</h4>
					<p>Some of our sites contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different to ours. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement the "click" may take you off this web site. This includes links from advertisers, channel sponsors and partners that may use our logos as part of a co-branding agreement. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we are not responsible for and have no control over any information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.</p>
					<p>We sometimes may offer contests, sweepstakes, or promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with identified third parties. By virtue of their sponsorship, these third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that you voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. We are not responsible for and have no control over the third party sponsors' use of this information. However, we will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if third-party sponsors will obtain such information.</p>
					<br>
					<h4>Security</h4>
					<p>Although absolute security cannot be guaranteed on the internet, please be assured that we have in place security measures to protect the confidentiality of your information. We will continue to maintain and improve these measures over time in line with legal and technological developments.</p>
					<br>
					<h4>Access to Information</h4>
					<p>You can contact us at any time at <a href="mailto:ukclassics@warnermusic.com">ukclassics@warnermusic.com</a> to see the personal information we have collected through this site which relates to you, and to ask us to make any necessary changes to correct or update your information. To protect your privacy and security we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access.</p>
					<br>
					<h4>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h4>
					<p>If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, those changes will be posted on this page so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it.</p>
					<br>
					<h4>How to Contact Us</h4>
					<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:ukclassics@warnermusic.com">ukclassics@warnermusic.com</a></p>
					<br>
					<h4>Children</h4>
					<p>It is important to us that children can enjoy our sites in a responsible fashion. We, therefore, encourage children to consult with their parents before providing personal information. We also encourage parents to supervise their children’s online activities by, for example, adopting parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission.</p>
