These terms and conditions form a legally binding contract between us and you. Your acceptance of the terms and conditions is given when you purchase Goods from us on the Website. You should read these terms and conditions carefully before making any purchases from the Website.

We reserve the right to change the terms and conditions under which the Website and the Goods are provided, at any time (subject always to your legal rights). Any such change in the terms and conditions will be effective to all new orders once the changes are included in the text of these terms and conditions and published on the Website. You should check the terms and conditions posted on the Website periodically to ensure that you are aware of and comply with the latest version of the terms and conditions.

When we use the words "writing'" or "written" in these terms and conditions, this includes emails.

### Part 1 - Our Website and Goods

This Part 1 sets out some terms about information on the Website, descriptions of Goods and how you use the Website.

Separate notices and disclaimers may apply to your use of the Website. By accepting these terms and conditions you also agree to the notices and disclaimers.

We try to make sure that all information on the Website, including descriptions of our Goods, and listed prices, are accurate and correct at all times. However, in the event that a mistake occurs, we will try to rectify it as soon as reasonably possible. If we think that such an error has affected your purchase of Goods, we will try to notify you of this. Note that, in any case, we will not be liable to you for any errors on the Website.

You should bear in mind that buying clothing and accessories over the internet provides a different shopping experience to buying in-store. In particular you acknowledge that:

### Part 2 - Buying Goods and Delivery

This Part 2 sets out terms which apply to your purchase of Goods from us through the Website.

  * Adding goods to your shopping basket
  * Checkout step 1 – Login details
  * Checkout step 2 – address details; and
  * Checkout step 3 – payment details and Confirmation of Order



Your Order only constitutes an offer to purchase Goods from us, and does not form a binding contract until it is accepted by us. When you order more than one (1) item, your Order contains a series of offers for each item individually.

On receipt of your Order, we will send you an Order acknowledgement email to the email address which you provide in the Order process. This Order acknowledgement email will contain your Order number, details of the Goods ordered and a delivery estimate. Note that this email is only to acknowledge that your Order has been received, and is not acceptance by us of any offers to purchase Goods. You may withdraw your offer at any time before we accept your Order without any liability.

We must receive full payment both of the price of the Goods and any applicable delivery charges before we can accept any offers. Where you select to pay by Mastercard, Visa, JCB, Delta, American Express we will process the payment at the time of preparing your Goods for dispatch. If paying via PayPal or Warehouse card we will process the payment at the point of order.

An offer made by you to purchase Goods shall only be deemed to be accepted by us when we dispatch the Goods to you and send you an Order dispatch email which includes details of the Goods being dispatched. We reserve the right to refuse any offers in an Order prior to acceptance. If a particular item that you have ordered is not available, we will inform you of this in the Order dispatch email. Any Goods which are not available will be deleted from your Order and not form part of any contract between you and us.

All prices and charges on the Website are in UK pounds sterling (although we may provide an indicative price in other currencies, this is not binding). Delivery charges may apply and these will be displayed in the order process.

All prices are, unless otherwise stated, inclusive of UK VAT and other applicable UK taxes. Our VAT number is: 927570405. The actual price charged if you reside overseas will be subject to the exchange rate applied by your credit or debit card company.

If you order Goods from our Website for delivery outside the UK, they may be subject to import duties and taxes which could be levied when the delivery reaches the specified destination. You will be responsible for payment of any such import duties and taxes. Please note that we have no control over these charges and cannot predict their amount. Please contact your local customs office for further information before placing your order.

Please note that you must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the country for which the Goods are destined. We will not be liable for any breach of any such laws by you.

If you are using a Warehouse Card promotional discount code, please note this discount is only applicable when purchasing Goods with your Warehouse Card.

The personalised and/or monogrammed services offered by us are only available to you if you reside in England, Wales or Scotland. We reserve the right to reject personalised and/or monogrammed Orders, at our sole discretion, where they breach our terms and conditions, any applicable laws, decency or we suspect that they may infringe any rights of third parties. On receipt of your Order, we will send you an Order acknowledgement email to the email address which you provide in the Order process. This Order acknowledgement email will contain your Order number, details of the Goods ordered and a delivery method. Note that this email is only to acknowledge that your Order has been received, and is not acceptance by us of any offers to purchase Goods. You may withdraw your offer at any time before we accept your Order without any liability.

#### Part 2b - Delivery

We currently offer the delivery options detailed on our [delivery page](https://www.warehouse.co.uk/gb/delivery-and-returns.html).

We endeavour to ensure that the Goods that you order are provided by the agreed delivery date and, where applicable, time. However, delays could occur due to unforeseen circumstances. Neither Warehouse nor our nominated carrier shall be under any liability for any delay or failure to deliver the Goods within the estimated time frame for reasons outside of our or their control.

The risk of loss and damage of the Goods passes to you on the date and time of delivery of the Goods.

Delivery of all Goods outside of the EU will take (roughly) seven (7) - ten (10) days, except where this is not possible due to factors beyond our control.

Delivery costs in the UK and Ireland are set out on our [delivery page](https://www.warehouse.co.uk/gb/delivery-and-returns.html).

Delivery costs are as follows:

  * Europe: From €5.95 to €9.99

We ship to any British Force Post Office address ("BFPO"). The procedure is no different from mainland England shipping - simply enter your full BFPO address in the checkout including the BFPO postcode.

#### Part 2c - Buying Add-on Items(THE LITTLE THINGS)

Look for the Add-on Item messaging on our product pages:

ADD-ON ITEM.(THE LITTLE THINGS)

Add-on items are products that can be purchased only with orders of a total of £25 or more.($45 for Canada and Australia, $50 for New Zealand, 30€ for Europe, $30 for United States and 300kr for Sweden)

Add-on items must be part of an order containing at least £25 of non-add on items within the same order.

If your shopping bag contains a mix of Add-on items and other items but the other items do not reach the minimum £25 value, you will not be able to purchase your Add-on items. You can either remove the Add-on items from your bag and continue to checkout or add additional items to reach the £25 threshold.

If your basket consists entirely of Add-on items you will not be able to proceed to checkout, you’ll need to purchase additional products which are not Add-On items in order to checkout.

If we fail to comply with these terms and conditions, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking this contract or our failing to use reasonable care and skill. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time contract was made, both we and you knew it might happen, for example, if you discussed it with us during the sale process.

We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors; for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; for breach of your legal rights in relation to the Goods as set out under the heading"Your legal rights to cancel the contract (non-faulty Goods)" above.

Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms and conditions, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date. For example, if you miss a payment and we do not chase you but we continue to provide the Goods, we can still require you to make the payment at a later date. 

We operate a complaints handling procedure which we will use to try to resolve disputes when they first arise: please contact us [here](https://help.warehouse.co.uk/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000124412) if you have any complaints or comments.
