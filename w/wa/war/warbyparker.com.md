# Privacy Policy | Warby Parker

## Privacy Policy

## Effective Date: August 23, 2019

At Warby Parker, we’re all about helping you see things a little more clearly. And we believe that you have a right to know what information we collect from you and how we protect your privacy. So we’ve created this Privacy Policy to let you know what to expect when you interact with us. This Privacy Policy applies to your use of our retail locations, as well as any of our websites, website features, and mobile applications (each, an “App”) that contain a link to this Privacy Policy. 

We operate a mobile application and related website (the “Prescription Check App”) and retail store service and related website (“In-Store Prescription Check” and, together with the Prescription Check App, “Prescription Check”) that you may use for the purpose of performing a vision test that may allow you to update your eyewear prescription. We also operate MyVisionDirectory, located at [www.myvisiondirectory.com](https://www.myvisiondirectory.com/), which is a website that you may use to search for and book eye exams (“MyVisionDirectory”). This Privacy Policy applies to your use of Prescription Check and MyVisionDirectory. Collectively the retail locations, our websites and Apps, Prescription Check, and MyVisionDirectory are referred to in this Privacy Policy as the “Services”. 

Your use of Prescription Check is subject to our [Prescription Check Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/prescription-check-app/terms-of-use). Your use of all other Services is subject to our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use). Our use of any individually identifiable health information you provide is subject to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). In addition to this Privacy Policy, our [Notice of Privacy Practices](https://web.archive.org/notice-of-privacy-practices) will apply to such information. 

By using our Services, you agree to the collection, use, disclosure, and procedures this Privacy Policy describes. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to third party websites (“Third Party Services”), such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat, and Google+, that we do not own or control, even if you access them through our Services. We try to work only with Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, but we cannot take responsibility for their practices, content, or privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access so that you know how they will collect, use, and share your information.

If you have any questions, please reach out to us at [privacy@warbyparker.com](mailto:privacy@warbyparker.com).

 **Information you provide us:**

  *  **When you create an account.** When you create an account with us, you provide a name, email address, and password. 

  * **When you make a purchase or use our Services.** If you make a purchase, we request information from you to facilitate the transaction and get you the goods. You may also provide us with information when you use certain online features, such as Home Try-On or when you book an eye exam.

For some online, App, and in-store features, we may ask you to submit (or we may ask your permission to take) a photo, facial scan, or other image of you.

When you make a purchase, we ask you to provide payment information, which may include payment card information (such as credit card number, type, and expiration date), vision insurance plan information, billing address, and shipping address. Our payment processor, which is required by credit card issuers to meet specific security requirements, will collect, store, and process your credit card and other payment information on our behalf using industry-standard security measures. We do not store any payment card information.

  *  **When you use MyVisionDirectory.** When you use MyVisionDirectory, you disclose certain personal and health information about yourself, such as your name, contact information, insurance information, billing information, and exam type.

  *  **When you use Prescription Check.** When you use Prescription Check, you disclose certain information about yourself by (1) answering a series of questions to determine whether you are eligible to participate in the Prescription Check vision test (the “Eligibility Questionnaire”), (2) performing a series of tasks to help licensed optometrists or ophthalmologists (each an “Eye Doctor”) determine whether to issue you an updated eyewear prescription (the “Vision Test”), and (3) communicating with Warby Parker or our Eye Doctors in connection with your use of Prescription Check. The In-Store Prescription Check Vision Test includes an acuity test and measurement of your refractive error using a handheld device, and the results of both will be provided to us. 

"Health Information" is information that relates to your past and present health or vision conditions (including medications, ailments, and prescriptions) that is derived from your use of Prescription Check or MyVisionDirectory. Some Health Information may be subject to laws and regulations, including HIPAA. You represent that any Health Information that you disclose to us is your Health Information that you are authorized to disclose to us. “Personal Information” is information about you, including your first name, last name, and demographic information, derived from your use of Prescription Check or MyVisionDirectory. Your Warby Parker account contains Personal Information and/or Health Information, and we will access such information when you use Prescription Check. Additionally, in order to facilitate your use of Prescription Check and to help an Eye Doctor determine your need for an eyewear prescription, we may collect the following information when you use Prescription Check:

    * your name, age, email address, username, or other Personal Information or Health Information contained in your Warby Parker account
    * answers and written information that you submit during the Eligibility Questionnaire
    * your answers to, performance of, and actions taken during the Vision Test 
    * timestamps of all actions that you take within the Prescription Check App
    * Health Information prepared by an Eye Doctor who provides you Services, such as medical records, prescriptions, treatment decisions, medical advice, examination notes, and any other information prepared by an Eye Doctor about your health or vision 
    * billing information that you provide us, such as credit card information
    * any other information that you submit to us in connection with your Eligibility Questionnaire, Vision Test, Prescription Check, or the Services, including information exchanged in emails, texts, chats, or calls between you and Warby Parker.
  *  **When you contact us.** We do everything possible to make sure you have an exceptional shopping experience. If you contact us in person, by phone (calling or texting), email, instant message (including Facebook Messenger), live chat, through social media or our App, or by some other means, we may keep a record of your contact information and the content of the communication for later reference. When we send you emails, we may track whether you open them to learn how to deliver a better customer experience and improve our Services. We receive responses to any survey that you choose to complete for us.




 **Information we collect from third parties:**

  *  **Information from your doctor.** Your doctor may share your prescription information with us in order for us to provide Services or complete your purchase.

  *  **Information from third party services.** Some parts of our Services can be linked to other accounts you have with Third Party Services (“Third Party Accounts”) or you may be able to register for an account on our Services with your Third Party Account. If you connect a Third Party Account to our Services or interact with us through a Third Party Account, we may receive information about you, including your Third Party Account profile information and your photo, and your use of the Third Party Account (for example, if you select a Warby Parker product to purchase through the account). If you mention us through your Third Party Account, we may collect publicly available information and content related to your comment. If you wish to limit the information available to us, you should visit the privacy settings of your Third Party Accounts to learn about your options.

  *  **Information from other third parties.** We may collect information about you from other third parties, including demographic information, and combine this information with other information we collect about you.




 **Information we automatically collect:**

  *  **Web logs and usage information.** We record certain information and store it in log files when you interact with our Services. This information may include device and browser information, internet protocol (IP) address, URLs of referring/exit pages, and search terms.

  *  **Mobile device information.**

    * _In-store Wi-Fi._ When you connect to our in-store Wi-Fi, we receive information about you and your device, including your device’s MAC address, IP address, received signal strength indicator (RSSI), and technical details about your device such as its operating system, device type (including make and model), and technical capabilities. We will also receive information about how you use our Wi-Fi network while you are connected, including the store location, the areas of the store you visit, the names and/or Internet addresses of the websites you visit and the applications you use, and how long you interact with such sites or applications. If your mobile device is configured to search for available Wi-Fi networks, we may receive information about your device even if you choose not to connect to our Wi-Fi services.

    *  _Our Warby Parker App._ When you download and use our Warby Parker App, we receive information from your mobile device, such as IP address, device information, and unique device identifiers. We may also receive information about your precise location from your device, but only if you enable location tracking on your device. We may collect location data when your device is near our in-store systems, even if you are not currently using the app. You may turn off this location tracking at any time in your app settings or by disabling Bluetooth on your device.

    *  _Prescription Check App._ When you use the Prescription Check App, we may collect information about your mobile device, such as IP address, device information, and unique device identifiers, and we may derive your approximate location from your IP address. When you permit the Prescription Check App to access your location through your mobile device settings, we may collect the precise location of your device when the Prescription Check App is running in the foreground or background. Your location information is necessary to confirm your location while using the Prescription Check App, so we can be sure that your results are reviewed by an Eye Doctor licensed in your state.
  *  **Information from cookies and other technologies.** Like most websites, our Services may incorporate technology such as “pixel tags”, “web beacons”, and “cookies” that allow us and our service providers to collect information about your actions on our Services. Our service providers may collect information about your online activities over time and across different online services. Cookies (not to be confused with the sugary morsel) are small files that web servers may place on your computer when you visit a website. You may be able to set your web browser to reject cookies entirely or require that it request permission from you before accepting each new cookie. You can also delete cookies from your web browser once you leave a website.

  *  **Information from in-store technologies.** We may also collect information when you are visiting our stores. Like most retailers, we have in-store video surveillance for security, fraud, and loss prevention purposes. In addition, we analyze videos to help us understand customer behavior and retail traffic within our physical spaces. Our service providers may also collect information about your mobile device from other tracking technologies while you are near or in our stores to help us better understand our customers and how they use our Services.

## 5\. California Privacy Rights

If you are a California resident, in addition to awesome weather, you also have the ability to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal information, as defined by California Civil Code Section 1798.83, we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for their direct marketing purposes and the contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties (under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84).

## 6\. We are Committed to Protecting Your Information

We take the protection of your information very seriously. We understand the sensitivity of (for example) the prescription information you may give us. Therefore, we take many security measures (physical, electronic, and procedural) to help keep your information safe. For example, we limit access to authorized employees and third parties who are under an obligation to keep all such information confidential. Also, we only allow parties to access your identifiable information for permitted business purposes. Unfortunately, even though we use commercially reasonable efforts to protect your information, we cannot guarantee complete security. Any information that you provide to us is done so entirely at your own risk.

## 7\. Children’s Information

We are especially sensitive about children’s information. We do not knowingly allow individuals under the age of 18 to use Prescription Check and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13, in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor child, you may use our Services on behalf of such minor child.
