The  type of personal information we may collect could include, for example, your  name and postal address, date of birth, gender, telephone and fax numbers,  email address, and credit/debit card information; lifestyle and other  information collected on registration or through surveys.

This information may include the pages you browse and products and  services viewed or ordered for example.

For example we may send you information with  your bill, or you may simply receive an advertisement on your personal web and  WAP page according to any preferences indicated by you and/or according to your  interests. This helps us to make you aware of products and services that we may  have specially negotiated for our own customers and which may be of individual  interest to you.</p>

However, you can  contact us at anytime to have your details removed from lists used by us for  direct marketing purposes, to update your information or to otherwise tell us  how you would like to receive information about our and/or third party products  and services - the choice is yours. To update your marketing preferences please  email [insert email address] and quote your mobile and/or account number in the  body of the email and tell us what you want us to do (i.e. 'opt-out Email',  'opt-out SMS' etc or if you have previously objected to receiving information  by post for example, but would now like to change your mind and receive  information then just say, 'opt-in post' in the subject header of your email). <br>
