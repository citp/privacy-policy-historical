# Themis Media : Privacy Policy

This document describes the privacy practices for Themis Media ("Themis Media"). It makes it clear how Themis Media treats personal information that Themis Media collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Themis Media sites and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.

The websites maintained by Themis Media's affiliates and business partners post and administer their own privacy policies regarding the use of your information. Please read these policies carefully before taking advantage of their services. 

This policy makes clear that Themis Media could merge with or be acquired by another entity. Should this occur, you should expect that Themis Media would share some or all of your information with the other entity.

## How We Collect Information

Themis Media collects personal information when you visit Themis Media property pages or the pages of Themis Media partners, and when you submit user information to a Themis Media site or you use Themis Media products or services. Themis Media may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.

## Information We Collect Via Log Files and Cookies

While a user is on a Themis Media property, we automatically track certain information through log files and, on some pages, through cookies. This information includes a user's most recent visit, the URL they came from, the URL they visit next, the browser they are using, and their IP address.
