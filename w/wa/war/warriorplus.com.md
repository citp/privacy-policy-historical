We may allow some third-party advertisers ("third party" or "third parties") to collect and use personal information for many purposes including fulfilling WSO orders, or sending you to a third party page to view their offers. These advertisers may have a separate privacy policy to cover the use of this information on their separate websites which you are responsible for.
