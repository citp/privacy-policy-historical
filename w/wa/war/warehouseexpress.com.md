At Wex Photographic we use cookies to keep track of what you have in your basket, and to remember you when you return to our site. To place an order on this web site, you need to have cookies enabled. If you don't wish to enable cookies, you can browse the site but you may not be able to place an order.

Most web browsers have default settings which allow cookies to be stored. However under the "Managing your cookies" tab above, we set out information on how to disable or enable cookies should you wish to change your settings.

It should be noted that cookies cannot harm your computer. Furthermore, we do not store personally identifiable information such as credit card details in any cookies we create. We use encrypted information gathered from the cookies to help improve your experience of the site. For example, they help us to identify and resolve errors, or to determine relevant related products to show you when browsing our site.

We have relationships with carefully selected and monitored suppliers who may also set cookies during your visit to be used for marketing purposes. The principal purpose of such cookies is to show you different products and services based on what you appear to be interested in.
