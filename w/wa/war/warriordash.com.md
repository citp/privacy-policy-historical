**OUR PRIVACY POLICY**

Welcome to a website, domain or mobile application owned by Red Frog Events, its agents, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively, “RFE,” “we,” and/or “us”) that features RFE or one of our events or services. This Privacy Policy applies to our websites, domains, mobile applications (collectively, the “Services”). RFE makes the Services available for your use subject to all applicable terms and conditions contained in in our Terms of Service and in this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Terms”). The Terms may change from time to time and changes are effective upon posting, so it is your responsibility to check back and review the Terms.

Please read the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing or using the Services, including, without limitation, visiting our websites, registering for our events, signing up for contests or sweepstakes, participating in surveys, submitting comments or content, you expressly acknowledge that you have read and agree to be bound by the Terms and any applicable local laws. You waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of the Terms and the lack of signature by the parties. If you do not agree to the Terms, please stop using the Services immediately.

This Privacy Policy will help you understand what information we collect, how we use the information, how we share the information, and the choices you may have with respect to the information we collect. Please contact us at info@redfrogevents.com if you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy.

You may opt out of receiving our emails by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in any email you receive from us or by contacting us (see the “Contact Us” section at the end of this policy). Note, however, that if you opt out of receiving emails related to your current event registrations, you may miss important information or changes relating to the event, for which RFE assumes no responsibility.

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

We collect information from you in several different ways, including:

  1. **Information You Provide To Us Or Give Us Permission To Obtain**



We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you provide it to us voluntarily by creating an online account, commenting on a message board, registering for an event, signing up to receive our emails, contacting our customer service team, participating in a sweepstakes, contest or survey, donating to one of our charity partners, applying for a job or otherwise communicating with us.

You also may give us permission to access your information on third party social media sites. For example, you may link your Facebook or Twitter account to our websites, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (e.g., your friends or contacts). The information we obtain from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to keep those updated with your preferred settings.

The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, phone number, zip code, billing address, and any other information you choose to provide.

  2. **Information We Collect Automatically**



We automatically collect certain information when you access the Services or transact business with us, including:

  * **Transaction Information:** When you register for one of our events or services, we collect information about the transaction, such as contact information, registration details and the date and time of the registration.

Log Data we collect includes, but may not be limited to, Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses, browser type, characteristics of your device and software, domain names of your Internet Service Provider, your approximate geographic location, a record of your usage of the Services, the time of your usage, the referring link through which you accessed the Services and aggregated personal data that cannot be used to specifically identify you.


  * **Device Data:** In addition to Log Data, we may also collect information about the device you use to access our sites (“Device Data”), including what type of device it is, what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identifiers and crash data.

For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you are using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please consult the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.
