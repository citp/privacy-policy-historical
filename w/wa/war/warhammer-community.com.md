We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.

#### 6 How secure is your information?

We have put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used, accessed, altered or disclosed.

#### 8 Do you transfer my information outside of the European Union?

We may transfer your personal information outside the European Economic Area (EEA). For example, our Websites are hosted on servers within Europe and the United States of America, and our third party service providers operate around the world.  We will only transfer your personal information outside the EEA if adequate protection measures are in place.  To ensure that your personal information does receive an adequate level of protection outside the EEA we use the following protection measures:

  * Transferring to countries approved by the European Commission
  * Using model contractual clauses approved by the European Commission
  * Requiring companies we transfer information to in the United States to be signed up to the EU/US Privacy Shield Framework



Further details in respect of protective measures used outside of the EEA are available on request. Please contact us (section 13) for further information.

#### 9 How long do we keep hold of your information?

We only retain your information for as long as necessary for the purposes described above, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which it has been processed, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you.

#### 10 What are your rights in connection with your personal information?

Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:

  * Request access to a copy of the personal information we hold about you
  * Request correction of any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you
  * Request erasure of information where there is no good reason for continued processing
  * Object to processing of your information where we are relying on a legitimate interest to process your information.
  * Where we are processing your information for a particular purpose based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
  * Request restriction to suspend our processing of your personal information.
  * Request transfer of your personal information to another party which you have provided to us.
  * Opt out of marketing communications which we send you at any time.



If you want to exercise any of these rights please contact us (section 13).

You will not have to pay a fee to exercise any of your rights, however we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.

Please note that we may need to request information from you to confirm your identity and establish your entitlement to these rights.

If you are not satisfied with our processing of your personal information, you also have the right to make a complaint to the relevant supervisory authority. Please see [here](http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=612080) for the relevant contact details.
