**EU Cookie Policy**

This site, like many others, uses small files called cookies to help customise your experience for a number of reasons and we presume “implied consent” if users visit the Warlord Games website and continue to use it after being informed about the cookies in operation outlined in our [cookie information page](http://www.warlordgames.com/home/cookie-information/):

Session cookies – allow websites to link the actions of a user during a browser session. They may be used for a variety of purposes such as remembering what a user has put in their shopping basket as they browse around a site. These session cookies expire after a browser session so would not be stored longer term. For this reason session cookies may sometimes be considered less privacy intrusive than persistent cookies.

For us these cookies are essential for the running of our websites. Without the use of these cookies parts of our websites would not function.

Persistent cookies – are stored on a users’ device in between browser sessions which allows the preferences or actions of the user across a site (or in some cases across different websites) to be remembered. Persistent cookies may be used for a variety of purposes including remembering users’ preferences.

We use functional cookies to remember your preferences on our websites. This is usually in conjunction with our webstore and forum.

First and third party cookies – Whether a cookie is ‘first’ or ‘third’ party refers to the website or domain placing the cookie. First party cookies in basic terms are cookies set by a website visited by the user – the website displayed in the URL window. Third party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than the one being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and a separate company sets a cookie through that website this would be a third party cookie.

We use these types of cookies to monitor our websites performance and how our users may use it. These cookies provide us with information that helps us provide a better product and also to identify any areas that may need maintenance.
