As such, we have established and implemented this Privacy Policy to inform visitors to the Site and users of the War is Boring Features how we use and protect the information we collect through the Site and/or the War is Boring Features.

This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date set forth above and is only applicable to the Site and the War is Boring Features and not to any other website or mobile application that you may be able to access from the Site or the War is Boring Features which may have its own data collection and use practices and policies.

  * What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personal information?
  * What security measures do we take to safeguard your personal information?



**_What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?_**  


**Types of Information We Collect**

Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you. You do not need to submit personal information to access the War is Boring Features generally. However, you may be required to submit personal information to access certain aspects of the Site and the War is Boring Features. We may collect non-personal information such as your browser type, when you accessed the Site and from what physical location you accessed the Site (including your Internet Protocol (IP) address).  However, to the extent that your IP addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.  This non-personal information may be aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views, and other statistics about users of the Site. We also may use this data to monitor the Site’s performance and to make the Site easier and more convenient to use.

We collect personal information when you subscribe to our newsletter; participate in feedback forms or surveys; post comments on the Site; or receive customer or technical support.

If you wish receive communications about new products, services, features, or enhancements to the War is Boring Features that may be of interest to you, we require you to provide your email address. To post comments on the Site, we require you to provide certain information, including your name, screen name and email address. Providing additional information beyond what is required, such as your photo or website URL, is entirely optional, but enables you to gain more from the War is Boring Features. By submitting personal information through the Site, you authorize War is Boring to share this personal information for the purposes identified herein and on the Site, such as responding to user inquiries processing transactions, distributing materials, and requesting feedback.

**Third Party Privacy Policies**

Through the War is Boring Features, you may be able to link to technology, software and services owned and controlled by third parties (“ ** _Third Party Features_** ”). You may be permitted or required to submit personal information to access Third Party Features. Such use of Third Party Features and submission of information through Third Party Features will be subject to such applicable third party’s Terms of Use/Service and Privacy Policy. You agree to look solely to the applicable third party and not to War is Boring to enforce your rights in relation thereto. When you have clicked on a third party logo or URL displayed on the Site or accessible through the War is Boring Features, which links you to any Third Party Features, our Terms of Use no longer applies and you must read the Terms of Use/Service and Privacy Policy of the third party to see how your personal information will be handled on their website.

**How We Use Your Personal Information**

The personal information you provide to us will allow us to communicate with you and provide the War is Boring Features to you, depending on the War is Boring Features for which you register. This includes alerting you of new services, features, or enhancements to the War is Boring Features; verifying your identity; handling your customer service questions or issues; requesting feedback; distributing newsletters; and notifying you of promotions, updates, or special offers that we think may interest you.

We may use your personal information with non-personal information that we have collected in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the War is Boring Features. We may make your personal information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable. This process is known as de-personalizing your information. You grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your personal information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect in providing the War is Boring Features (the “ ** _Analytical Data_** ”). We are expressly authorized to make any commercial use of the Analytical Data, including without limitation, sharing the Analytical Data with third parties, provided that we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer from us any part of the Analytical Data that personally identifies any War is Boring Features users
