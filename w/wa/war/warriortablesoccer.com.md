# Privacy Policy - Warrior Custom Golf

We at Warrior Table Soccer have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. Our information gathering and dissemination practices for this site are as follows:

Personal Information & Its Use

Warrior Table Soccer uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to deliver content specific to your interests. Our site’s registration form requires users to give us contact information (their e-mail address), unique identifiers (name and/or password), financial information (customer account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (zip code, age, or income level). The customer’s contact information may also be used by us to contact the visitor.

Anyone who changes their mind about receiving our newsletter may opt out of receiving future mailings.

Financial information that we collect is used to bill customers for products and services, as well as check the Warrior Table Soccer partners’ qualifications for registration. Unique identifiers (such as Social Security numbers or tax ID numbers) are collected to be used only in the reporting of income tax when the Warrior Table Soccer partner may have received in excess of $600.00 during a fiscal year (this amount is subject to change by the federal government of the United States). This information may differ for residents of other nations. Demographic and profile data may also be collected by our site. We use this data to tailor our visitors’ experience at our site by showing them content that we think they might be interested in and displaying the content according to their preferences. This is designed to enhance the shopping experience.

Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitors’ contact information (e-mail address) and financial information (account or credit card numbers). We may also collect demographic information (zip code, age, or income level).

At times, Warrior Table Soccer may conduct user surveys. When we do, we gather that information in order to help evolve our business model. We may share or sell that information with business partners. We may, at times, use the demographic information we gathered as a marketing or promotional tool. From time to time, Warrior Table Soccer may run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (e-mail addresses) and demographic information (zip code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our contests to send users information about our Warrior Table Soccer and promotional material from some of our partners. The customer’s contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. If they wish, users may opt-out of receiving future mailings.

Warrior Table Soccer also allows any customer to create a Warrior Table Soccer customer account. This allows the user to simplify his or her purchase process at any Warrior Table Soccer site. All the information that a customer supplies during account creation will be held in the strictest confidence. It will be used to manage the payment and shipping of orders. Warrior Table Soccer does not share any private financial information about its customers with any outside company or agency unless required by law. We may share other information with marketing partners.

We use the information you provide about yourself or others to complete the transaction for which the information is intended. Such transactions may include: administering a service such as e-mail, search, community, advertising sales, e-commerce, completing an order, shipping a product, replying to support requests, or contacting you if you have granted us permission to do so. Except as provided in this privacy policy and the end-user agreement, we do not share this information with outside parties without your permission, except to the extent that is necessary to administer the services we offer our clients and end-users or to comply in responding to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal proceedings.

From time to time, we also use the information you provide about yourself or others to inform you of additions or improvements to the Warrior Table Soccer services, as well as conduct member surveys in order to improve our services in the form of various communication platforms including, but not limited to email, phone, and text messages.

Through our Everyone Benefits program, customers can receive information about third party services that are likely to be of interest. Users of our free service will initially be opted in to this program, while customers signing up for any of our paid services can choose to opt in. Customers can opt out of our Everyone Benefits program by clicking on the link provided in the e-mail or by visiting our site and opting out.We may also use personally identifiable end-user information to provide targeted content and commerce opportunities to end-users based on their demographic and behavioral information.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways or for reasons unrelated to the ones described above without also providing an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
