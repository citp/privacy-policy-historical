Last Update: October 24, 2019

This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes how the Wasabi group of companies (for more details, see “Contact Information” below) (“Wasabi,” “we,” “our” or “us”) collect, use, and share information in connection with your use of our websites (the “Sites”), as well as any products, services, and/or applications available on or through the Sites (collectively, the “Services”). However, this Policy does not apply to information customers or users (“users”, “you,” or “your”) may process when using our Services. 

The information we collect includes “personal data,” which is any information about an identifiable individual, as further set forth in this Policy. Wasabi is the sole owner of the information collected on the Sites or through your use of the Services. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this Policy. 

Further, Wasabi respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data in line with the General Data Protection Regulation – Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”). This Policy will inform you as to how we will look after your personal data when you interact with us, including visiting our Sites. It also tells you about your rights in relation to your personal data. 

We recommend that you read this Policy in full to ensure you are fully informed regarding our privacy practices. If you have any questions about this Policy or Wasabi’s data collection, use, and disclosure practices, please contact us at [privacy@wasabi.com](mailto:privacy@wasabi.com).

You can use some of the features of the Sites or Services without registering, thereby limiting the type of information that we collect.

If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you such as your name, email address, phone number, the contents of the message and/or attachments you may send us, and any other information you may choose to provide.

  * We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. 
  * Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. 
  * Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. 



Please contact us <https://wasabi.com/legal/privacy-policy/#contact> if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA. 

**I. Your Rights** – Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. We have explained your rights below; if you wish to exercise any of your rights, please contact us at [privacy@wasabi.com](mailto:privacy@wasabi.com). We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. You have the right to: 

• access, correct, update, or request deletion of your personal information (note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request). 

• object to the processing of your personal information. You may ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information, or request portability of your personal information (however, in some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms). 

• request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. 

• request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. 

• opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing emails we send you. 

• withdraw your consent at any time for any personal data we have collected and processed with your consent. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. 

• complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. 

**No Fee Usually Required**

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. 

**What We May Need From You**

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. 

**J. Children’s Privacy** – The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act restricts the collection and use of personal data pertaining to children under the age of 13. We do not allow such children to register as users and will not knowingly collect or solicit personal data from anyone under the age of 13. No one under the age of 13 should provide any personal data on or through the Sites or otherwise.
