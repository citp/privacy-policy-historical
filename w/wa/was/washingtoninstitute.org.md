The information we gather and receive from our customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at the Bookstore. We receive and store certain information you enter on our website or provide to us in other ways. We use this information for purposes such as processing and fulfilling your orders, communicating with you and improving the Bookstore. 

**COOKIES  
**  
Like many websites, we use �cookies� to keep track of the items you've added to your cart as you're shopping. Cookies are small text files written into the browser�s memory or hard drive for this specific purpose. Each server can only read the files it left behind in a particular browser. The information stored in the cookies does not reveal any detail about your store access, purchase, or any other customer information.

You can examine and delete the cookie files on your computer at any time. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. 

**PERSONAL INFORMATION AND PRIVACY  
**  
Financial Information.�Your personal financial information and credit card details are never revealed to any third party except our bank and yours to the extent necessary to process and complete your transaction. 

E-Mail Addresses.�We collect email addresses when a customer purchases a book from us online only to facilitate orders. We don�t sell, trade, or share email addresses with third parties. 

Other Personal Information.�In connection with processing your order, we may collect other personal information about you, such as your address. For example, when a customer purchases a book from us, his or her name and street address are stored in our order processing system, and the customer may receive follow-up mailings from us with information on their order.

Children.�We do not sell products to children. Accordingly, we do not collect information about children. 

Legal Compliance and Fraud Prevention.�We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or to enforce our terms of use. We may also exchange information with other organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

**TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT

**SECURITY**

Orders placed in this online bookstore are secured using the standard Web encryption technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The personal information you provide and your credit card information are transmitted in encrypted form, never in clear text. This ensures that any information traveling between your browser and the web server is protected from being read by those who might attempt to intercept the transmission. The identity of our Bookstore site is vouched for by digital certificates issued by Pair Networks.

**SAFEGUARDING YOUR PRIVACY

Keep all information stored in a safe place, do not provide your personal information to anyone else, and be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
