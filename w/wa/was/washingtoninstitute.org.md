# Donor Privacy Policy - The Washington Institute for Near East Policy

  
This site is owned and operated by The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. The Institute holds the privacy of its users and donors in the utmost respect. Because we gather certain types of personal information, we feel you should have full access to the terms and conditions surrounding its capture and use, which is disclosed by this privacy statement.

We collect personal data through our email subscription, event registration, and online donation services. We only collect this information when users submit it voluntarily. If a user prefers not to submit such information online, they may contact The Washington Institute to determine an appropriate offline channel to transmit this information.

**Under no circumstances does The Washington Institute divulge—sell, trade, or share—any information about an individual user or donor to a third party or send donor mailings on behalf of other organizations.**

From these services, we may collect your first name, last name, and email address, company, position, secondary email address, address, city, state, zip code, and phone numbers (home, work, or mobile). We may collect event-specific information pertaining to your attendance, meal preferences, and guests. We may collect the name and email of a spouse, contributor, or foundation that you provide to receive recognition for a gift. When you contribute online, we ask that you verify your status as a U.S. citizen or representative of a U.S. entity to ensure that the Institute’s fundraising practices support our dedication to promoting American interests.

All the above information is collected to help us tailor our content and personalize your experience. We may use this information to send you Institute emails or mailings, updates on our programs, and scholar activities. You may opt-out of these communications at any time.

If you submit payment for an event through [Cvent ](http://cvent.com/)(our online event registration software) or donate online using the form powered by [Wufoo](http://wufoo.com/) (online form builder), we also collect payment information, credit card numbers, and billing addresses. This information is collected to process your payment and is not stored by the Institute.

The Washington Institute does not knowingly collect information from children. If we request this information in the future, we will notify you in advance, and you may provide this information only if you so elect to do so.

See our Web Privacy and Use Policy for details on information collected during web browsing and site terms of use.
