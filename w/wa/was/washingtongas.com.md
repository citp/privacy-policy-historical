# Privacy Policy - Washington Gas

_Last Updated (11/20/2015)_

At Washington Gas, we respect your concerns about privacy. 

This document sets forth our Privacy Policy ("Policy") regarding information we may collect when you visit our washingtongas.com website (“Site”). The Policy will help you understand how we may collect, use and share the information we collect and the choices that may be available to you. As described more fully below, the amount and type of information we collect will depend upon how you use the Site.

## Information We May Collect

_**Information that you provide us:**_

You can access a range of information on washingtongas.com without having to provide us with information about yourself. For example, you can read product, company, employment and investor information without providing personal information. However, for some services, we may request information.

For example, if you choose to register at the Washington Gas eService Center, we will request your name, email address, password and security question. If you elect to pay your gas bill electronically using your personal checking account, we will ask for your routing transit number and account number. We may also collect information when you use the Contact Us feature of the Site. Other information we may request includes, but may not be limited to, your street address, phone number and Washington Gas account number.

Please note that Washington Gas will NOT retain your banking account information, unless you choose to have Washington Gas retain this information. Electing to have Washington Gas save your banking information allows you to avoid providing this information each time you pay your bill electronically. If you opt to NOT have your banking account information stored, you may have to provide this information each time that you pay your bill online.

##  Cookies and Monitoring of Web Traffic 

Cookies are bits of electronic information a website can transfer to your computer's hard drive. Web beacons - also called web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFS - are small files that collect information about website usage. Cookies and web beacons help us recognize a visitor as a repeat visitor and to retrieve information the visitor previously submitted so it does not have to be resubmitted. Cookies and web beacons can also help websites customize content and learn how visitors interact with the website or email communications. Washington Gas may use cookies and web beacons.

If you would like, you can disable your cookies on your Internet browser and continue to use the Site. Each browser is different, so you should check your browser’s “Help” menu or other resources to learn how to change your cookie preferences. Rejecting or blocking cookies may impact how information is presented to you on the Site.

We do not currently respond to web browser “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information across the networks of websites and online services in which we participate. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this privacy policy.
