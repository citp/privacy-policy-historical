 _How We Process Personal Data for Commercial Purposes_  
We and certain third parties process Personal Data we hold for certain purposes, depending on the context of collection and your rights and choices, including:

 **Personalization & Consumer Profiles**  
In order to understand our customers’ preferences, and better recommend content and Services that are personalized to our customers, we may create a “ **Consumer Profile** ” by linking together and analyzing Personal Data collected in the following contexts:

  * When you make a purchase or other transaction through our Services
  * When you access or use our Digital Services
  * Cookies and other tracking technologies
  * When you enter a contest or other promotion

We may also augment Consumer Profiles with Personal Data that we create (such as Inference Data) or that we receive from our affiliated companies or third parties, and may include Personal Data such as information about Services you have used or purchased previously, and demographic data. 

We use Consumer Profiles for our legitimate interests in market research and statistical analysis in connection with the improvement of our Services. For example, we may analyze the Personal Data of people who have subscribed to our Publications in the past, and compare them with other people in our database. If we identify people in the database who have similar Personal Data to the subscribers, we may then target marketing to the new people we have identified in our database, for example by sending marketing emails. We may conduct the profiling and send the direct marketing emails automatically. We may also use this information for other Commercial Purposes. 

**Marketing Communications**  
Consistent with our legitimate business interests, we (or if appropriate, our third-party partners) may send you marketing and promotional communications if you sign up for such communications or purchase products or services from us. Where allowed, we may also send you these communications if you register for our Services or for a promotion, or in connection with your communications with or submission of User Content to us. These communications may be personalized or customized based on your user profile. 

Similarly, we may also collect Device/Network Data and Contact Data so that we can determine whether you have opened an email or otherwise interacted with our communications, and we may generate Inference Data based on these interactions.

We may also process this Personal Data for targeted advertising. However, where consent to processing is required by law, we will link and process this information for targeted advertising with appropriate consent.

 **Targeted Advertising**  
We, and certain third parties operating on or through our Services, may engage in targeted advertising. This form of advertising includes various parties and services providers, including third party data controllers, engaged in the processing of Personal Data in connection with advertising. These parties may be able to identify you across sites, devices, and over time. 

The parties that control the processing of Personal Data for behavioral advertising purposes may create or leverage information derived from personalization and profiling. In some cases, these parties may also develop and assess aspects of a profile about you to determine whether you are a type of person a company wants to advertise to, and determine whether and how ads you see are effective. These third parties may augment your profile with demographic and other Inference Data derived from these observations, and may also track whether you view, interact with, or how often you have seen an ad, or whether you complete a purchase for a good or services you were shown in an advertisement. 

We generally use targeted advertising for the purpose of marketing our Services and third-party goods and services, to send marketing communications, including by creating custom marketing audiences on third-party websites (such as Facebook).

 **Data Sales**  
Certain Commercial Processing purposes involve “sales” of data as defined by applicable law. For example, we may “sell” (as defined by applicable law) certain Personal Data when we engage in marketing campaigns with or on behalf of sponsors, when we conduct targeted advertising, or we may sell or grant access to Personal Data to our marketing partners, promoters, and other advertisers. See the California Rights & Disclosures section for a list of categories of Personal Data sold.
