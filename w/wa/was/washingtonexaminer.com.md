Subject to your consent where required by law, we, and certain third parties operating on or through our Digital Services, may engage in online behavioral advertising.

These services may also track whether you view, interact with, or how often you have seen an ad, or whether or not you complete a purchase for goods or services you were shown in an advertisement. These tracking technologies may also be used to help limit the number of times you see the same ads, or help determine whether you have interacted with or viewed ads delivered to you.

Processing of this data takes place on our Digital Services, on third-party websites that participate in ad networks, and through other services providers. Third party companies, for example social media companies, may also collect this information via third-party social media cookies, or when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on our Digital Services or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook or Twitter.
