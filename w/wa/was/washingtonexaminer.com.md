# Washington Examiner Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to information about you collected through [WashingtonExaminer.com](http://washingtonexaminer.com/) (the “Site”). This Privacy Policy is part of and incorporated into the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms) for our Site, and any capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy which are not defined here will have the same definitions as set forth in our [Terms of Use.](https://web.archive.org/terms)

#### Types of Information

We collect two types of information through our Site. “PII” means “personally identifiable information,” which is information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us (including without limitation your name, email address, mailing address, or other personal information). “Non-PII” means “non-personally identifiable information” or information which alone does not identify you (however, in some circumstances Non-PII may be combined with PII in order to identify a specific individual). 

#### Your Consent to This Privacy Policy

By using our Site, you are agreeing to the collection, use, and disclosure of your PII and Non-PII as described in this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please email us at [privacy@washingtonexaminer.com](mailto:privacy@washingtonexaminer.com).

#### Information We Gather and Track

In order to access or use certain features of our Site, you may be required to voluntarily register and submit certain PII through our Site. The use of these features is purely optional, so you are not required to submit any PII to us if you do not wish to do so. For example, you may wish to provide PII to comment on articles, subscribe to our online newsletters, or submit feedback to us. This information may include your name, email address, and other information you voluntarily provide. We also collect Non-PII through our Site. The Non-PII collected does not by itself identify you personally. Non-PII collected through our Site includes: information sent to us automatically by your web browser such as the web page you were visiting when you accessed our Site, the operating system and browser you are using, the date and time of your visit, user traffic patterns and content accessed throughout our Site, and other data. This information allows us to better tailor our Content to our readers' needs, to improve our Site, and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand our audience. We may also allow certain advertising networks or third party service providers (for example, companies providing data services on our Site) to track Non-PII of users who visit our Site. 

#### How Information is Gathered

In order to improve your experience when using our Site, we, our third party service providers or advertisers may place a file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer, or may also use “web beacons,” “pixel tags” or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor behavior and collect certain data regarding the actions of our users online. These cookies and other technologies may be used to track user traffic patterns, to enhance your experience when using our Site, to persist information through your session, to target advertising or content to you as described further below, and to collect Non-PII about you and your visit to our Site for other marketing and business purposes. You can adjust your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser. Disabling cookies may result in a less complete experience while using the Site.

#### Third Party Advertising; Targeting of Ads and Content

We use third party companies to serve ads on our Site, to provide us with data collection, ad response measurement, ad or content targeting, and other marketing or related services. We may grant permission to these companies and certain advertisers or customers of these companies to use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags or similar technologies in order to collect Non-PII about our users (subject to their own privacy guidelines) for purposes of generating advertisements and other content targeted to your interests, and for other data collection, response measurement, marketing and related business purposes. 

The Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), a cooperative group of ad serving providers that has developed a set of privacy principles to which its members adhere, provides a website offering more information about behavioral advertising practices and your choices about not having certain Non-PII used by certain companies in order to target advertisements to you, as well as information about NAI and third party ad servers in general. You may visit the NAI site at [www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp). 

#### Use of Information

Washington Examiner or our third party service providers may use PII or Non-PII collected on our Site:

  * To enhance or personalize your experience using our Site; 
  * To process or maintain your registration on the Site;
  * To provide information or services you have requested
  * To inform you of offers or new features that we believe may be of interest to you;
  * To facilitate advertisements or sponsorships on our Site;
  * In connection with various programs or promotions in which you choose to participate;
  * For targeting of advertising or content, or other advertising or marketing purposes;
  * To study the use and popularity of various areas of our Site and to improve our Site;
  * To analyze where we are getting our audience (by reviewing IP addresses);
  * For other purposes related to our business, and for any other purpose described in this Privacy Policy or any other agreement you may enter with WashingtonExaminer.com, or otherwise as we may disclose to you or to which you consent from time to time.



We may create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their interests. We will not intentionally collect (nor intentionally provide to an advertiser or sponsor) information that a personally-identified user clicked on any particular ad. However, by clicking on, otherwise interacting with or viewing an ad, you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad, and this may lead to similar ads being targeted to you on our Site and potentially on other Sites.

#### Sharing of Information

We may share your PII with: (i) our current or future affiliates, subsidiaries, parent company, or other related entities ("Related Entities"); (ii) companies and organizations that perform services on our behalf (such as data storage, web hosting, or other services); and (iii) carefully selected third parties for purposes relating to Washington Examiner or third party services or promotions we believe would be of interest to you, marketing activities, ad targeting as described herein, or other purposes relevant to the business of Washington Examiner or our Related Entities. 

We may also disclose the PII and Non-PII we collect through our Site when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law or legal process (including a court order or subpoena); to prevent or investigate a possible crime; to enforce the WashingtonExaminer.com [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms); to respond to your customer service requests; and to protect the rights, property or safety of Washington Examiner, our users or others. 

We may share analyses of our server logs, including details regarding Site usage and general information about our audience, with current or potential advertisers or business partners. Such disclosures will refer only to general, aggregate usage data from these analyses - never specific identifying information.

Information submitted to our Site is an asset of Washington Examiner and will become part of our normal business records. Your PII may be transferred to another company that acquires the stock or assets of Washington Examiner, for example, as the result of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation. If such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company's use of your PII will still be subject to this Privacy Policy, and any privacy choices you selected in your online profile on our Site.

Please be aware that although we may request your consent for some disclosures described in this section, by using our Site you are deemed to have accepted and agreed to the sharing of your information collected through our Site in the manner described in this Privacy Policy, and we will not be required to obtain your consent for any disclosures described in this Privacy Policy. 

#### User Comments and Other PII Posted by You

If you choose to register and post comments on our Site, please be aware that any PII (including photos) you post on our Site or make available via logging in with your other social media accounts (within your profile, comments, or otherwise), will automatically be visible to the general public, and will potentially remain on the Site indefinitely. To the extent you have posted PII in your public user profile, in articles or comments on the Site, or otherwise in a publicly displayed manner on our Site, that information is available to the general public and can be used in connection with distribution and promotion of such content to third parties, for news reporting related to the article or comment in which the PII is located on our Site, or for other similar purposes, due to the fact that the information became public when you posted it on our Site. If you register on our Site using a third party social media account, the comments you post on our Site (and any responses to those comments) may automatically be posted to the applicable third party social media sites in addition to our Site, and any such comments will be subject to those social media websites’ policies.

#### Third Party Websites

Third party websites, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers featured on our Site or accessible through links on our Site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. You may encounter these third party sites through links in our articles, third party content widgets or excerpts on our Site, advertisements, features, or promotions featured on or accessible via links from our Site. We do not have any control over these third parties’ use of the information you may provide to them. Washington Examiner is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties and is not liable to you for any claims that may arise from your interaction with those third parties or their sites. You should exercise caution and check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing PII or another party’s information on a feature or page operated by a third party.

#### International Users – Transfer of Information

Washington Examiner is headquartered in the United States, and you understand that any PII collected on the Site will be transferred to Washington Examiner (or its third party partners depending on which element of the Site collected the data) in the United States and may be shared with Examiner Entities and third parties elsewhere as described herein. You hereby consent to the transfer to and processing of any PII by Washington Examiner and any Examiner Entities, any of their future owners, or any of the other parties listed in the above section "Sharing of Information," whether located in the United States or any other countries, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or for any other specific purposes to which you consent. If you are located in a country other than the United States, you should note that, at present, the laws of the United States and certain other countries have not been approved by the European Commission or privacy authorities in certain other countries as providing "adequate protection" for personal information within the meaning of the EU Data Protection Directive or applicable laws of other countries. Please know, however, that no matter where your personal information is collected, used, transferred or stored, if it was collected through the Site, it will be protected by the terms of this Privacy Policy. YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO THE USE AND PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IN THE UNITED STATES OR IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE MANNER SET FORTH HEREIN. 

#### Children's Privacy

Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we will never knowingly request or collect PII from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent. The Site is not directed at nor targeted to children under the age of 13 and we do not use the Site to knowingly solicit PII from or market to children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, do not provide us with any PII. If we learn that someone under 13 has provided PII to the Site, we will use reasonable efforts to remove such information from our databases.

#### How We Protect Information

Washington Examiner protects data provided by users to the extent we believe necessary based on the information provided. Only authorized individuals have access to the PII provided by our Site’s users.

We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use and disclose your PII. If you have registered on our Site in any manner, you may update or modify your information or change your preferences at any time by contacting us through the Contact Us form on our Site.
