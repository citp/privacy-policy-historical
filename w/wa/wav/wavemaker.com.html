<span class="title">PRIVACY POLICY</span>
<hr>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the Internet's vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete confidence.</p>

<p>We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how Aspect1, Inc. collects information from all end users of Aspect1's Internet services (the "Services") - those who access some of our Services but do not have accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service ("Members") - what we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and use of such information. Aspect1, Inc. requests that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.</p>

<p>It is Aspect1's policy not to use or share the personal information about Visitors of Members in ways unrelated to the ones described below without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, Aspect1, Inc. may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, or information regarding your use of the Services or web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect Aspect1, Inc. and our Members.</p>

<p>While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information.</p>

<p><strong>"Cookies" and How Aspect1 Uses Them</strong><br>
A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain web sites. Aspect1, Inc may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the products and services we provide and to manage our telecommunications networks. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your customer information. Additionally, be aware that if you visit non-Aspect1 web sites where you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable, you may be required to accept cookies.
Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them.</p>

<p><strong>Email </strong><br>
We do not release, rent, or sell any email addresses of customers or prospects to any entity outside Aspect1, Inc.  At marketing events, we assume that people providing their email addresses are opting in to receive email messages from us. Therefore, we do not include an email opt-out option when collecting event leads.</p>
 
<p><strong>Registration Forms </strong><br>
This site may ask you to complete a registration form if you choose to obtain additional information on our products, technology, and services. Therefore, these forms may require that you include various types of contact information. We do no distribute this contact information to any parties outside Aspect1, Inc. </p>

<p><strong>Disclosure</strong><br>
Aspect1 will not sell, trade, or disclose to third parties any customer identifiable information derived from the registration for or use of an Aspect1, Inc. online service -- including customer names and addresses -- without the consent of the customer (except as required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process or in the case of imminent physical harm to the customer or others). When Aspect1, Inc. uses other agents, contractors or companies to perform services on its behalf, Aspect1, Inc. will ensure that the company protects your customer identifiable information consistent with this Policy. If Aspect1, Inc. includes your name and any other customer identifiable information in a directory that is created from information we receive as an online service provider, we will give you the opportunity to have your information excluded from that directory. Business directories that Aspect1, Inc. creates may, however, contain information obtained from other sources.</p> 

<p><strong>How Do We Protect Information We Collect?</strong> <br>
We offer secure web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and we store certain kinds of data in encrypted form. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our Site reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. </p>

<p><strong>External Links </strong><br>
Aspect1, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy policies or contents of any external web sites accessed by links on our site.</p>

<p><strong>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</strong><br>
Protecting children's privacy is especially important to us. It is our policy to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and all other applicable laws.
We believe that there is no substitute for proper parental supervision. Aspect1, Inc. recommends that children ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to Aspect1, Inc. or to anyone else online.</p>

<p><strong>How to Access or Modify Your Information</strong><br>
Aspect1, Inc. offers Members the opportunity to access or modify information provided during registration. To access or modify such information: www.aspect1.net and click "My Account" or contact our Customer Service Department at 800-800-6613.</p>
