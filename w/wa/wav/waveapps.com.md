# Wave • Privacy Policy

Effective as of: February 20, 2018

At Wave Financial Inc. (“Wave”), we value your trust and respect your privacy. 

Wave exists to support entrepreneurs like you by offering a fast and easy way to manage your money, while respecting your privacy expectations. 

##  Scope 

This privacy policy applies to waveapps.com and, its subdomains (the “Site”), and our mobile apps, all of which are owned and operated by Wave Financial Inc. It does not apply to any third-party websites, which have their own policies. Throughout this policy, when we say Wave, we mean our company, including the Site and any Wave mobile apps, and when we say Services we mean the various financial products and services, and apps we make available to you through our Site and mobile apps, including our payments, payroll, accounting, invoicing services, and other small business–related services and support. 

By “Personal Information”, we mean information about an identifiable individual. That’s what this policy is about – our collection, protection, use, retention, disclosure and other processing of Personal Information and your rights relating to these activities. We also compile certain aggregate data about our users. 

What is aggregate data? “Tim Smith buys a coffee at a coffee shop on Main Street” is the Personal Information of Tim Smith, but “20% of Wave users buy coffee on Tuesdays” is aggregate data. 

We use Personal Information in order to provide you and your business with the Services. Our Privacy Policy is based on the following 10 fair information principles: 

  1. Accountability
  2. Identifying purposes
  3. Consent
  4. Limiting collection
  5. Limiting use, disclosure, and retention
  6. Accuracy
  7. Safeguards
  8. Openness
  9. Individual access
  10. Challenging compliance



##  Accountability and Challenging Compliance (#1 and #10) 

Wave has named a Privacy Officer who is responsible for all things privacy at Wave. This includes our policies and procedures that are designed to keep your information safe. If you have any questions about our privacy practices or this policy, you can contact me at:

##  Identifying Purposes (#2) 

Wave collects, uses, discloses, and otherwise manages Personal Information in a variety of ways related to the Services we provide. We’ve outlined these below. Your use of the Services determines which information we collect and use. For example, payroll information is optional, unless you’d like to use Payroll by Wave to run payrolls, at which point we will need to collect payroll information in order to provide you with this service. Similarly, when you create an invoice, your customer’s email is optional, but if you’d like to us to deliver the invoice by email, this information becomes necessary. 

Wave may collect, use, store, or disclose your Personal Information for the purposes described below. 

  * In order to provide you with the Services, which includes the following: 
    * We collect information directly from you, but may also collect information from third parties when you connect your Wave account to them. These integrations may pull data into or share data out of Wave. In some cases, we use a service provider to connect you to a third-party service ( _e.g._. when you connect to your bank account to pull in transactions). 
    * We may also collect your name and email address from third parties when you sign up and login to our Site using single sign-on (SSO). 
    * When you connect your Wave account with a third-party service, their terms and policies apply. 
  * To promote or offer you products or services, and to determine your eligibility for new services we may offer from time to time. 
  * To provide you with educational materials and guides relevant to the Services you use. 
  * To contact you for the purposes of Service updates and system and account notifications. 
  * To provide you with support in connection with the Services. 
  * To comply with any laws, regulation, court orders, warrants, inquiries, subpoenas or other legal processes or investigations, and to protect ourselves, other individuals, or property from harm. 
  * In connection with a prospective or completed merger or sale (including insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings) involving all or part of Wave or as part of a corporate reorganization or stock sale or other change in corporate control. 



**We will never sell your Personal Information to other companies.**

##  Consent (#3) 

Wave takes a consent-based approach to the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information. 

###  Submitting the Personal Information of others 

When you submit the Personal Information of your customers or employees to us, you are responsible for informing such customers and employees about Wave, and for obtaining any necessary consent or authority from them. 

You may also choose to refer someone to our Site. We will send them a single invitation email to the address you provide. Please ensure that you only submit email addresses of individuals or businesses with whom you have a relationship and who would want to receive the message. 

###  Closing your Wave account 

At any time and without penalty, Wave users can withdraw their consent to the continued use or disclosure of their Personal Information by closing their Wave account. Please ensure you complete the account closure process which includes a confirmation email. Otherwise, your account may not be closed. 

###  Email and communications consent 

At any time, you can opt-out of commercial email communications from us by clicking on the unsubscribe link in such emails, or via the Email Preferences settings in your account. Certain non-commercial communications may still be sent to you that are required to provide you with our Services. For example, system notifications, major product changes, changes to our Terms of Use, or other news that we believe will materially affect how you interact with Wave. 

The only way to completely stop all emails from Wave is to close your account as outlined above. 

##  Limiting Collection (#4) 

Wave only collects the Personal Information necessary to provide the Services to you. The Services you use will determine which information Wave collects. We’ll also provide you the option of sharing additional information to enhance your Wave experience. 

Wave may also use third-party services to supplement or enrich our understanding of our customers. This includes cross-referencing information like a name, business name, email address or IP address in third-party databases, and using the information there to improve our understanding of you and your business. 

Wave is not intended for children and we do not knowingly or intentionally collect information about individuals under the age of thirteen (13). 

Some of the Services allow you to provide access to your Wave account to other authorized users, which we call “guest collaborators”. Guest collaborators have access to information in your Wave account, including Personal Information, and may perform various tasks on your behalf. You take full responsibility for any collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Information by your collaborator(s). 

To provide access to your account to a guest collaborator, you must provide the collaborator’s name and email address. We will send them a single email inviting them to the Site. Wave only uses this information to invite your collaborator. Please ensure that you only submit email addresses of individuals or businesses that you have a relationship with and who would want to receive the message. The guest collaborator may contact us at [privacy@waveapps.com](mailto:privacy@waveapps.com) to request that we remove their name and email address from our database. 

##  Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention (#5) 

We will use your Personal Information as described in this policy. 

We will share your Personal Information with third parties only as described in this policy. 

We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required by law or regulation. To be clear, that means we’ll retain your Personal Information while you have an active account, and afterward if we need to do so to meet our legal obligations. If you choose to close your Wave account, we will destroy your Personal Information within 60 days unless we are otherwise obliged to keep it longer. 

##  Accuracy (#6) 

Wave relies on you to provide us with information that is accurate and complete. We provide you the mechanisms and rely on you to keep your information up to date. You can request updates or corrections of any inaccuracies in your Personal Information at any time by contacting us at the contact information listed in the policy. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. 

##  Safeguards (#7) 

Wave uses a combination of reasonable and appropriate safeguards designed to protect your information. These safeguards are administrative controls (things like policies, procedures, and training), technical controls (things like encryption, firewalls, and secure coding frameworks), and physical controls (secured hosting environments). 

For additional details, please see our [security page](https://web.archive.org/security/). 

We ensure that any third party acting on our behalf maintains reasonable and appropriate safeguards in respect of your Personal Information. Additional information about our third parties’ privacy practices is available upon request. 

If you have questions about security on our Site, you can contact us at [security@waveapps.com](mailto:security@waveapps.com). 

You are also responsible for helping to protect the security of your Personal Information. For instance, never give out your email account information or your password for the Services to third parties. Our team will never request your password or PIN, and we ask that you never post account or credit card numbers to our support channels. 

##  Individual Access (#9) 

You may access, update and correct inaccuracies in the Personal Information in our custody or control at any time, subject to limited exceptions prescribed law. You can download or export data you input into the Site at any time, or to correct inaccuracies, simply log in to your account and make the necessary changes. 

You can also request access, corrections or updates to all your Personal Information, including information not available through your account, by contacting us as set out in the Challenging Compliance section of this document. We may request certain Personal Information for the purposes of verifying the identity of the individual seeking access to their personal information records.
