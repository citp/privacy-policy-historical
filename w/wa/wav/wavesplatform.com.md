COOKIES
You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access
cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible
or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please see Cookie Policy.
CHANGE OF PURPOSE
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider
that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish
to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose,
please contact us via e-mail support@wavesplatform.com.
If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal
basis which allows us to do so.
Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with
the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
5. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table
in paragraph 4 above.
     •   Third Parties who developed the Website and organize promotional and marketing activities.
     •   Third Parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets.
         Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to
         our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this
         privacy notice.
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the
law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and
only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.


6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
We share your personal data with our contractors to fulfil the purposes we collected it for. This will involve
transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA), namely to the Russian Federation and the
United States.
These countries may have less stringent privacy laws than we do, so any information they hold can become
subject to their laws and disclosure requirements, including disclosure to governmental bodies, regulatory
agencies and private persons. In addition, a number of countries have agreements under which information is
exchanged with other countries for law enforcement, tax and other purposes.
However, we ensure your personal data is protected by requiring all our contractors to follow the same rules
when processing your personal data.
Please contact us via e-mail support@wavesplatform.com if you want further information on the specific
mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
7. DATA SECURITY
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost,
used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal
data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They
will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any
applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. The transmission of data over the
internet (including by e-mail) is never completely secure. So, although we use appropriate measures to try to
protect personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to us or by us.
8. DATA RETENTION
HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY PERSONAL DATA FOR?
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including
for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data (Request erasure).
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with
you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further
notice to you.
9. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS
Under certain circumstances, you have the following rights under data protection laws in relation to your
personal data:
  •   Request access to your personal data.
  •   Request correction of your personal data.
  •   Request erasure of your personal data.
  •   Object to processing of your personal data.
  •   Request restriction of processing your personal data.
  •   Request transfer of your personal data.


  •   Right to withdraw consent.
If you wish to exercise any            of  the  rights   set   out  above,   please   contact   us   via e-mail
support@wavesplatform.com.
NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party
you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this
right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used
the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this
will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw
your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is
the case at the time you withdraw your consent. Please note that in certain circumstances it may be still lawful
for us to continue processing your information even where you have withdrawn your consent, if one of the
other legal bases is applicable.
