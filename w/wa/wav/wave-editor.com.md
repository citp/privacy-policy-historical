# NGWave Audio Editor: Privacy Policy

Your privacy and security are important to us. In this document we disclose what information is collected, and what is done with that information, when using our web site and software. 

When browsing our web site, our server collects the following information: 

  * Your IP Address
  * Your Web Browser Software
  * What pages referred you to our site



Most of this information is sent to the server by your browser software. All of the above information is collected by most all web sites, and this is considered standard practice for operating a world-wide web server. 

The information is used only for internal use, to ensure our web server is capable of providing the services needed. It is also used for statistical analisys, again only for internal use. Nothing is reported to any third parties for any reason. 

Our web site often links to third-parties. Next Generation Software, Inc. cannot be held responsible for the content of third-party web sites, or for their own privacy policies. It is recommended that you read the Privacy Policy for each web site you visit, or at least for those that you provide personally identifiable information to. 

Our software never reports any information to us. We have a very strong policy against so-called **Adware** and **Spyware**. These types of software are, in general, a violation of your privacy, and as such we do not advocate any software of this sort. 

We collect no additional information from you for downloading our products (except for Beta products). We want you to try our products anonymously, only providing information if you wish to do so, such as when making a purchase or requesting technical support. 

Our software does not utilize _any_ internet functionality, and thus makes no attempts to contact anyone for any reason. 

NGWave.com utilizes cookies for certain behaviors. Cookies are small bits of information that our web server sets on your computer, to be retrieved later. No other web site has access to these cookies, and we cannot access cookies set by other web sites. They are simply used to retain certain information regarding your browsing preferences. 

Note that Audio-Forums.com (our discussion site) utilizes cookies in order to keep you logged in, and to display discussions according to your preferences. 

We will _never_ allow so-called _third-party cookies_ \-- cookies that are sent back to some web server other than our own. Most web browsers will warn you when such cookies are being set, as this can sometimes be used in violation of your privacy rights. 

If you choose to sign up for our Newsletter, you will _only_ receive email directly from us. Your email address is kept private and never disclosed to anyone for any reason. We do not advocate sharing email lists with so-called _partner_ companies like many other companies do. 

You can be removed easily by visiting the [unsubscribe page](https://web.archive.org/list/unsubscribe.php). Removal happens immediately, and no further email will ever be sent to your address from us. 

In short, we value privacy as much as anyone else, and we will never violate your privacy for our own gain or benefit. We will never try to trick you into installing software, subscribing to a mailing list, or anything else that we ourselves wouldn't want to happen. 

We encourage you to enjoy our products and web resources, without the fear of risking your privacy. 

If you have any questions or comments on our Privacy Policy, please email [ Privacy@NGWave.com](mailto:privacy@ngwave.com).
