# Privacy Policy | WaveMaker

Your privacy is important to WaveMaker, Inc. (“WaveMaker”, “we”, “us” or “our”). This privacy policy provides details about how your personal information is collected and used by us. Personal information is any information that identifies you or would enable someone to contact you, such as your name, email address, phone number and other non-public information associated with your individual identity. This privacy policy explains our commitment to protecting the privacy of personal information about users of WaveMaker websites, software, products and services (collectively, the “Site”).

* #### Information Collected

We may collect personal information when you register to use the Site. Personal information may include your name, username, your password (we only store an encrypted version of this; not the actual password), one or more email addresses and other contact information.

If you use the Site from outside the United States, you consent to the transfer of your personal information to our systems in the United States and wherever we, our affiliates and service providers operate.

Like most web-based services, we may automatically collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data (“Usage Data”). We may associate Usage Data to your account information.

Like many websites, we may also use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site; and we may use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Site. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of our services. Your use of a “Do Not Track” option in your browser will not affect our data collection practices.

* #### Our Use of Information

We use the information collected to enable your access to and use of the Site, to personalize the Site for you, or to supply you services that you have asked for. We may use Usage Data that does not identify individual users to analyze trends and Site traffic, to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, or to administer, improve or promote the Site.

We may also occasionally contact you via email to tell you about Site maintenance, upgrades and new features regarding our services or those of our customers or business partners, but will provide you with a vehicle for opting out of these emails.

We do not sell, rent or share customer or user personal information with third parties. We do not sell customer lists to marketers.

We may contact you by email regarding your account. You may elect not to receive commercial marketing messages from us about the services.

We may assign you a user ID and password to use the Site. We assume no responsibility for preventing third parties (other than our own employees) from using your login credentials, whether with or without your permission.

* #### Public Posts and Testimonials

We have no obligation to keep the information you post to the public portions of the Site private or protected in any way. All such content may be published by us in any media in our discretion. We may display or decline to publish personal testimonials of users in our discretion. WaveMaker, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents assume no liability or responsibility for your use of the public portions of the Site to post comments, contributions or other information, or for any person’s use of any such information you post there.

* #### User and Customer Lists

Our customer and user list is an asset and trade secret of WaveMaker, Inc. and may be transferred with the company’s assets in connection with any merger, acquisition or change of control of the business of the company. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

* #### Required Disclosures

Except as stated in this privacy policy, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties except when we must comply with laws that require such disclosure to law enforcement authorities or other government third party officials such as subpoenas.

If we are required by law, regulation or legal process (e.g. subpoena) to disclose information about you, we will notify you to the extent permitted by law but we reserve the right to disclose such information as legally required in our judgment. We also may disclose information about your use of the Site if we have reason to believe you have used the Site for purposes prohibited in our Terms of Service or that it is necessary to avoid injury, damage to property or violation of someone’s rights.

* #### Security

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Any person who provides Personal Information through our site represents to us that he or she is 13 years of age or older. If we learn that Personal Information has been collected from a user under 13 years of age, then we will take the appropriate steps to cause this information to be deleted.
