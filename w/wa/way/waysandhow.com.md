Before going any further, we recommend that all users must review the Privacy Setting of their Facebook Account. That settings will identify the PII that may be shared with the Site.We do not access all of the information shared with us, but rather only those PII which we deemed helpful and can enhance the Site’s experience.

We make sure that all of the contents shown by such third parties are properly identified as really coming from them.Note that there are cases in which said third party sites, advertisers, and content providers or their duly authorized representative are using some kind of program or technology in delivering to the user’s browser the ads found in the Site. At times, they may possibly use action tags or single pixel gifs also called web bacons, cookies, java script, or any other program purposely to determine the level of effectiveness of their advertisements. It is also to patronize their advertising content. When any of these things happen, they instantly get your IP address.

We emphasize that the Site has neither control nor access on said cookies that the third party advertisers may use. This goes to saying that the information applications and practices of such parties are explicitly not within the ambit of this Policy, but rather the same are governed by their own privacy policy.
