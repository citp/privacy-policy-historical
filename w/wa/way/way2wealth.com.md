You should keep changing your password periodically. As a matter of precaution, we always give the details of your last login each time you log on to our site. In case you feel that the detail is not matching with your last login profile, it should give you an indication that somebody has been able to crack your login and password and is having unauthorized access to your details. In such circumstance, you should immediately change the password and also inform us about it. 

To ensure safety of your trading access, our technology automatically logs you out of the site if no activity is registered for 15 minutes. However you should ensure that each time you leave your terminal you log yourself out. This prevents someone else from accessing your account if you leave your computer and your session has not " **timed out** ".
