						<h4>Does Waytostay share the information it gathers?</h4>
						<p>No, your information being kept private is important for us as a service and we will never sell your information to others. We only share information in regards to the following:</p>
						<p><strong>Informing owners:</strong> When you book, your contact information (excluding email address) is forwarded along with your booking details to the apartment owner or their manager.</p>
						<p><strong>Protecting Waytostay and others:</strong> We release personal information when appropriate to comply with the law; to enforce agreements; and to protect the rights, property, or safety of Waytostay, to our users, or to others. This includes exchanging information to combat fraud and credit risk. However, we do not disclose customer information for commercial gain.</p>
						<p><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> Other than the above, we will inform you if we want to share your information with third parties and we will respect your consent or refusal.</p>
