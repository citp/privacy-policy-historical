Wayin provides marketing products and services to, and processes certain personal data on behalf of, its Clients. We provide our Clients access to our marketing campaign development and management platforms and related products, applications and services (in each case in whatever format they may be offered now or in the future, the “ **Platform** ”). Using our Platform, our Clients may develop marketing campaigns, content, and collect information using forms, surveys, social media, or other services (“ **Client** **Services** ”) that are provided via Client-controlled websites and other services (“ **Client** **Properties** ”).

#### 2\. Scope of this Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to the collection of data that relates to identified or identifiable information (“ **personal** **data** ”) on Wayin’s websites (including without limitation [www.wayin.com](http://www.wayin.com/) and any successor URLs, mobile or localized versions and related domains and subdomains, the “ **Website** ” or “ **Site** ”) and our Platform. The Website and Platform are collectively referred to herein as the “ **Wayin Services**.” Except as expressly described in the “Client Services” section below, this Privacy Policy does not apply to our Clients, or your use of the Client Services or Client Properties.

Our [Terms of Use](https://www.wayin.com/terms-of-use/) govern your use of our Site. Any capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy will have their definitions provided in our Terms of Use.

#### 3\. Client Services

Our Clients remain the owners and controllers of the personal data collected and used in connection with our Client Services and on any Client Property. Any personal data you submit through the Client Services, or on any Client Property, is governed by the Client’s privacy policy.

If you have questions regarding a Client’s collection and use of personal data, you should contact the Client with your requests or inquiries, or to exercise your rights. We will cooperate with our Clients to assist you in the exercise of the rights you have related to your personal data under applicable law.

#### 4\. Information We Collect

We collect the following types of personal data as a data controller through the Wayin Services. Such collection and use of personal data is separate from our processing of personal data in the context of providing the Client Services, where we act as a data processor on behalf of our Clients (see 3 above for further information):

**Registration Information.** We collect personal information about you when you register to use the Platform. The information you provide will include items such as your username, first and last name, company, business role, email address, or billing address.

This personal data typically includes your phone number, email address, or mailing address you provide through these forms.

**Biographical Information.** When you use our Site to submit an application to be a contractor, employee, or otherwise join or support our team, we collect certain personal data about your relevant background, such as your education, schools attended, job history, and other information requested on the application form.

**Financial Information.** As our Client, with a commercial agreement in place with us (e.g. a subscription to the Platform), we will also collect financial and transactional information, which depending on the circumstance will include accounts, contacts, bank details, billing and mailing addresses, and other payment-related information.

**Technical Information.** We collect personal data relating to how you interact with the Wayin Services, such as the IP address from which you access the Wayin Services, date and time, information about your browser, operating system and computer or device, pages viewed, and items clicked. Depending on the circumstance, we will also collect location information, including location information automatically provided by your computer or device or inferred by your IP address. Where permitted by applicable law, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect some of this information.

**Third Party Platforms.** In certain circumstances, we collect personal data when you interact with our advertisements and other content on third-party sites or platforms, such as social networking sites. In some cases, this includes information such as “Likes”, basic profile information gathered from social networking sites or the fact that you viewed or interacted with our content.

To identify representatives of businesses that may be interested in our products and services, we obtain contact details from social networks, such as LinkedIn and Twitter, as well as business-to-business marketing lead providers, such as DiscoverOrg and Lusha Systems Limited.

#### 5\. Our Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies

Where permitted by applicable law, our Site collects personal data via cookies and similar technologies, including cookies and similar technologies operated by third parties. Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. We also use pixel tags or web beacons, which are small images that allow us to determine the number of people who open our emails and information such as when and how many times the email was viewed, whether any links were clicked on, whether the email was forwarded, your approximate geographic location and browser and device type.

We typically use cookies on our Site in the following ways:

  * for “essential” purposes, such as allowing you to access secure areas of our Site;
  * for “functional” purposes, such as to enable various features of the Wayin Services such as remembering preferences, or staying logged in during your session;
  * for “analytics” purposes, consistent with our legitimate interests in how the Wayin Services is used or performs, how users engage with and navigate through the Wayin Services, what sites users visit before visiting our Platform, how often they visit our Platform, and other similar information;
  * for social media integration e.g. via third-party social media cookies, or when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on our Site or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook or Twitter; and
  * for the purpose of displaying advertisements via retargeting or other advertising platforms to those users who have visited our Site.



Note, where permitted by applicable law, some of these technologies can be used by us and/or our third-party partners to identify you across platforms, devices, sites, and services. We will seek consent, where required by law, to place any non-essential cookies on your computer or mobile device. Further, Clients may use additional cookies or other technologies as part of the Client Services that are not covered by this Privacy Policy.

When you use the Wayin Services, subject to applicable law we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal data upon your request and either provide you the means to correct this information if it is inaccurate, or to delete such information at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.

No method of transmission over the Internet, method of electronic storage or other security methods are one hundred percent secure. Therefore, while we strive to use reasonable efforts to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have questions about how to remove your posts or if you would like additional assistance with deletion you can contact us at data@wayin.com.

See the end of this policy document for further contact details.

###### 14.2     Legal bases for processing

We only use your personal data for the purposes described at 6 above and as permitted by applicable law. Under European data protection laws, we are required to inform you of the legal bases of our processing of your personal data, which are described in the table below. If you have questions about the legal basis of how we process your personal data, contact us at [data@wayin.com](mailto:data@wayin.com).

_Personal data_

When we collect and process your personal data (that are not special categories of personal data), such legal bases include:

  * **where the processing is necessary in our or a third party’s legitimate interests** : which include marketing our products or services to you, otherwise communicating with you, improving our Site, services or products and ensuring the security of our Site and in an employment context (see 6.7 above). In such cases, we have taken measures to ensure that this processing does not cause unwarranted prejudice to your privacy;

  * in limited circumstances, **where you give us your consent** ; and
  * **for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to** : see also 6.8 above.



_Special categories of personal data_

European data protection laws define certain special categories of personal data (“ **special categories of personal data** ”), which are subject to heightened protections under such laws. These special categories of personal data include information relating to an individual’s physical or mental health, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, trade union membership, religious beliefs, sexual life or genetic or biometric data.

In certain circumstances, we will also collect and process special categories of personal data that you provide to us, for example, your resume submission for a job opportunity posted on our Site. In such cases, the legal bases we will rely on to collect and process this information include:

  * for the purposes of **performing or exercising our or your obligations or rights in the context of employment law** ; and
  * in limited circumstances, **where you give us your explicit consent**. If we do ask you for your consent to collect and process special categories of personal data, we will provide you with full details of the information we are seeking from you and the reason why, in order for you to make an informed decision. It is not a condition of your employment relationship with us that you agree to any such request.



###### 14.3     Retention

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

For example, depending on the circumstances we are required to keep basic information about our customers (including contact, registration, and financial information) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.

In some circumstances we will anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) in which case we can use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

###### 14.4     Your rights

European data protection laws give you certain rights regarding your personal data. You may ask us to take the following actions in relation to your personal data that we hold, to the extent required by law, you have the following rights:

  * **Opt-out.** Stop sending you direct marketing communications on your request. Depending on the circumstance, you will continue to receive Service-related and other non-marketing emails.
  * **Access.** Provide you with information about our processing of your personal data and give you access to your personal data on your request.
  * **Correct.** Update or correct inaccuracies in your personal data on your request.
  * **Delete.** Delete your personal data our your request.
  * **Export.** Transfer a machine-readable copy of your personal data to you or a third party of your choice on your request.
  * **Restrict.** Restrict the processing of your personal data on your request.

  * **Contact Regulator.** If you would like to submit a complaint about our use of your personal data or response to your requests regarding your personal data, you may contact us at [data@wayin.com](mailto:data@wayin.com) or submit a complaint to the data protection regulator in the jurisdiction where you live or work. You can find your data protection regulator [here](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm).



Also, in any situation where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent to such processing.

You can submit these requests by email to [data@wayin.com](mailto:data@wayin.com) or our postal address provided at the end of the policy. We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. Applicable law may require or permit us to decline your request. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions.

###### 14.5     Cross-Border Data Transfer

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the European Economic Area (EEA) to countries not deemed by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of personal data protection, the transfer will be based on one of the following safeguards recognized by the European Commission as providing adequate protection for personal data, where required by EU data protection legislation:

  * Contracts approved by the European Commission which impose data protection obligations on the parties to the transfer. For further details, see European Commission Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.
  * For transfers to third parties in the United States, ensuring they participate in the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.



Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA, including if you wish to request a copy of the relevant transfer mechanism.
