# Privacy Policy | Wayin - Social Media Marketing

This Privacy Policy applies to Wayin.com (the “Site”) and other services provided to third parties by Wayin, Inc. as further described below (“Services”).  By using the Site or the Services, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy, you may not use our Site or Services.

**Scope of this Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy applies to information collected through our Site, and also describes certain privacy practices with regard to the Services provided by Wayin to third parties.  The Services include without limitation, social media hubs, widgets, and APIs for use on third party sites or in third party broadcast programming.  The Services typically include feeds of “tweets” (consisting of text, pictures, videos, links to websites, or other content) provided to Wayin by Twitter, Inc. (“Twitter”), as well as other social media content created by end-users and provided through other social media platforms (together with tweets, the “Social Media Content”).  This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may provide to us by email, phone, fax, written agreements, or otherwise. 

“PII” means “personally identifiable information,” which is information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us (including without limitation your name, address, email address, telephone number, or other personal information). “Non-PII” means “non-personally identifiable information” or other information which alone does not identify you.  We sometimes refer to both PII and Non-PII in this Privacy Policy as “Information.”  Social Media Content may include PII and/or Non-PII, depending on the content voluntarily submitted to the social media platform by the applicable end-user. 

**Collection of Your Information**

**Social Media Content.  **

Anything a Twitter user may tweet to a hashtag being used by one of the Services, or any other Social Media Content submitted by an end-user to the applicable social media platform and which is then automatically provided by that platform to Wayin (via API or otherwise), may instantly be visible to anyone viewing the applicable Service anywhere in the world (subject to the privacy settings you have established in your account with the applicable social media platform).  By submitting any public Social Media Content (as controlled by your account settings with the applicable social media platform, if any) to the applicable hashtag promoted in a Service, or otherwise in a manner that transmits such Social Media Content to a Service, you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure, and other use of the Information contained within the Social Media Content, to any country in which the Service is provided.  You further consent that any Information you tweet or otherwise post to a social media platform will be provided by you directly to the applicable social media platform, and accordingly will be subject to that platform’s own Privacy Policy and the controls you have established on your social media account with that platform (including without limitation the privacy settings for that account, if any).

**Optional Voluntary Information.**  In order to request information about Wayin or our Services, or otherwise contact us through our Site, you may be required to voluntarily submit certain PII such as your name and email address.  Sweepstakes or other promotions may occasionally be offered through our Services, which may require the submission of PII to enter the promotion.  Please keep in mind that if you enter a promotion on our Services, your entry information may be provided directly to the applicable third party client of Wayin, rather than (or possibly in addition to) Wayin. Contacting us through our Site, or entering any of these promotions, is purely optional, so you are not required to submit any PII through our Site or Services if you do not wish to contact us in this manner or participate in the applicable promotion.

**Usage Data**. Wayin may track user traffic patterns and content accessed throughout our Site or Services. This information allows us to better tailor our content to meet the needs of our users and clients, and to help us better understand our audience.

**Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser**. We may collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser, such as your IP address, the address of the web page you were visiting when you accessed our Site, information on your operating system and browser, and the date and time of your visit. Such information does not by itself identify you personally.  In addition, we may review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network.

**Client Dashboards**. If our clients choose to access the online dashboards by which they can control our Services (which may be accessible through our Site), we will collect only the Information required to log in to the dashboard.  You do not need to provide this Information to us unless you choose to use the applicable dashboard.

**Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies**

Our Site, or our current or future service providers, may place a text file called a “cookie” on your computer, which may store preferences or other information, and may be used to help personalize your experience when using our Site. We may use cookies to learn the source of traffic to our Site (including the site you were visiting before you came to our Site), and to store your other preferences when using our Site.  We or our third party service providers may also use cookies or other technologies for site analytics purposes and to collect certain data regarding the actions of our users online.  You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. 

Our Services may use cookies (which may include third party cookies) to track usage of content within the Services, sources of traffic to the Services, administrative rights for the Services, and other analytics related to the Services.  Wayin’s clients who feature our Services on their own sites may also use cookies or similar technologies for tracking, analytics, or other purposes. 

Because there is not yet a common standard regarding how to interpret web browser based “do not track” signals, our Site and the Services do not currently respond to undefined web browser “do not track” signals.  Neither our Site nor the Services contain cookies or mechanisms to track users across their use of other websites.  If you wish to take steps to opt-out of tracking by certain online advertisers, you can visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-put page at http://www.aboutads.info/choices.

We may also disclose the PII we collect through our Site or Services when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law (or respond to any legal process such as a court order or subpoena, government requests in the U.S. or other countries, or requests related to national security in accordance with applicable laws); to prevent or investigate a possible crime such as fraud or identity theft; to enforce the Terms of Use or other agreements that govern your use of our Site or Services; to protect the rights, property or safety of Wayin, our affiliated companies, our clients, our users or others; or to protect your vital interests. Information submitted to our Site or Services is an asset of Wayin, and will become part of our normal business records. Any information collected on our Site or Services, including without limitation PII, may be transferred to any entity related to Wayin in the present or future, or to another company that has acquired the stock or assets of Wayin, for example, as the result of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation. If such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company’s use of your PII will still be subject to this Privacy Policy, and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.

Please be aware that by using our Site or Services you are deemed to have accepted and agreed to the sharing of your Information collected through our Site and Services in the manner described in this Privacy Policy, and the sharing of your Social Media Content in accordance with the terms and policies of the applicable social media platform through which it was initially submitted, and we will not be required to obtain your consent for any disclosure described herein.
