 <p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Order Forms and Purchases</h3>
 <p>Our   site uses an order form for you to purchase information, products, and   services. We collect your contact information (i.e., mail and e-mail   addresses), financial information (i.e., credit card numbers), and   demographic information (i.e., zip code and state). We use this contact   information from the order form to send you a confirmation e-mail for   which you cannot opt out.

Financial information that is collected is used to   bill for products and services. Financial information is not retained or   stored as part of your shopping profile, so you must enter your credit   card number each time you place an order.

We may use this   contact data from our surveys to send you information about our company.   Unique identifiers are collected from the Web site to verify your   identity.

We also sometimes receive   updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other   sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next   purchase or communication more easily.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Sharing with Third Parties</h3>
 <p>In   the unlikely event that the Company or substantially all of its assets,   are acquired or merged with another company, customer information will   be one of the transferred assets. Information collected on this Web site   from those who have elected to receive offers from business partners of   the Company is made available to such business partners. We release   account and other personal information when we believe release is   appropriate to comply with law or to protect the rights, property, or   safety of the Company, our users, or others. This includes exchanging   information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection   and credit risk reduction. We also, from time to time, provide our   customer lists to businesses who offer goods or services through direct   mail that may be of value to our customers. The information provided   includes; name, address, gender, product(s) purchased and recency of   purchase.</p>
