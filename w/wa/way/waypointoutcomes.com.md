# Privacy Policy - Waypoint Outcomes | Waypoint Outcomes

**WAYPOINTOUTCOMES.COM PRIVACY POLICY**

Welcome to Waypointoutcomes.com (the “Site”). This Site is owned and operated by Bridgepoint Education, Inc. (the “Company”, or “we” or “us”). We respect your privacy. This policy explains how information about you will be treated as you make use of this Site and/or the services available through this Site and the Waypoint software application (collectively, the “Services”).

We provide the Services to you subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. By using the Services or submitting personally identifiable information about yourself, you are expressly consenting to our use of your information as described below and agreeing to this Privacy Policy. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before you submit any of your personal information on this Site or through the Services.

Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. The Revision Date below will show you when the Privacy Policy was last revised. By continuing to use the Services, you accept and agree to any revisions to the Privacy Policy.

**REVISION DATE**

This Privacy Policy was last revised on July 15, 2013.

**APPLICATION OF THE PRIVACY POLICY**

This Privacy Policy applies solely to the use of the Site and use of the Services. The Services may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or operated by us. We have no control over, and we assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party website. By using the Services, you release us from any claim or liability arising from your use of any third party website.

**WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT, AND HOW IS IT USED?**

When you visit the Site or use the Services, we may collect passive information about your visit. Passive information is any form of aggregate data, navigational data, tracking data, click-stream data, or historical data, which does not on its own personally identify you.

For example, when you visit the Site our servers may collect some basic technical information, including your IP address, the domain name of your ISP (e.g., whether you logged on from aol.com or whitehouse.gov), referral data (e.g., the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to our Site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Firefox browser on a Macintosh platform). Your IP address may be collected to determine your geographical location; we may share this information with publishers of textbooks available on the Site as part of our compliance with the publishers’ security requirements. We will not provide to the publishers any information in connection with your IP address that may allow a publisher to identify you.

The Site also uses electronic files such as cookies, web beacons, or log file information to: (1) identify unique browsers that visit the Site; (2) track usage throughout the Site (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the Site, etc.); (3) store information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Site; and (4) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.

We may share aggregate statistical information with business partners, publishers, or other third parties, but none of them will receive personally identifiable information. For example, we may tell a publisher that X number of trial members accessed a certain area of the Site or viewed a certain textbook, but we will not disclose anything that uniquely identifies those individuals.

From time to time, we may establish a business relationship with other businesses to perform services on our behalf, with whom we may share your personal information (“Service Providers”). For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services, such as hosting and maintenance, customer relationship management, data storage and management, and direct marketing campaigns. We provide our Service Providers with only the information necessary for them to perform these services on our behalf. Each Service Provider must agree to use reasonable security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information involved, in order to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

In addition to the above, we also reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to comply with the law or protect the rights, property, or safety of the Site or Services, our users, publishers, or others. Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.

**SECURITY**

We endeavor to safeguard and protect your information. We utilize electronic and physical security to reduce the risk of improper access to or manipulation of the information you submit during transmission and storage; however, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit, and you do so at your own risk.

**CHILDREN’S ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION**

The Site and Services comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. The Site and Services are not targeted to children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. It is possible that through others’ mistake or deception we may receive information pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately obtain parental consent or delete the information from our servers. If you believe we have received information from a child under 13, please notify us by emailing us at [privacy@bridgepointeducation.com](mailto:privacy@bridgepointeducation.com).

**CHANGES TO THIS POLICY**

We may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you that changes have been made by posting the revised Privacy Policy on this Site and updating the Revision Date shown at the beginning of the Privacy Policy. We may also provide a brief summary of the revisions. By continuing to use the Site and/or the Services, you accept and agree to any revisions to the Privacy Policy.

**QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS**

If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints about our privacy policies and use of personal information, please send them to [privacy@bridgepointeducation.com](mailto:privacy@bridgepointeducation.com).
