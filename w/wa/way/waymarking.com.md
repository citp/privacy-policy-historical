  3. **WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?**

Except as provided below, we do not share or sell information that identifies our users personally or makes it possible for other parties to contact them directly. We share your information as follows:

    1. **Other Users.**  We may disclose personal information to other people who use our services if you choose to include personal information, such as your email address, photo or other details, in your public profile. Your username and location and any other information or content you post publicly will be shared with others when you use the public features of our services, such as logging a geocache or participating in the discussion forums. If you choose to participate in forum discussions, your IP address may be shared with forum moderators at Groundspeak's discretion.

    2. **Partners.**  We license our API to partners who use it to develop other geocaching-related services, including websites and mobile applications. Any information you have included on your public profile or geocache logs (including photos) will be accessible to them through the API. Additionally, we share home coordinates with our API partners and randomize the decimal portion of the degrees. Our API License Agreement ([ _http://www.geocaching.com/live/api_license_agreement.aspx_](http://www.geocaching.com/live/api_license_agreement.aspx)) requires our API partners to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy with regard to any information acquired through our API or submitted through use of their websites or mobile applications. We provide location information to our map providers without identifying you specifically for the purpose of enabling map functionality. Additionally, we may partner with other companies/organizations to provide promotions, GeoTours, and Geocaching Adventures. If you choose to participate, the information you provide may be shared via our API or otherwise to enable your participation and to allow the sponsor to contact you.

    3. **Social Media.**  We, or our partners, may share the contents of your geocaching logs, including text, photos and/or username on social media. If you choose to log in to your account with or through a social networking service, Groundspeak and that service may share certain information about you and your activities. Additionally, with your permission, we also may share information about your activities on our services with that social network's users.

    4. **Third Party Service Providers.**  From time to time, we employ other companies and individuals to perform specialized functions on our behalf, such as analytics, secure credit card processing and email service providers. They may have access to personal information needed to perform these functions but will be prohibited from using it for other purposes.

    5. **Protection of Us and Others.**  We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or comply with legal process served on Groundspeak; or (b) protect and defend our rights or property, our services, users or the public.

    6. **Business Transfers.**  In the unlikely event that we sell a portion of or all of our business or in the event that we reorganize, customer records would likely be transferred to the acquiring company or new entity; however, any personal information in those records will remain subject to the promises made in the pre-existing privacy policy.

  4. **HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?**

Groundspeak has implemented many security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your information. We protect your account information through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of your information you MUST keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. We also work to protect the security of your credit card information during transmission through the use of third party payment processors using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information you input. However, keep in mind that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.

  5. **WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE?**

    1. You can always choose not to provide information, even though it may be needed to use our services.

    2. You can add or update certain information by signing in to your account and accessing your account settings.

    3. If you do not want to receive our newsletter or marketing communications from us, you can click the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the email you receive. This will not affect our ability to send you communications regarding your account.

    4. If you do not want to receive emails from us about specific geocaches or Trackables, you can change your preferences by logging into your account and removing these geocaches and/or Trackables from your Watchlist or bookmarks. Please note that you cannot disable notifications related to geocaches or Trackables owned by you.

    5. If you have granted us access to your Facebook or Twitter account by linking, you can disconnect the link by logging into your account, accessing your profile and clicking the Facebook or Twitter icon to disconnect.

  6. **HOW WE USE COOKIES**

We use cookies and common automated data collection technologies, including web beacons, clear GIFs associated with cookies and Adobe Flash local shared objects, on our websites and applications, in order to provide certain services, such as logging a geocache, and to allow you to sign up for information from us.

We gather date, time, certain information about a user's browser and system or device configuration and capabilities, navigation history and IP address for all visitors to our websites. We use this information for our system administration and security and to gather general information about our audiences and their geographic locations.

**A. Our cookies.**  We place cookies that identify you, or allow third parties to do so on our behalf, for the following purposes:

    1. to recognize you automatically when you return to our websites and mobile applications and to customize certain features and functions;

    2. to understand your interests in content, both our own content and that of other companies, on or across our websites and mobile applications;

    3. to make an automated record of your activities on our websites and mobile applications; and

    4. to manage, track and follow up on email campaigns.

We use third party tools such as Google Analytics cookies and HotJar to track how groups or categories of users interact with our services. We enable Google Analytics’ User-ID feature to better understand how users interact with our services over an extended period of time, from different devices and multiple sessions, so we can continue to improve our service and provide the best experience for our users. User ID is an anonymous identifier that helps identify unique users across multiple devices and browsers. When you log-in to use our services, your User ID is sent to Google Analytics and functions as your online alias. Google connects your User ID to your online behavior. Users who do not want their data collected with Google Analytics in this way can install the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on for each of their devices: <https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881>. The Google Analytics opt-out add-on is designed to be compatible with a variety of browsers, including Chrome, Internet Explorer 8-11, Safari, Firefox and Opera. We use HotJar cookies on our websites to help us gather feedback from you and to learn how you are using our services, such as the webpages you visit and how you interact with them. This information is transmitted to and stored on HotJar’s servers in Ireland. More information on HotJar and the HotJar cookies we may use from time to time is available here: <https://www.hotjar.com/privacy>. You can opt out of having HotJar collect your information here: <https://www.hotjar.com/opt-out>.

Additionally, you may use the tools in your browser to decline, disable, or delete any cookies. You will still be able to log on as a member if you decline or delete our persistent cookie that enables automatic recognition, but many important features of our websites will not be available, e.g. you will not be able to log a geocache if persistent cookies have been disabled. If you disable the session cookie for our websites, you may remain on the site but you will not be able to use Shop Geocaching and access certain other content.

**B. Third party advertising cookies.**  We allow other companies to serve ads on our web pages. We do not control their use of cookies or other data collection technologies or practices. We currently allow Google AdSense to serve ads on our websites. Google uses other companies, such as PointRoll and Nielsen/Netratings to help it serve ads. Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to you based on your visit to our websites and/or other sites on the Internet. Google and some of the companies it works with may offer additional choices about your preferences. Please visit Google for more information about the technologies it uses, the types of information it collects and its privacy practices. Please visit Google and use "Ads Settings" to set your preferences. The website [http://www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/) offers useful information about ad networks and a single place to turn off targeted ad serving from any of its members. We may add or change the list of third party advertisers from time to time without changing the effective date of the Privacy Policy itself. We urge you to check this section for changes regularly.

  7. **HOW CAN YOU CHANGE OR DELETE THE INFORMATION WE HAVE?**

Access "Account Settings" to change or delete information yourself. If you need help or have questions about changing or deleting the information we have collected, please [ _email us_](http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=request) or write to us at Groundspeak, Inc., Attn: Corporate Counsel, 837 N. 34th Street, Suite 300, Seattle WA 98103.

  8. **WHAT CAN I DO IF MY CHILD HAS PROVIDED PERSONAL INFORMATION?**

Our services are not intended for use by children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that personal information of someone less than 13-years-of-age has been collected through our services, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your minor child has obtained an account without your consent, then you may alert us [ _via email_](mailto:contact@geocaching.com) and request that we delete that child's personal information.

  9. **WHAT IF I DO NOT LIVE IN THE U.S.?**

If you use our services outside of the United States, you understand and consent to the transfer of your personal information to, and the collection, processing and storage of your personal information in the United States. The laws regarding personal information in the United States may differ and be less stringent than your local laws.

  10. **CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS**

California law permits users who are California residents to request certain information regarding disclosure of their personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send us an [_email_](http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=request) specifying that you seek your “California Customer Choice Notice.”  Please allow thirty days for a response.

This Privacy Shield Policy (“Policy”) applies to all personal data transferred to Groundspeak, Inc. (“Groundspeak”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) from an organization in the European Economic Area (EEA) (which includes the member states of the European Union (EU) plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). This Policy sets out our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting and disclosing that personal data. Our general Privacy Policy applies to information that individuals give us about themselves through our websites, applications and services.

**DEFINITIONS**

For purposes of this Policy, the following definitions shall apply:

**“Agent”** means any third party that collects or uses personal data under the instructions of, and solely for, Groundspeak or to which Groundspeak discloses personal data for use on Groundspeak’s behalf.

**“Groundspeak”** means Groundspeak, Inc., which does business as Geocaching and Geocaching HQ, and any predecessors and successors in the United States.

**“Personal data”** means any data or set of data that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of Groundspeak to identify (together with other data) a living individual. Personal data does not include data that is anonymized or aggregated.

**“Sensitive data”** means any personal data that reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data that concerns health or sex life, or data about criminal or administrative proceedings and sanctions. 

**EU-U.S. PRIVACY SHIELD**

Groundspeak complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the EU to the U.S., respectively. Groundspeak has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice; Choice; Accountability for Onward Transfer; Security; Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation; Access; and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability (“the Privacy Shield Principles”) which are the basis for the principles of this Policy. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>.

**PRINCIPLES**

**Notice**

Groundspeak receives personal data about individuals in the EEA collected by Groundspeak and partners who promote geocaching and/or use geocaching to promote their products or locations in Europe. Groundspeak uses this personal data to provide services enabling individuals to participate in location-based play and customer support, information updates and purchases related to such services and in geocaching-related promotions. This data also facilitates our partners’ participation in geocaching-related marketing and promotions and enables partners to develop other geocaching services.

**Choice**

Groundspeak will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their data is to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. An individual may opt-out of such uses of their personal data by contacting us at the address given below.

Groundspeak will not use sensitive personal data for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected, or subsequently authorized by the individual, without first receiving the individual’s affirmative and explicit consent (opt-in). Groundspeak will treat as sensitive any personal data received from a third party where the third party identifies and treats it as sensitive.

**Accountability for Onward Transfer**

Groundspeak may employ third parties to manage its IT infrastructure, provide credit card processing and customer support, perform analytics, and manage its email service. These entities may have access to personal information if needed to perform their functions for Groundspeak. 

Groundspeak may also disclose personal data – such as public profile information and geocache logs – to non-agent third parties by licensing its application program interface (API) to partners who use it to develop other geocaching-related services. If you wish to opt-out of transfers to such non-agent third parties, please contact us at the address given below or change your authorizations in Account Settings to stop such sharing of data.

Groundspeak may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

For data received under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, Groundspeak will obtain appropriate assurances from its agents that they will safeguard personal data consistent with this Policy. Examples of appropriate assurances that may be provided by agents include the following: a contract obligating the agent to provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield, its own EU-U.S Privacy Shield certification, or another European Commission adequacy finding.

Groundspeak’s accountability for personal data that it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Groundspeak remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Groundspeak proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

**Security**

Groundspeak will take reasonable and appropriate precautions to protect personal data in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

**Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation**

Groundspeak will use personal data only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Groundspeak will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete and current.

**Access**

Upon request, Groundspeak will grant individuals reasonable access to personal data that it holds about them. Groundspeak will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete personal data that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete. An individual may request access to their data, or otherwise correct, amend, or delete their personal data by contacting us at the address given below or by making changes to their Account Settings.

**Recourse, Enforcement and Liability**

In compliance with the EU-U.S Privacy Shield, Groundspeak commits to resolve complaints about privacy and personal data collection or use. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this Policy should first contact Groundspeak at the address given below. Groundspeak will investigate and attempt to resolve such complaints by reference to the principles contained in this Policy.

Groundspeak has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD web site at [www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/](https://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/)for more information and to file a complaint.

Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel.

Groundspeak is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Groundspeak will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Policy. Any employee that Groundspeak determines is in violation of this policy may be subject to disciplinary action.

**CONTACT INFORMATION**

Questions regarding this Policy should be submitted to Groundspeak by e-mail to contact@geocaching.com:

Or by postal mail to:

Geocaching HQ 837 N. 34th Street, Suite 300 Seattle, WA 98103 USA

**LIMITATIONS & CHANGES**

Groundspeak may also be required to disclose an individual’s personal data in response to a lawful request by public authorities or in connection with a legal obligation. Adherence by Groundspeak to these Privacy Shield Principles may also be limited to the extent necessary to meet national security, public interest or law enforcement obligations, and to the extent expressly permitted by an applicable law, rule or regulation.
