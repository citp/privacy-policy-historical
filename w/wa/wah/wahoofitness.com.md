# Privacy Policy and Impressum | Wahoo Fitness

The website www.wahoofitness.com and Wahoo Fitness applications (e.g., Wahoo Fitness, 7 Minute Workout, RunFit, Wahoo Wellness, Segments) are provided by Wahoo Fitness LLC through its offices in the United States. Wahoo Fitness recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of personal and financial information. We have instituted strict policies and security measures to protect your information. When you register with Wahoo Fitness through our applications, online or use our online store, you give us your consent to process and use your personal data in accordance with this online privacy policy. This Privacy Policy applies to all users of this website and our applications.

### Wahoo Fitness Applications:

Wahoo Fitness Applications are designed to provide fitness services by gathering data about you and tracking your activities. In order to access data collected across all of the Wahoo Fitness applications, users must create a Wahoo Fitness account. At that time, we ask you for some personal information, including your email address and name. You will also be asked to enter information about yourself, including your date of birth, gender, height, and weight which will be used by the Wahoo Fitness applications to provide calorie burn and heart rate zone information. As you use Wahoo Fitness applications to exercise, data (e.g., heart rate, steps, cadence, power, speed, etc.) is collected by your smartphone plus sensors you pair to your phone and passed into storage in our application on your smartphone. Once captured there, that data is transferred to the Wahoo Fitness Cloud for reporting and analysis in our applications. We also log data about the transmission, including the date and time of the exercise, type of exercise, type of smartphone used, version of operating system on that device, versions of firmware on sensors, and version of the application used.

  


### 3rd Party Applications:

Wahoo Fitness also sends and receives data to the third party applications and services you select in the configuration of our applications. You may activate or deactivate these connections at any time within our applications.

  


### Apple HealthKit:

Wahoo Fitness ® applications for Apple iOS use data from Apple’s HealthKit API to calculate calorie burn, heartrate zones, and other fitness-related purposes only if you activate this interface within the application. Wahoo does not sell any of your personal data for any other purposes.

  


### Location Features:

Location features such as mapping, routes, GPS-based speed calculations, and Live Tracking are only available if you activate them. When active, Wahoo Fitness collects data like GPS signals, device sensors, Wi-Fi access points, and cell tower IDs to determine your specific location. We store this information along with your other exercise data to provide you with these locations features. If you are using a mapping feature, we will send your location information to our mapping service provider so they can display your location on a map. You can deactivate these features at any time and Wahoo Fitness will stop collecting this type of information.
