Although information collected, used or disclosed on the Internet as described below often does not constitute Personal Information (and to the extent that such is the case, then the obligations under the Covers Media Group Ltd. Privacy Policy do not extend to such information), Covers Media Group Ltd. provides the details below about Internet aspects of Covers Media Group Ltd. services for the purposes of disclosure. 

**Internet Protocol Address (IP Address)**   
When the user's web browser requests a web page from another computer on the Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send the information. This address is called the computer's "IP address." For most users accessing the Internet from a dial-up Internet service provider (ISP), the IP address will be different every time the user logs on.   
Covers Media Group Ltd. may use the user's IP Address to: 

a) Facilitate the diagnosis and remedy of a technical problem reported by the user's or Covers Media Group Ltd's technical team. 

b) Display (or allow the display by Third Party advertising providers of) more appropriate and relevant content and advertising, such as content and advertising based on the user's geographic area. 

c) Estimate user traffic from specific countries or organizations. Many IP addresses are commonly associated with Internet service providers, universities, or major corporations in specific regions or localities. Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers. 

**Cookies**   
A cookie is a small text file, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to the user's web browser from a web site's computers and is stored on the user's computer's hard drive. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to a user's computer.   
Covers Media Group Ltd. may use cookies to: 

a) Improve the operation and performance of the Covers Media Group Ltd. services and to make Covers Media Group Ltd. services easier and more convenient to use. For example, cookies help Covers Media Group Ltd. provide more personalized services by recalling user preferences on subsequent visits (e.g. language preference). Cookies also allow Covers Media Group Ltd. to save passwords and preferences for a user so that the user will not have to re-enter them on the next visit to a Covers Media Group Ltd. website; 

b) Measure aggregate user traffic and demographic statistics related to Covers Media Group Ltd. websites and advertisements (e.g. number of users, average time spent, average age and similar statistics). This information helps Covers Media Group Ltd. to better understand when to update, change or offer new services and provides Covers Media Group Ltd. with details as to the performance of Third Party advertisements and content. This information may be reported, in aggregate form only, to Covers Media Group Ltd's current and prospective sponsors, advertisers and business partners. No Personal Information will be disclosed in such reports; 

c) Display advertisements. Covers Media Group Ltd. and Third Party advertising providers may use cookies when serving advertisements on Covers Media Group Ltd. websites. In some cases, advertisements from Third Party advertisers are delivered to users (in conjunction with Covers Media Group Ltd. services) by such Third Party advertisers, or by separately contracted advertising providers on their behalf, and not by Covers Media Group Ltd.; as such, the Third-party advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the Covers Media Group Ltd. Privacy Policy, and users should consult the privacy policies of such Third Party advertisers. 

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If a user prefers, the user can reset his/her browser either to notify the user when the user has received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies.
