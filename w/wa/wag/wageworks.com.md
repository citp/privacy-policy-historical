Information Collection and Use

WageWorks is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. WageWorks collects information from our users at several different points on our website and will advise you if you are leaving our site to go to another. 

Registration

In order to use our website, mobile site, or our mobile application, you must first complete the registration/employee profile form. During registration you will be required to give your contact information such as name, email address, date of birth, home or business address. This information is used to fulfill product orders. WageWorks cannot process your online orders and/or claims without the registration information or allow access to the secure portion of our website, as we need to verify status and eligibility. It is optional for you to provide demographic information, but we encourage this so we can provide a more personalized service experience.

Product Orders/Benefit Elections

We request information from you on order forms. To make an order or benefit election, you must have logon access to our site, and must have provided contact information (like name and shipping address) and possibly financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information may be used to get in touch with you. 

Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing information about you. After you enter your username and password and click the Log On button, we will use a session ID cookie to indicate the beginning of your session with WageWorks and make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. If you reject cookies, you will not be able to log on to our site. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by www.wageworks.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers or other third party sites that you may access through a direct link from ours.

Log Files

We record your IP addresses when you access our site to comply with laws and regulations. We also use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track your movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 

Sharing

We will share aggregated information with our partners such as purchase trends and demographic data. This is not linked to any personal information that can be used to identify any individual person.

We use outside companies to ship products to your home or office. With the exception stated in the next paragraph, these companies do not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

Some transit agencies or providers require us to provide certain personal information, such as your name and address, in order for us to procure the transit media on your behalf. Similarly, when you use the Pay My Provider function for parking and van pool, you will need to provide certain identifying information about you (e.g., your car's license plate number for parking). The information we pass onto these transit, parking or vanpool providers is the same information you would have to provide to these entities if you did not order the products or services through WageWorks. YOU SHOULD NOT EXPECT ANY GREATER PRIVACY OR SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MERELY BECAUSE IT WAS PASSED TO THOSE ENTITIES THROUGH WAGEWORKS. WAGEWORKS MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY ABOUT THESE ENTITIES AND HOW THEY WILL TREAT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. IF YOU CANNOT ACCEPT THIS RISK, YOU SHOULD NOT USE OUR SERVICES.

We partner with other parties to provide specific services. We contract with third party vendors to assist us in delivering our services to our customers. These vendors include third parties, such as claims processors, data processors, fulfillment houses and strategic partners. They perform services on our behalf to our employee participants and employer clients. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.   
We do not ask you for, access, or track any location based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our Mobile Apps, sites, or services. 

Links

This website contains links to other sites. Please be advised that WageWorks is not responsible for the privacy practices of or the content included on such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website. 

Surveys

From time to time our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you also have the choice to fill out the survey anonymously. Information requested may concern WageWorks’ processes, website usage, planned purchases and requested features. Contact information will be used to verify the validity of the input. Survey information will be used for the purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this WageWorks website or for future product development. 

Tell My Employer

If you elect to use our referral service for informing others about our site, we will ask you for a contact name and email address. WageWorks will choose whether to send the contact person information about our company and services. The person named in the referral may contact WageWorks at [info@wageworks.com](mailto:info@wageworks.com) to request the removal of their information from our database. 

Security

Our websites and mobile application take every precaution to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via our websites or mobile application, your information is protected both online and offline.

When our registration/profile asks you to enter sensitive information such as date of birth, home address and social security number, that information is encrypted using SSL. During this process, you will be asked to create a username and password that establishes your account. Once the account is established, you must log on to update your profile, place orders or review account status - all of which are done on secure pages. While on a secure page, such as the registration or 'My Account' page, the icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer will show a 'locked' status.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information offline. All of your information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific function - such as customer support - are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to regain access to any applications.

All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every year, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure that your information is protected. Finally, the servers that we use to store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.

If you have any questions about the security of our website, you can send an email to [info@wageworks.com](mailto:info@wageworks.com).

Confirmation Email and Selected Correspondence

Established participants may periodically receive information on products and service enhancements or survey requests regarding the use of our site. Out of respect for your,privacy we present the option of not receiving these types of communications. Please see our opt-out statement below. 

Updating Personal Information

If your personally identifiable information changes such as your delivery address, we provide a way to correct, update or remove personal data that is provided to us. This can be done at the Employee Profile section of the website or via email to [info@wageworks.com](mailto:info@wageworks.com). Your personal information can also be updated based upon data provided to us from your employer.

Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
