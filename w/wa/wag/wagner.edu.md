Section III: Policies for web managers of wagner.edu

All official departments and offices of Wagner College must maintain their primary web presence on wagner.edu, and must use the templates and designs provided or approved by the Office of Communications and Marketing. This ensures consistent design and navigation across the College. Personal Faculty and Student Sites may use different themes, templates, and designs (faculty.wagner.edu and students.wagner.edu); policies and guidelines for those sites are found elsewhere.

### Site Structure

  1. Major departments and offices are contained in the root directory of wagner.edu. For example, wagner.edu/cace and wagner.edu/anthropology. Centers, services, and units that belong to these major offices must be contained in the website of the larger office. For example, the Biological Sciences Department website houses the EM Center, and the Theatre and Speech Department website (wagner.edu/theatre) houses information on the theatre season, the arts administration major, the Stanley Drama Award, and all other programs contained within the department.
  2. URLs should be kept as short as reasonably possible and use hyphens to separate words. For example, wagner.edu/res-ed, not wagner.edu/residential_education.



### Management

  1. Department/Office Responsibilities. Each department and office of Wagner College is responsible for its own web presence, although the Office of Communications and Marketing or Office of Information Technology reserves the right to remove or edit content at any time. The director or chair has responsibility over the content of that area, but may delegate web management to someone else. Each area is responsible for the following: 
    1. Creating and maintaining up-to-date and accurate content related to the area’s personnel and activities. Site content should be reviewed at least once each semester, or as often as necessary to maintain accuracy and relevance of all content, and to ensure that links are accurate and working.
    2. Designating a dedicated point person to manage and edit web content within the area’s website.
    3. Abiding by best practices outlined in these policies and in the online web tutorials.
    4. Attending website training sessions as needed.
  2. User Permissions. 
    1. Top level sites, such as the homepage and “About” section, are managed by the Office of Communications and Marketing.
    2. When a web editor leaves College employment, his or her permission will be immediately removed from the site database by the Office of Information Technology, and all editing permissions will be revoked.
    3. When a web editor leaves the office and dept or changes positions, the editing permissions will be immediately adjusted as appropriate by the manager(s) of that website. Web managers should check their site’s users every semester.
    4. Top-level managers should have “administrator” or “editor” permissions. Student workers should have permissions that expire at the end of their employment. Content published by GAs and other students must be routinely checked by a full-time employee.
    5. All users must use their Wagner College username and password to access the site. A Wagner College All-Access Pass is required for editing wagner.edu, faculty.wagner.edu, or students.wagner.edu.
  3. Top Pages. 
    1. All requests for changes to the homepage, header, footer, “About” pages, Events Calendar, or Newsroom must be submitted to the Office of Communications and Marketing.
    2. Priorities for the homepage are based on the size of the intended audience and the relevance to the College’s top website priorities.
    3. All links from the College homepage must stay on the wagner.edu or wagnerathletics.com domains.



### Content

  1. Keep it fresh. 
    1. Content must be centralized in the correct department or office website. If other websites refer to that information, they must link to the centralized location instead of copying the information. For example, instead of uploading a Campus Map to the Art Department’s site, that site should link to the Campus Map in the centralized Visit Campus section. This keeps all content current and correct.
    2. Content on all subsites must be current and relevant. Outdated information must be updated as soon as possible, or removed if the page is obsolete. The website should be a hub of up-to-date content, not an archive of old material. 
      1. When a page needs updating, instead of creating a new page with the current information and removing the outdated page, the existing page should be updated.
      2. The URLs for those pages should not include dates. This will keep links across wagner.edu working correctly.
      3. For example, the page for ILC courses should be updated at wagner.edu/academics/undergraduate/ilc/courses, NOT wagner.edu/academics/undergraduate/ilc/fall-2012-courses.
    3. Old files in the Media Library must be removed on a regular basis, so they do not appear in search queries.
    4. Links must be checked regularly (at least once a semester) to make sure they are working correctly.
  2. Keep it clean. 
    1. Wagner College will not tolerate offensive or abusive content on wagner.edu or any online platforms. Content that is deemed inappropriate will be removed immediately, and the user responsible for that content will have web permissions revoked. Additional disciplinary actions may occur according to the policies in the employee, faculty and student handbooks.
    2. Copy should be written with the audience in mind, in a positive and friendly manner. Use of second person is acceptable and encouraged. Informal and approachable language, without being overly chatty, welcomes visitors to our site and encourages engagement. Use short sentences and paragraphs of no more than 3-4 sentences, with a full break in between.
    3. Layouts must align with the provided templates, shortcodes, and styles. For example, provided headings must be used instead of an image file of large text.
    4. Video must be embedded via the BrightCove platform.
    5. All copy must conform to high editorial standards, with proper spelling, punctuation, grammar, style, etc.
    6. Do NOT WRITE IN ALL CAPS. EVER.
  3. Keep it accessible. 
    1. All Wagner College web pages must comply with state and federal accessibility standards.
    2. Write meaningful link text.
    3. Include descriptive alt text for photos
  4. Keep it legal. 
    1. When uploading or posting confidential information, web editors must be extremely cautious. PDFs and other files are searchable and not private unless protection is specifically applied.
    2. Wagner College must have copyright ownership or permission for all content, including text, photographs, maps, graphics, files, and other data. Web editors may not upload or publish any content that does not meet copyright criteria. For example, a photograph found with Google search cannot be downloaded and published on wagner.edu without express permission from the photographer or owner of the photograph.



Section IV: Policies for Daily Bulletin email

The Daily Bulletin is Wagner College’s daily email newsletter.

In the very first issue — dated Oct. 12, 2010 — we explained why we were introducing an email newsletter to the campus community:  _In response to requests from the Student Government Association for a reduction in the number of emails, we are consolidating as many as possible of the daily administrative notices to the campus community into a single daily bulletin. Feel free to let us know if you feel this helps or hinders campus communications.  _

The Daily Bulletin is laid out so that you get more information at the top about events coming up in the next week, and about newly announced events. At the end, you get summary listings and dates for everything happening later in the semester.

Ideally, you should be able to scan the listings in the Daily Bulletin in 20 seconds or less. If you see a headline that interests you, you can read a very brief description of the event — just enough to help you determine whether you want more information, which you’ll get by hitting the “hot link” at the end.

_**If you take just 20 seconds each morning to scan the Daily Bulletin before hitting “delete,” you will not miss anything important happening at Wagner College.** ** **_

Here’s what’s contained in an average issue of the Daily Bulletin:

  * **At the top,  **a brief description of and link to the Photo of the Day feature on our Facebook, along with other special announcements.
  * **‘Next 7 days’ —  **Listings, dates and descriptions of campus and Wagner-related events coming up in the next 7 days, usually including links to Web pages containing more detailed information about the events.
  * **‘Recently announced events’ —  **Here’s where announcements often appear for the first time in the Daily Bulletin, particularly if they are scheduled for more than 1 week after that day’s issue. Listings here include dates, descriptions and links for further details.
  * **‘Featured events’ —  **Once a week, we’ll include here extended listings of the most important campus events that are still more than 7 days away.
  * **‘Miscellanea’ —  **This section is for ongoing announcements about student services, award & scholarship contests, etc.
  * **‘Later this month’ —  **In this final section are bullet-point listings of all the upcoming events for the current semester in our Daily Bulletin files that are scheduled for more than 1 week from the current date. This listing contains only event names and dates. Once these events draw to within the “Next 7 Days” range, they’re moved up, and they are listed along with fuller (although brief) descriptions and links for further information.



If you have an upcoming campus or Wagner-related event that you want to publicize to the campus community, the Daily Bulletin is the single most effective medium for you to use. We’ll include any event that’s either happening on campus or sponsored by or related to a campus office, academic department, student club, class or professor.

**One note:**  The Daily Bulletin does not publish announcements about all local, off-campus events that may be of interest to the Wagner College community. Events announced in the Daily Bulletin must have a clear, direct connection to Wagner College — in other words, the events must be happening on campus, or be sponsored by a campus office, academic department, student club, class or professor.

When you send in a Daily Bulletin submission, please include:

  * Event name
  * Date
  * Time
  * Location (including room number)
  * Brief description of the event (1 or 2 sentences — make ’em count!)
  * Email address of someone to contact for more information
  * Any link you have to a website containing more, relevant information about the event



If you send in an announcement about an upcoming campus or Wagner-related event, we will include an extended listing (event name, date, brief description and info links) in the next day’s Bulletin, either in the “Next 7 Days” or the “Recently Announced Events” sections. If the event is still more than a week away the following day, it will be moved down into the “Later This Month” bullet-point list (with event name and date only) — but when the event comes back into the 1-week window, the extended listing will run again, in the “Next 7 Days” section.

So, do you have an event you want included in the Daily Bulletin? Or just a question? In either case, send it in to Daily Bulletin editor Lee Manchester (lee.manchester@wagner.edu).
