        <p><b>1. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY.</b><br>
        This privacy policy tells you how we collect, use, and protect your
        personal information. By visiting our website, you accept and agree to
        the terms and conditions of this privacy policy. In particular, you
        consent to our collection and use of your personal information as
        described in this privacy policy.<br>
        <br>
        <b>2. MINORS.</b><br>
        We do not provide services or sell products to children. If you are
        below the age of 18, you may use our website only with the permission
        and active involvement of a parent or legal guardian. If you are a
        minor, please do not provide us or other website visitors with any
        personal information.<br>
        <br>
        <b>3. POLICY IS PART OF OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE.</b><br>
        Our privacy policy is part of, and subject to, our website's terms and
        conditions of use. You may view these terms and conditions on our
        website.<br>
        <br>
        <b>4. THE TYPE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU.</b><br>
        Like most places on the Internet, simply by visiting our website you
        automatically tell us certain information. This includes basic
        information such as your IP address, when you visited, the website from
        where you came prior to visiting us, the website where you go when you
        leave our website, your computer's operating system, and the type of web
        browser that you are using. Our website automatically records this basic
        information about you.</p>
        <p>And like many other websites, we may use cookies. In plain English,
        this means information that our website's server transfers to your
        computer. This information can be used to track your session on our
        website. Cookies may also be used to customize our website content for
        you as an individual. If you are using one of the common Internet web
        browsers, you can set up your browser to either let you know when you
        receive a cookie or to deny cookie access to your computer.</p>
        <p>We may also collect any data that you provide us by posting it at our
        website or by e-mail. You can always choose not to provide us with
        information. However, if you do withhold information, we may deny you
        access to some or all of our website's services and features.</p>
        <p>Some transactions between you and our website may involve payment by
        credit card, debit card, checks, money orders, and/or third party online
        payment services. In such transactions, we will collect information
        related to the transaction as part of the course of doing business with
        you, including your billing address, telephone number, and other
        information related to the transaction.<br>
        <br>
        <b>5. WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION.</b><br>
        We use your information to operate our website's business activities.
        For example, we may use this data to contact you about changes to our
        website, new services, or special offers, resolve disputes, troubleshoot
        issues, and enforce our website's terms and conditions.</p>
        <p>As a general rule, we will not give your data to third parties
        without your permission. However, there are some important exceptions to
        this rule that are described in the following paragraphs.</p>
        <p>We may, in our sole discretion, provide information about you to law
        enforcement or other government officials for purposes of fraud
        investigations, alleged intellectual property infringement, or any other
        suspected illegal activity or matters that may expose us to legal
        liability.</p>
        <p>Although we do not disclose individually identifiable information, we
        may disclose aggregate data about our website's visitors to advertisers
        or other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes.</p>
        <p>From time to time, we may use third party suppliers to provide
        services on our website. If a supplier wants to collect information
        about you, you will be notified. However, you will never be required to
        give information to a third party supplier. We restrict the way third
        party suppliers can use your information. They are not allowed to sell
        or give your information to others.<br>
        <br>
        <b>6. USER NAMES AND PASSWORDS.</b><br>
        Your access to parts of our website may be protected by a user name and
        a password. Do not give your password to anyone. If you enter a section
        of our website that requires a password, you should log out when you
        leave. As a safety precaution, you should also close out of your web
        browser completely and re-open it before viewing other parts of the
        Internet.<br>
        <br>
        <b>7. YOUR USE OF INFORMATION AND UNSOLICITED JUNK E-MAIL.</b><br>
        If you obtain personally identifiable information about another website
        user, you are not allowed to disclose this information to anyone else
        without the consent of the user and our consent too.</p>
        <p>We hate junk e-mail (Spam). Information you obtain from our website
        about us or other site users cannot be used by you or others to send
        unsolicited commercial e-mail or to send unsolicited commercial
        communications via our website's posting or other communication systems.<br>
        <br>
        <b>8. YOUR VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES WHO ARE
        NOT OUR SUPPLIERS.</b><br>
        You may choose to provide personal information to website visitors or
        other third parties who are not our suppliers. Please use caution when
        doing so. The privacy policies and customs of these third parties
        determine what is done with your information.<br>
        <br>
        <b>9. AUTORESPONDERS.</b><br>
        We may use autoresponders to communicate with you by e-mail. To protect
        your privacy, we use a verified opt-in system for such communications
        and you can always opt-out of such communications using the links
        contained in each autoresponder message. If you have difficulties opting
        out, you may contact us by sending an e-mail to admin@dotcomsuccess.com,
        or sending us mail to the address listed below.<br>
        <br>
        <b>10. POLICY CHANGES.</b><br>

        are made, we will notify you by a notice posted on our website's home
        page of the changes that have been made. If you disagree with the
