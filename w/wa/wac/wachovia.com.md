### How We Gather Customer Information

The information we gather about you helps us to better understand your financial needs and to provide more personalized, efficient service to you.  For example, this information may prompt us to suggest overdraft protection for your checking account, or recommend an investment product.

The information we gather comes from a variety of sources, including:

  * Information you provide to us (such as name, address and telephone number). 
  * Information about your transactions with Wachovia (such as account balance and payment history).
  * Information we receive from credit reporting agencies and other companies and agencies (such as your credit history). 



### Sharing Customer Information Within Wachovia Corporation

  * Credit information received from you or others (such as information from your credit application or your employment or credit history) to evaluate your eligibility for various financial services (for example, a home equity loan at a special rate).

### Your Privacy Choices at Wachovia

Because we recognize that you may wish to limit the ways in which we contact you for marketing purposes, we offer the following options.   You can choose not to be contacted for marketing purposes by:

  1. Telephone
  2. Direct Mail
  3. E-mail



You also have a choice about how credit information about you is shared within Wachovia.  If you prefer that we not share credit information about you with Wachovia companies, you may choose the following option:

  4. Do not share credit information about me that you receive from me or others among Wachovia companies.



However, even if you prefer that we not share credit information about you, we still may share information about your transactions with us among Wachovia companies.

 **Note:** If you are comfortable with the ways in which we contact you currently, there is no need to indicate your preferences.  To discuss your options, inform us of a preference, or provide us with feedback, call us at (866) 203-5722 (Command Asset Program, IRA, Brokerage and Insurance customers should call (877) 358-1114), visit a Wachovia Financial Center or visit us on the web at [wachovia.com/privacy](http://www.wachovia.com/privacy).

Whatever your preferences, we will honor your wishes and respect your privacy. Your preferences will remain in effect until you tell us otherwise. You do not need to notify us if you have already indicated your preferences to us.  If you contact us, we will assume your preferences apply to you only— unless you tell us that they also apply to other individuals listed on your accounts.

Please note that we are committed to providing you with superior service. We may contact you to resolve a problem or to service your accounts even if you have asked us not to contact you for marketing purposes. For example, if we notice unusual activity on your credit card, we may contact you to verify your purchases and confirm you authorized them.  If you choose not to be contacted by direct mail for marketing purposes, you will continue to receive the marketing information that accompanies your usual account mailings and statements.
