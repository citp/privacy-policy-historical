_**Please be aware that any information processed under this Policy may be transferred to or from another country or territory which provides different or less comprehensive privacy and/or security protections for the information.**_

Because of the global nature of our business, a cooperation among the Affiliates in the Wacom Group is established with respect to certain parts of the Services.  As a consequence, when certain information is shared within the Wacom Group, information relating to you might be processed outside of your local jurisdiction, including without limitation in the United States, the European Economic Area (EEA) and/or Japan.  All information collected and transferred under this Policy to other Affiliates in the Wacom Group will remain subject to this Policy and applicable data protection laws and regulations.

Also, many of our third party processors are based in different jurisdictions, including the United States, the EEA and/or Japan.  Information transferred to our processors will contractually be required to comply with the obligations set forth in this Policy.

Whenever we transfer your information out of the EEA to one of our processors, we will ensure that at least one of the following shall apply:  (i) the transfers will be to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission; (ii) we have used specific model contracts approved by the European Commission which are intended to give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; (iii) where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer information to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US; or (iv) any alternative transfer mechanism that can under GDPR lawfully support the transfer.  Please contact us as provided for in this Policy if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.

_**By your use of the Services and acknowledgement of our Privacy Policy, you consent to your information being transferred to and processed by Wacom, the Wacom Group, Wacom’s service providers and third parties outside the EEA.**_

**7.     ****Security; Breach; PCI DSS**

Wacom takes reasonable and appropriate precautions to help protect your information, taking into due account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the information.However, given the nature of the internet and the fact that network security measures are not infallible, we cannot guarantee the security of your information.

When registering for access to a secure area of one of our Services, we will ask you to select a username and password. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email.  Also, remember to sign out of the Service and close your browser window, your software, application or other Service when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your information and correspondence when accessing your computer.

When you make a payment at our Websites, we comply with our obligations under the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and we ensure that any third party service providers to our Services who process customer credit cards also comply with the requirements set forth in the PCI DSS.

Any sharing of your information with third party processors who are operating at our instruction will be made in accordance with applicable data protection laws.  These third party processors will be required to comply with appropriate security and breach notification measures to protect your information.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
