      privacy of visitors to our site. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully 
      so that you understand our privacy practices. 
      </font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">Questions regarding privacy issues should be directed to Cox 
      Interactive Media at <a href="mailto:pbrown@cimedia.com">pbrown@cimedia.com</a>. 
      </font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">Children should always get permission from their parents before sending 
      any information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, 
      and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. We won't 
      knowingly allow anyone under 13 to register with any of our sites or to 
      provide any other personally identifying information. 
      </font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">The information gathered by Cox Newspapers, Inc. falls into two 
      categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to our 
      websites when they register or initiate transactions, and (2) tracking 
      information gathered as visitors navigate through our sites. Third party 
      providers featured on or linked to by our websites, such as vendors of 
      products and services offered through our sites, may be gathering the same 
      kinds of information. 
      </font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">To make use of certain features on our websites (such as free email, 
      personal web pages, chatrooms and other interactive forums) visitors need 
      to register and to provide certain information as part of the registration 
      process. We may also ask for information from those who buy products or 
      services or conduct other transactions on our websites. (We may ask, for 
      example, for your name, email address, sex, age, zip code or credit card 
      number, and we might request information on your interest in sports, 
      personal finance, the performing arts, and the like.) The information you 
      supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our 
      sites to your interests and make them more useful to you, and to process 
      e-commerce transactions. 
      </font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">The more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you. 
      Supplying such information is entirely voluntary. But if you don't supply 
      the information we need, we may be unable to provide you with services we 
      make available to other visitors to our sites. For example, we can't offer 
      you a personalized stock portfolio if you don't tell us which stocks you 
      want to track. And we can't send you email alerting you to a new service 
      we're offering, or breaking news that may interest you if you don't tell 
      us what you're interested in and give us your email address. 
      </font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">From time to time, we may offer contests, sweepstakes or other 
      promotions on our sites. If you enter one of these promotions, you'll have 
      to provide information about yourself (such as your name, address, 
      telephone number and email address) so that we can contact you if you win. 
      We may share this information with any co-sponsor of the promotion, which 
      we will identify in the official rules. If you don't want us to collect 
      the information requested in the registration form or to provide it to 
      contest co-sponsors, please do not enter the contest or sweepstakes.
      </font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">Of course, even if you want to remain completely anonymous, you're 
      still free to take advantage of the wealth of content available on our 
      sites without registration. 
      </font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">To help make our sites more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we 
      invoke a standard feature of browser software, called a "cookie," to 
      assign each visitor a unique, random number, a sort of user ID, if you 
      will, that resides on your computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify 
      the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. 
      Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for 
      example), we won't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your 
      computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is 
      information you supply. A cookie can't read unrelated data off your hard 
      drive. Our advertisers and the third parties that provide products or 
      services through our sites may also assign their own cookies to your 
      browser, a process that we don't control. 
      </font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">We use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs, to deliver a 
      better, more personalized service. It is a cookie, for example, that 
      allows us to deliver your personalized stock quotes each time you visit a 
      site, even if you've been away for awhile. And we use cookies to avoid 
      showing you the same ad, repeatedly, during a single visit. In addition, 
      we may use cookies to track the pages on our sites visited by our users. 
      We can build a better site if we know which pages our users are visiting 
      and how often. Of course, you can set your browser not to accept cookies, 
      but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized 
      features enjoyed by other visitors to our sites. 
      </font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your 
      computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you 
      visit our sites. (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached 
      to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the web pages you 
      view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally to us. We use this 
      information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our 
      sites to the interests of our users, and to measure traffic within our 
      sites. 
      </font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">To make our sites more valuable to our visitors, we offer some features 
      in conjunction with other providers. Our chat and free email services, for 
      example, are made available through cooperative arrangements with 
      providers that specialize in operating such services. We share with these 
      third parties such information as is necessary to provide the products or 
      services. And, of course, our sites include links to plenty of other 
      websites, and provide access to products and services offered by third 
      parties, whose privacy policies we don't control. When you access another 
      website or purchase products or services or conduct other transactions 
      through our websites, use of any information you provide is governed by 
      the privacy policy of the operator of the site you're visiting or the 
      provider of such products or services. And when you provide information in 
      the course of obtaining products or services through one of our sites, use 
      of any information you provide may be governed by the privacy policy of 
      the provider of those products or services, even if it appears that you're 
      on CIM-branded pages throughout the transaction. The provider's privacy 
      policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any 
      of our provider partners via a link either from the site's homepage or 
      from the pages on which the products or services are offered, you should 
      contact the provider directly for more information. 
      </font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">When we present information to our advertisers -- to help them 
      understand our audience and confirm the value of advertising on our 
      websites -- it is usually in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic 
      to various pages within our sites. From time to time, we may share more 
      particularized information on visitors to our sites with those marketing 
      products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. Please 
      indicate on our registration form if you'd prefer we not share such 
      information with them. If you want to change your election (or to review, 
      update, or delete the information you provided on registering), just 
      return to the registration form, enter the changes you want to make, and 
      re-submit the form. All information gathered on any CIM website is 
      encrypted for storage within a CIM-controlled database. However, as 
      effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. 
      We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee 
      that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted 
      to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a 
      message you post to any chatroom, forum or other public posting area is 
      available to anyone with Internet access. If you don't want people to know 
      your email address, for example, don't include it in any message you post 
      publicly. 
      </font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">We may occasionally release information about our visitors when release 
      is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our Visitor Agreement, or to 
      protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our sites, the 
      public, or Cox Newspapers, Inc.. As our business grows, we may buy or 
      sell various assets. In the unlikely event that Cox Newspapers, Inc., the 
      bulk of our assets, or one or more of our sites is acquired by another 
      company, information on our visitors would be among the transferred 
assets.
      </font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">A final note: The Web is an evolving medium. If we need to change our 
      privacy policy at some point in the future, we'll post the changes before 
      they take effect. By visiting any of our sites, you agree that your visit, 
      and any dispute over our privacy practices, is governed by this Privacy 
      Policy and our Visitor Agreement.
