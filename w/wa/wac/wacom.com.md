**5\. Information We Collect**  
In general, the information we collect is of two types: (a) user information and (b) usage information. We also collect business account information and social media information from some persons under the circumstances described below.  
We collect information from you in several ways. You provide us with certain identifying information when you create a Wacom account or access our Services. We also collect certain information automatically as you interact with our Services. We may also receive information about you from other sources. We may collect personal information from you when you register as a user or to learn more about our products, request a demo or evaluation period, provide comments and suggestions, sign up for newsletters, enter competitions and promotions, interact with us on our social media channels, order Apps, products or services, request and utilize maintenance and support services, request white papers, sign up for events or seminars, submit content or send us feedback. ** _If you do not want us to collect this information, please do not provide it, but you may not be able to take advantage of our Services or certain features of our Services._** For example, where we need to collect information to perform our contractual duties to you and you fail to provide that information when requested, we may not be able to provide you with the agreed-upon products or services. Examples of information we directly collect from you include:   
**User information.** This means information collected about users of the Services and includes contact information. It also includes any content you store on our Services, including requests, questions, comments or reviews you share with us or others who use our Services. “User information” also includes information that you provide to us to make purchases, such as payment information, identifiers, and delivery address. If you contact our customer support, the user information we collect will also include recordings of your communications with customer support.   
**Business account contact information.** This means business contact information such as name, title, job function, business name, business address, business e-mail address, and business phone number that we collect about people we serve or work with, including actual and prospective customers, alliance and channel partners, contractors, vendors and other parties interested in Wacom or its products and services.  
**Usage Information.** We collect information about your interactions with our services. This includes or can relate to your personal information. This information enables us to, among other things, improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular and count visits, provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests and to analyze trends, administer our websites, track how you engage with our websites and other Services, learn about the systems, browsers, and apps you use to interact with our Services, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We also use analysis tools and methods to allow us to better understand how our customers use our Services. This includes how often the Services are used, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, any exceptions that occur within the software and the source from which the application was downloaded.   
To do this, we use cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, to help us collect this information. Our collection and processing of cookies is described in greater detail in our Cookie Notice which may be found [here](https://web.archive.org/en-us/cookie-notice). We also compile certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes information such as: 

• internet protocol (IP) addresses   
• browser type,   
• browser language,   
• device identifier,   
• device type,   
• internet service provider (ISP),   
• referring/exit pages,   
• length of visit,   
• pages viewed,   
• operating system,   
• date/time stamp,   
• clickstream data,   
• crashes,   
• system activity,   
• hardware settings,   
• time zone,   
• the date and time of requests, and   
• referral URL 

We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. If you reach out to us over the telephone or via facsimile, we may also log information such as your phone number, forwarding calls, SMS routing information, and types of calls.  
**Social media information.** If you choose to login to our Services using social media accounts, we will receive your name, email address, and, generally, your social media identifier (sometimes also referred to as a user name or handle). We also sometimes receive, when the platform allows, your profile images and historical information about your interaction with our social media presences. We also monitor social media sites for engagement with our products and services, particularly including our social media presence. We may receive, consistent with the privacy practices of the social media platforms that we monitor, public information about interactions (such as retweets, re-posts, likes, and other reactions) with our social media platform, mentions of our products or services, information about our social medial followers, and information sent to us in direct messages or replies. When you send us direct message or replies, we receive and process any personal information in those message. So, for instance, if you mention that you received one of our products for your birthday, we would receive and store that information as part of our records of our support interactions with you.  
We also use third-party social media tools to identify journalists and influencers relevant to our products and services. These tools may provide public biographical information on journalists and influencers. We use this information to make information about our products and services available to influencers, to measure the impact of influencers’ own social media profiles, and to communicate with influencers about our products.   
**Other third-party information.** We receive information about you from third parties who support our Services including our payment processor, third-party marketplaces, and our sales channel partners. We may add this third-party-provided information to the information we collect on you from our Websites.

**9\. International Transfers of Data for Processing.**  
Please be aware that any information processed under this Policy may be transferred to or from another country or territory which provides different or less comprehensive privacy and/or security protections for the information.  
Because of the global nature of our business, a co-operation among the Affiliates in the Wacom Group with respect to certain parts of the Services is established. As a consequence, when certain information is shared within the Wacom Group, information relating to you might be processed outside of your local jurisdiction, including without limitation in the United States, the European Economic Area (EEA) and/or Japan. All information collected and transferred under this Policy to other Affiliates in the Wacom Group will remain subject to this Policy and applicable data protection laws.  
Also, many of our third-party processors are based in different jurisdictions, including the United States, the EEA and/or Japan. Information transferred to our processors will contractually be required to comply with the obligations set forth in this Policy.   
Where we transfer your information to a country or territory which provides less comprehensive privacy and/or security protections for the information, we will continue to ensure that all such transfers of your information shall be performed in a manner compliant with applicable data protection laws.  
By your use of the Services and acknowledgement of our Privacy Policy, you consent to your information being transferred to and processed by Wacom, the Wacom Group, Wacom’s service providers and third parties outside of your local jurisdiction.

**10\. Third-party Features and Websites**  
As stated above, the Websites may contain links to or features from other websites. This Policy covers the processing of information by Wacom for our Services, and does not cover the processing of information by such third-party websites or features. Wacom is not responsible for the privacy policies, cookie policies, terms of use and/or practices of third parties that you have accessed from our Services. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Services and to read the privacy policy, cookie policy, terms of use and other statements on that third-party site or for that third-party service.

**11\. Security; Breach; PCI DSS**  
Wacom takes reasonable and appropriate precautions to help protect your information. We believe that these precautions take into due account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the information. However, given the nature of the internet and the fact that network security measures are not infallible, we cannot guarantee the security of your information.   
When registering for access to a secure area of one of our Services, we will ask you to select a username and password. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also, remember to sign out of the Service and close your browser window, your software, application or other Service when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your information and correspondence when accessing your computer.  
When you make a payment at our Websites, we comply with our obligations under the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and we ensure that any third-party service providers to our Services who process customer credit cards also comply with the requirements set forth in the PCI DSS.  
Any sharing of your information with third-party processors who are operating at our instruction will be made in accordance with applicable data protection laws. These third-party processors will be required to comply with appropriate security and breach notification measures to protect your information.   
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.   
If you have any questions about the security of our Services, you can contact us using the contact information at the top of this policy.

Furthermore, you are entitled to request information about the personal information we store about you at any time. You may also request to correct, update or remove information about yourself at any time. For any such request you may contact us at the address shown at the top of this policy. If your information is provided to us by your employer, you should direct your requests to your employer.   
You will not have to pay a fee to access your information; however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.  
We will retain your information and the data we process on behalf of our customers as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we have collected the information, for as long as your Wacom account is active, as needed to provide you our Services or to comply with legal or regulatory obligations. We will retain and use this information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. If you delete any of your Wacom account information, we may retain certain information if required by law or for legitimate business purposes or to complete our contractual obligations to you.  
If you become an inactive customer, or if we close or suspend your Wacom account, we will continue to adhere to the then current Policy when we collected your information so long as we retain it in our possession. We may delete any or all of your information at any time without notice to you for any reason or no reason unless otherwise required by law or contract to retain it.   
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that your information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.   
We will attempt to respond to any request to access your information within 30 days. It may take us longer if your request is complex or you have made multiple requests in which circumstances we will notify you and keep you apprised of our progress.

**13\. Preferences and Opting-Out**  
Our Services provide visitors and customers the opportunity to opt-out of receiving specific types of communications from us and our partners at the point where we request information about the visitor or customer. In addition, if you have previously signed up to receive information about our Services, you may unsubscribe or opt out of all future marketing communications from us that do not relate to products or services you have already ordered by removing your contact and other information from our marketing and communications databases by (a) e-mailing us or (b) clicking the unsubscribe link on any email marketing communication you receive.
