3.1 What are cookies?

“Cookies” are small text files that are stored by your web browser on your computer's hard drive. They allow the Websites to store such things as user preferences. The Websites use both session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are temporary cookies that expire (and are automatically erased) when you close your browser. Persistent cookies usually have an expiration date far into the future and thus stay in your browser until they expire, or until you delete them.

Cookies are useful because they help make your Website experience more enjoyable. They allow us to recognise your device (e.g. your laptop or mobile device) so that your experience of our Websites can be tailored to your device. Cookies do not typically identify you as an individual, just the device you are using. We use cookies to save information such as passwords and preferences so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our Website, to deliver content tailored to your interests and to optimise the performance of our Website. The information connected with the cookie can also be visitors' preferences and to record session information, such as pages visited, interactions with website features, time spent on our Website and language preference.

We use the following types of cookies:

_Strictly necessary cookies_ _– which enable Services you have specifically asked for_

We use certain cookies which are essential to the operation of our Websites. For example, these types of cookies enable you to log into secure areas of our Websites, provide the necessary security your visit to our Websites requires, and help ensure the content of the pages you request load quickly. Without these cookies, Services that you have asked for cannot be provided as required. 

We want you to understand these essential cookies, and why we use them, but we don't need to get your consent to use them on our Websites as we use these cookies only to provide you with Services that you have requested.
