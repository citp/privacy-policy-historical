# Privacy | Wacom

Last Updated: 12 October 2015

This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and shared by Wacom Technology Corporation ("Wacom," "we," or "us"). This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our website and online products and services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us. 

  * **1\. Information Collection and Use**  
We collect information from our users at several different points on our Services. 
    * **Information that Is Automatically Collected when You Use the Services**  
We automatically collect anonymous, aggregate information when you access or use our Services. We store information that we collect through log files to create a profile of our users. Log files record internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track a customer's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. A profile stores information detailing how individual customers use our Services. This information is used to (a) provide, maintain and improve our Services; (b) monitor and analyze website trends, administer the website, track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use; (c) link or combine with information we get from others to help understand your needs and provide you with better service; and (d) carry out any other purpose for which the information was collected. 
    * **Information that Is Collected by Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's hard drive containing information about that user. Cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Services, and provide advertisements, content or features that match user profiles or interests. For more information about how Wacom uses Cookies and your choices regarding Cookies, please see our Cookie policy here. 
    * **Information You Submit to Wacom**  
We collect information you provide to us. For example, we collect information when you create an account, participate in any interactive features of the Services, make a purchase, apply for a job, communicate with us via third party social media sites, register products you purchase from us, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your name, address, phone number, email address, gender, ethnicity, veteran status, disability status, information regarding product you purchased, purchase transaction and any other information you choose to provide. We may use information you submit for various purposes, including to: (a) communicate with you by sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and administrative messages; (b) respond to your comments, questions and requests and provide customer service; (c) fulfill and deliver your products and services orders, process transactions and send you related information; and (d) carry out any other purpose for which the information was collected. We use a third party payment processor to process purchase transactions. We do not collect or store financial information, such as credit card number or other payment methods. 
    * **Information We Collect from Other Sources**  
We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example, if you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site.
    * **Tell-A-Friend**  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our website, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. We will automatically send the friend an email inviting him/her to visit the website. We store this information for the purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact us to request the removal of this information from this database. 
    * **Promotions and News**  
We may use information about you to communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, and events offered by Wacom and others, and provide news and information we think will be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from us by following the instructions in those emails or by deactivating it within your My account/Manage profile/Manage preferences. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.
    * **Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others**  
We may allow others to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics services. These entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by us and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites and better understand your online activity.
