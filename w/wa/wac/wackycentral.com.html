      <p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana" size="5">Privacy Policy</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana">The following describes the Privacy Policy for our 
      http://WackyCentral.com website.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Your Privacy</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Your privacy is important to us at 
      WackyCentral.com. 
      To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our 
      online information practices and the choices you can make about the way 
      your information is collected and used. You agree to agree to these 
      policies by virtue of using our website in a way that leads to you 
      providing us with personal information.<br>
      <br>
      <b>State Law &amp; Accompanying Rights</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Please understand that you may have additional 
      rights originating from State laws based on where you live. These 
      State-based rights may augment, strengthen, or otherwise somehow 
      compliment any privacy rights you have inherently or under Federal law. 
      Our policy is to comply fully with the privacy policies of every 
      jurisdiction in which we operate. Accordingly, you are free to use our 
      Contact information to reach us at any time to assert any State rights.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Protecting the privacy of the very young is 
      especially important. For that reason, our website will never collect or 
      maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 
      18, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 18.<br>
      <br>
      Under our Terms of Service and Conditions of Use, children under 18 are 
      not allowed to use our website and access our services. It is not our 
      intention to offer products or services to minors.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Collection of Personal Information</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana">When visiting our website, the IP address used to 
      access our website may be logged along with the dates and times of access. 
      This information is purely used to analyze trends, administer our website, 
      track users movement, and gather broad demographic information for 
      internal use such as statistical assessments and website improvement. Most 
      importantly, any recorded IP addresses are not linked to personally 
      identifiable information.<br>
      <br>
      Other information may be collected as well by WackyCentral.com, which is 
      rather typical of most websites. For instance, the source that referred 
      you to our website is generally known. Likewise, your duration on our 
      website, and your destination when you leave our website can also be 
      tracked. Other common data collected includes the type of operating system 
      the computer you are using to access our website has. Similarly, the type 
      of web browser is often noted. Again, this is common data collection, and 
      helps ultimately produce a better end-user experience.<br>
      <br>
      Cookies are another common internet practice. Cookies are a key means of 
      improving user experience by allows us to customize your use of our 
      website. Simple information is transferred to your computer to allow the 
      content and experience at http://WackyCentral.com to reflect your actions, 
      preferences, and so on. You should simply make the assumption our website 
      uses cookies, and note that you are free to make adjustments in your web 
      browser to disable these or otherwise receive notification of cookies so 
      you can take whatever desired action you so choose. Please understand that 
      refusing cookies may cripple some of our website features and render some 
      aspects useless to you.<br>
      <br>
      At times, you will be fully aware of information received, as you are the 
      direct source providing it. For instance, you may comment on a blog post, 
      reply to an email (whether broadcast message or autoresponder), provide an 
      email address, complete a survey, requests SMS, or otherwise. Likewise, 
      purchases necessarily involve collecting certain information, such as 
      credit card information, Paypal addresses, your physical address for 
      billing and/or shipping, phone number, and so on. Refusing to provide some 
      of this information may lead to us being unable to provide you with the 
      products or services you’ve requested.<br>
      <br>
      A prime example of limited access to our website is where some http://WackyCentral.com 
      content may be protected by a username and password. Whether a username 
      and password is generated by our website, or created by you, these will 
      almost always be connected with some other information related to or 
      connected with you. This is true since much content that is protected on 
      the internet is subscription based, often paid for. Thus, the username and 
      password must necessarily be tied to your other account data. Usernames 
      and passwords, by their very nature, should be kept private. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Handling of Personal Information</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Note that any personal information you provide to 
      others apart from us or our vendors is wholly optional. As an example, you 
      might disclose something in a blog post comment. That “private” 
      information is now “public,” and we have no control over that. In like 
      fashion, you sharing information with any other third party not 
      functioning as a service provider to us puts that information beyond our 
      control and becomes subject to the policy that party has in place.<br>
      <br>
      Our primary intention for collecting personal and private information from 
      you is simply to conduct our business. We can use this internally to 
      better serve you. Accordingly, we see no reason to share your personal 
      information to other parties and outside interests unless you have 
      authorized us to do so. Of course, there are instances where your 
      information is stored with third party service providers, such as email 
      service providers, as they provide services that are industry-leading in 
      quality and security and are far more beneficial to our end user than 
      attempting such services “in-house.” However, you are never required to 
      deal with any such third party directly, they are limited in how they use 
      your information, and they cannot sell or transfer it to others in any 
      way.<br>
      <br>
      However, of course, your information does comprise part of an overall 
      whole. This aggregate of information, by contrast, may be used to 
      understand our overall user base. Further, we may share this information 
      about our website visitors as a whole, not individually, with third 
      parties for various purposes, in our sole discretion.<br>
      <br>
      While we are staunch privacy advocates at WackyCentral.com, there are times 
      when even we may be forced to abandon these ideals. Just as major search 
      engines face ongoing compulsion to provide data against their will, so too 
      may the same occur with our http://WackyCentral.com website. Illegal activity 
      or other serious acts or allegations could create legal liability for our 
      website. In those cases, we reserve the right to share your information, 
      or else may simply be compelled to do so by law. On the other hand, there 
      may be times when we would need to share your private information in order 
      to protect our own interests. For instance, in cases of suspected or 
      alleged copyright infringement or other intellectual property violations, 
      it may be necessary to share personal information.<br>
