HEY!

Consider running this dynamic script to generate the nav, and then saving it to a 
static file once you're happy with it.  It'll save server load bigtime.  :)

                      privacy policy. This policy applies only to information 
                      collected by waow.com and does not impact information collected 
                      or used by WAOW-TV, waow.com or their affiliates through 
                      other means.</p>
                    <p><strong>Information collected from users</strong></p>
                    <p>How we collect and retain information depends on the portion 
                      of the site you are accessing, the activities you elect 
                      to participate in and the services provided. You can visit 
                      many pages on our site without providing any information. 
                      Other pages may request you to provide information, such 
                      as when you register for access to portions of our site, 
                      request certain features, sign up for a newspaper subscription 
                      or make a purchase. You may also provide information when 
                      you participate in message boards, chat rooms and other 
                      interactive areas of our site.</p>
                    <p>Like many websites, waow.com also collects information 
                      automatically and through the use of electronic tools that 
                      may be transparent to our visitors. We may log the name 
                      of your Internet Service Provider or use "cookie" 
                      technology. As technology progresses, we may also gather 
                      information through other means. In some cases, you can 
                      choose not to provide us with information, for example by 
                      setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but doing 
                      so may limit your ability to access certain portions of 
                      the site or may require you to re-enter your user name and 
                      password. </p>
                    <p><strong>What we do with the information we collect</strong></p>
                    <p>We will use your information only as permitted by law. 
                      Aggregated Information (information that does not identify 
                      you personally) may be used in many ways. Aggregated Information 
                      may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business 
                      partners, but cannot be used to contact you individually.</p>
                    <p>We also collect information to enhance your visit and deliver 
                      more individualized content and advertising. For example, 
                      we may use Personally Identifiable Information collected 
                      on waow.com to communicate with you regarding our Terms 
                      of Website Use, products and services offered by waow.com, 
                      WAOW-TV and other affiliates and partners, administration 
                      of contests, processing e-commerce transactions and other 
                      topics we think you might find interesting. We reserve the 
                      right to share this information with other WAOW-TV business 
                      units and affiliates. This policy does not apply to any

                    <p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by waow.com

                      parties who provide technical support for the operation 
                      of our site may access such information.</p>
                    <p>We may also disclose your information in response to a 
                      court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably 
                      required to do so by law, in connection with the collection 
                      of amounts you may owe to us, and/or whenever we deem it 
                      appropriate or necessary to give such information to law 
                      enforcement authorities. We may not provide you with notice 
                      prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
                    <p><strong>Your choice to opt out</strong></p>
                    <p>The news and content on waow.com is supported by advertising 
                      revenue and a controlled program of e-mail marketing is 
                      an important element of our online publishing business. 
                      We sometimes permit our advertising and promotional partners 
                      to e-mail you about services, features, products, special 
                      offers and unique content we believe might interest you. 
                      If you prefer not to receive e-mail communications sent 
                      directly from our advertisers or promotional partners, you 
                      will be given an opportunity to decline before you provide 
                      us information we might use for this purpose. If you decline 
                      at the time you provide us such information, we will not 
                      share the Personally Identifiable Information you provide 
                      with non-Affiliated advertisers for such purposes, though 
                      we may on occasion send you information on their behalf.

                    <p>We strongly recommend parental supervision when a child 
                      uses the Internet, particularly when a child uses email.
