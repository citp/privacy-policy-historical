Your Privacy  
**Your Privacy**   
At Washington Mutual, respecting the privacy and security of your personal information is important to us. We know, however, that not everyone who takes their privacy seriously is necessarily well-versed in "legal or regulatory-ese." There are plenty of legal terms in Washington Mutual's own privacy policy, which you will find on the following pages. We urge you to read it carefully, and make note of your rights under this policy. We've tried to provide easy-to-understand explanations of the most frequently used legal terms -- terms we are required to use to ensure clarity and consistency. We want to make sure that your personal information is protected, and that you understand the policies that protect you. You'll find the same terms used in many companies' privacy policies. 

**Cookies & Browsers**  
This site uses a feature of your browser called a "cookie" to assign a "User I.D.". Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. Your Washington Mutual User ID automatically identifies your computer - but not you - to our servers when you visit wamu.com or other Washington Mutual Web sites. Unless you specifically tell us who you are (for example by completing an application), if you are just browsing our site, we will never know who you are even though we assign you a cookie. This site contains links to other sites. If you use a link to visit the site of another company, we cannot be responsible for the privacy practices or the content of that company or its site.

**Safeguarding Customer Information**  
We only grant access to nonpublic personal information about you (such as your name, address, social security number and credit history) to company employees and affiliated and non-affiliated service providers so that they can provide or offer products and services to you, process and service your accounts, and administer our business.

Our Code of Conduct requires that your information remain confidential. Even if you are no longer our customer, we will continue to treat your nonpublic personal information in the same way as if you were still a customer. In addition, we maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard this personal information. Some state laws may further restrict the sharing of your nonpublic personal information.

**Collection of Information**  
We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources: 

  * From you, on forms, via the Internet, by telephone or otherwise. Examples of this type of information include your name, address, social security number, credit history and other financial information.
  * From transactions with us, our affiliates or with others. For example, your payment histories, account balances, and other transaction records.
  * From credit reporting agencies, such as information relating to your creditworthiness, your credit score and credit usage.
  * From third parties to verify information you have given us.

**Uses of Shared Information**  
We may share all the information that we collect, as described above, for the following purposes: 

  * To provide you with the products and services you requested.
  * To offer you additional products and services, from us or from others, that may be of interest to you.
  * To comply with reporting and other legal requirements.
  * To otherwise conduct business.

**Information Sharing Among Our Family of Affiliated Companies***  
Washington Mutual, Inc. is the holding company for a group of companies which includes financial services providers such as depository institutions, insurance agencies, mortgage companies, consumer finance companies and securities broker-dealers. Any company that is owned or controlled by Washington Mutual, Inc. is an "affiliate" or an "affiliated company" of all of the other companies owned by Washington Mutual, Inc. 

Under the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, we are permitted to share your name, address and facts about your transactions and experience with us (such as your payment history and other transactions on your accounts with us) among our affiliated companies. That information is referred to in this Privacy Policy as "transaction information."

Unless you request otherwise, we also share all of the _other_ information we collect among our affiliated companies. This information - that is, information other than transaction and experience information - is referred to in this Privacy Policy as "other information." You have the right to ensure that other information is not shared with our affiliates. _If you don't want us to share this information with our affiliates, please call our Customer Contact Center at 800-533-3534 to opt out._

Once we receive your opt out request, we will stop sharing this information as soon as reasonably practical. Your opt out will apply to all accounts you hold individually and to all accounts you hold jointly with other persons. Your opt out will not apply, however, to any accounts your joint account holders hold individually or jointly with persons other than you. If your joint account holders wish to opt out as to such other accounts, they will need to submit a separate opt out request.

**Information Sharing with Nonaffiliated Third Parties as Permitted by Law**  
We are permitted by law to share all the information we collect, as described above, with (1) companies that perform marketing services on our behalf and (2) with other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing arrangements. For example, we may share information with financial services providers with which we offer products such as credit cards or accelerated loan payment programs.

We may also share all the information we collect, as described above, with other nonaffiliated third parties that assist us with preparing monthly statements and with the processing and printing of checks. These other nonaffiliated third parties also include credit reporting agencies to whom we report information about your transactions with us.

_Please be advised that the opt out rights described below will not apply to the sharing of information with these third parties or to the sharing of information with marketing service providers and joint marketers as described above._

**Information Sharing with Other Nonaffiliated Third Parties and Your Opt Out Rights**  
Unless you request otherwise, we may share all the information we collect, as described above, with additional types of nonaffiliated third parties, such as: 

  * Financial service providers, such as life insurance companies for whom one or more of our affiliates acts as agents.
  * Nonaffiliated companies, such as firms that offer value-added packages of products and services (including discounted travel services, discounted hotel accommodations and shopping services.)



_If you prefer that we not share nonpublic personal information with these nonaffiliated third parties, you may opt out of those disclosures (other than those permitted by law) by calling our Customer Contact Center at 800-533-3534._

We will stop sharing this information as soon as reasonably practical. Again, your opt out will apply to all accounts you hold individually and to all accounts you hold jointly with other persons. Your opt out will not apply, however, to any accounts your joint account holders hold individually or jointly with persons other than you. If your joint account holders wish to opt out as to such other accounts, they will need to submit a separate opt out request.

**Sharing of Nonpublic Personal Health Information**  
If you engage in an insurance transaction with or through us, we may collect nonpublic personal health information about you. We **do not** share nonpublic personal health information with any nonaffiliated third party unless you have authorized the disclosure, the disclosure is made in connection with an insurance transaction that was initiated by you or the disclosure is otherwise permitted by law.

**Your Opt-Out Options**  
If you wish to direct Washington Mutual to stop sharing certain nonpublic personal information about you with our affiliated companies and nonaffiliated third parties, please call our Customer Contact Center at 800-533-3534 to opt out, or you may send your instructions to Washington Mutual, PO Box 2430, Chatsworth, CA 91313-2430. **If you have previously opted out, you will _not_ need to do so again, unless you are establishing a new customer relationship with us.** _If you are calling to opt out of a newly established WM Financial Services relationship, please wait 10 days before calling to give us your opt out preferences. We will not share your nonpublic personal information (except as permitted by law) during this 10-day period._
