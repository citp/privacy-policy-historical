### Subscriptions

Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle").

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or K Production s.r.o. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through CCBill or Epoch account management page or by contacting K Production s.r.o. customer support team.

A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide our authorized sales agents with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information.
