# Watch Shop UK Privacy Policy

To contact us by email, please use the Contact us button at the top of the website.  


We never disclose any information submitted to us to 3rd parties for any reason.

We do not use any of your data for any reason but to successfully ship your order to you. 

We only store your name, address and telephone number if you register for an account with us.  This is entirely optional, but enables you to place further orders without having to enter your details again.

We use cookies to allow us to store only the information required to process a transaction.  E.g. items in your shopping basket.

We do NOT store your credit card information.  It is processed over a secure SSL/128 bit encryption system which goes through the payment provider Protx.  We do not even see it, therefore it cannot be ‘hacked’ from our server.

Optionally, you can supply us with a telephone number when ordering.  This is only used for emergency purposes if we are unable to contact you via email.

If you wish, you can contact us to have your profile deleted at any point in time.

All sensitive information is processed over a secure server.

We do not send marketing emails to random personal email address (spam), however from time to time we may send newsletters and special offers to registered customer email addresses. All of which include a facility for you to unsubscribe from such service by clicking on the link at the bottom.

All of our data collection and storage conforms to the requirements of the Data Protection Act, 1998.
