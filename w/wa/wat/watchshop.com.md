# Privacy Policy

Watch Shop operates a comprehensive policy for privacy and security. We aim to store the minimal amount of information possible to allow you to make purchases and offer you recommendations. 

We do not disclose, rent or lease any information submitted to us to 3rd parties for marketing purposes, except as stated in this policy. We do not use any of your data for any reason, except as stated in this policy, but to successfully ship your order to you. You have the option to sign up for an account in the checkout process. This means that your user data is stored on our servers. 

We may, sometimes, employ 3rd party companies for marketing purposes. In these cases, we may pass your name and email address on to a trusted 3rd party provider. Examples include sending e-mail newsletters, feedback requests and analysing data. The companies involved will not sell or lease your data, and will not market to you themselves. We make extensive efforts to ensure that any provider who receives your details operates a secure privacy policy so that your details will not be redistributed.

We store your name, address and telephone number if you register for an account with us.  This is optional, but enables you to place further orders without having to enter your details again. Your details are also stored in relation to unregistered orders.
