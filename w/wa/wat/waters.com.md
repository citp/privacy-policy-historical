# Waters - Privacy Statement

Waters Technologies Corporation d/b/a Waters Corporation ("WATERS") is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. We've structured our web site so that, in general, you can visit us on the Web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information.

Once you choose to provide us personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified), you can be assured that it will only be used to support your customer relationship with WATERS. 

**Awareness**

WATERS provides this Online Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy policy, practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. 

**What we collect**

On portions of our web site, you can order certain products or services, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are name, contact and billing information, transaction, and credit card information.

In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services (including registration), we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products, and more detailed contact preferences. 

**How we use it**

WATERS uses your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction, to communicate back to you, to update you on service and benefits, and to personalize our web sites for you. 

From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing information we think would be of particular interest. At a minimum, we will always give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving such direct marketing or market research contact. We will also follow local requirements, such as allowing you to opt in before receiving unsolicited contact, where applicable. 

**Who we share it with**

WATERS will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information to others. Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we will only share the personal data you provide online with other WATERS entities and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf for market research. Such WATERS entities and/or business partners, including those in the United States and/or any other countries, are governed by our privacy policies with respect to the use of this data and are bound by the appropriate confidentiality agreements.

Data collected online may also be combined with information you provide when you register your ownership of WATERS products.

**Choice**

WATERS will not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first letting you know and offering you a choice. As previously stated, we will also provide you the opportunity to let us know if you do not wish to receive unsolicited direct marketing materials from us and we will do everything we can to honor such requests. Local country laws and policies are applied where they differ from those in the U.S. 

**Accuracy & Access **

Certain areas of WATERS' web sites may limit access to specific individuals through the use of passwords and through providing personal data. WATERS strives to keep your personally identifiable information accurate. We will provide you with access to your information, including online access to your registration data so that you may view, update or correct your information at the WATERS site where it was submitted. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make corrections. Links to third party web sites on the site are provided solely as a convenience to you. If you use these links, you will leave the WATERS site. WATERS has not reviewed all of these third party sites and does not control and is not responsible for any of these sites, their content or their privacy policy. Thus, WATERS does not endorse or make any representations about them, or any information, software or other products or materials found there, or any results that may be obtained from using them. If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked to this site, you do so at your own risk.

**Security**

WATERS is committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We use encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information. 

**WATERS uses cookies**

A cookie is a piece of text placed on your computer that allows the Water's web site to remember who you are during your visit and when you return. If you allow your browser to accept cookies, then your browser adds the text in a small file. Cookies allow a web application to respond to you as an individual. By gathering and remembering information about your preferences, the web application can tailor its operation to your needs, likes and dislikes. For example, when you visit an electronic store, a cookie makes it easy to shop by allowing you to drop things into a shopping cart; the cart itself is not the cookie, the cookie consists of places on your hard drive and keeps track of your cart versus others' in use at the same time. 

You may set your web browser (Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator) to notify you of cookie placement requests or decline cookies completely. You can delete the files that contains cookies; those files are stored as part of your internet browser.
