## Introduction

We at FOX SPORTS StreamCo Pty Limited ("Company", "us" or "we") respect your concerns about privacy. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") applies to any information relating to you obtained by us in respect of the Watch NRL products, including through the Watch NRL websites and applications (collectively, the "Service").

This Policy describes the types of personal information we obtain about customers, website visitors and people that express an interest in the Service, how we use the personal information and with whom we share it. We also describe the measures we take to protect the security of your information and how you can contact us about our privacy practices.

We obtain personal information about customers, website visitors and people that express an interest in the Service either through the Serviceand from our Company affiliates.

We collect your personal information to offer the Service that you have requested or services that we have a legitimate interest to believe are of interest to our customers, to manage the relationship we have with our customers and partners, and to perform activities based on your consent.

From time to time, we may rely on our legitimate business interests to use your information to promote the Service or our Company affiliates’ products or services. We consider that if you have demonstrated an interest in the Service, you may also be interested in our other products or services.

We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal information (such as information related to racial or ethnic origin, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Service or otherwise. If, contrary to this request, you do provide any sensitive information, in doing so you consent to us collecting and handling that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## Interest-Based Advertising

On our sites, apps and/or emails we and our third-party service providers may obtain information about your activities to provide you with advertising about our products and services tailored to your individual interests. Our third-party service providers also may obtain information for this purpose from third-party websites and apps. This section of our Privacy Policy provides details and explains how to exercise your choices.

We engage third-party advertising networks to help us target our messaging to visitors through interest-based and contextual means on limited third party applications or websites. Through these ad networks, we can track your online activity on our Service over time by obtaining information through automated means, as described above. The networks use this information to show you advertisements on third-party websites and apps that may be tailored to your individual interests (for example, they might show you an advertisement for the Service if you have visited our site but have not acquired a subscription). The information our ad networks may obtain on our behalf includes data about your visits to websites and use of apps that serve our advertisements, such as the pages or ads you view and the actions you take on those websites or apps. This data collection takes place both on our sites, apps and emails and on third-party websites and apps that participate in these ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.

## SMS/MMS Advertising

By supplying us with your mobile phone number (which is optional), you consent to receive text message alerts from the Company containing product/service and event information or promotions that may be sent using automated dialing systems ("Text Messages").

You may not consent to receive Text Messages on behalf of someone else or provide someone else’s phone number. We will inform you about how to opt-out of Text Messages at the time we send it to you, or you may contact us as outlined in the _"How to Contact Us"_ section.

## Information We Share

  * Our subsidiaries and affiliates, any of whom may use your personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy or for the subsidiary’s or affiliate’s own purposes, including marketing purposes if you have consented to such use. A current list of our affiliated companies is available at [http://newscorp.com/about/our-businesses/](https://newscorp.com/about/our-businesses/).
  * The NRL as partners in the Service;

We require our service providers to protect the confidentiality and security of personal information, and to ensure that personal information is processed only for the provision of services on our behalf and in compliance with applicable law. Service providers are not authorised to use or disclose personal information, except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements.

We may further disclose information about you (1) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (2) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, and (3) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity.

In certain circumstances, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal information, restrict the processing of your personal information and exercise your right to data portability.

If you think we have breached the Privacy Act or other applicable privacy laws, you may complain to us by contacting us as outlined in the "How to Contact Us" section below. When you contact us, please include your email address, name, address, and telephone number and clearly describe your complaint. We will need to share your information with others who can assist in responding to your complaint.

## How We Protect And Retain Your Information

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information we have about you against accidental, unlawful or unauthorised destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. We make reasonable efforts to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of the processing, taking into account the costs of implementation and nature of the processing of personal information.

We retain personal information for the period needed to fulfill the purposes for which personal information was collected (including for all periods to which you are a subscriber to the Service) and as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law, such as in relation to our record retention obligations. If you are no longer an active customer, we will continue to hold your personal information to allow a simpler re-subscribe process and to allow us to communicate with you about special offers or encourage you to re-subscribe. We will generally keep your information for a shorter period if you have opted out of receiving communications from us.

## Data Transfers

The Service may be hosted in and managed from a country outside the country in which you initially provided the information (e.g Australia or the EU), including the United States. If you are based in Australia, you consent to having any personal information accessible from or transmitted outside of Australia.

When your personal information is transferred to (or accessed from) a country outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") for which the European Commission has not issued an adequacy decision, we will implement appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal information remains protected. This may include data transfer agreements, a copy of which you can obtain by contacting us as indicated in the "How To Contact Us" Section below.

However, your personal information may be accessed by the courts, law enforcement and national security authorities of the recipient country in accordance with applicable law. When we transfer your personal information, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Links to Third-Party Sites, Apps and Service

For your convenience and information, our Service may provide links to third-party sites, apps and services that may be operated by companies not affiliated with FOX SPORTS StreamCo Pty Limited.
