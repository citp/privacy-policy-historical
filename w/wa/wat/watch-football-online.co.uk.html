		<p><em>Effective April 1, 2007</em></p>
		<p> <br>
            <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> </p>
		<p><br>
		  TVProcessing provides  this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the  collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of  TVProcessing sites.  This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through our  Sites. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you  of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are  advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes. <br>
		  As used in this policy,  the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on acomputer,  subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or  touching information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting,  storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and  transferring information within the United States or internationally. </p>
		<p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong> </p>
		<p><br>
		  Our primary goals in  collecting information are to provide and improve our services, features and  content, to administer your Membership (together, the “<strong>Service</strong>”) and to enable users to  enjoy and easily navigate the Site.&nbsp; We also may also use your information  in order to better understand how our Site and Service are used.</p>
		<p><u>Personally  Identifiable Information. </u> </p>
		<p>- When you register with us through       the Site, as a Member or when you choose to create your own profile       webpage we will ask you for personally identifiable information. This       refers to information about you that when on its own or in combination       with other identifiers can be used to contact or identify you (“<strong>Personal       Information</strong>”).       Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, email       address and postal address. We use your Personal Information mainly to       provide the Service and administer your inquiries. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>- We also collect the other       information that you provide as part of registration and the       administration and personalization of your profile webpage (e.g., without       limitation zip code and individual preferences) (“<strong>Non-Identifying       Information</strong>”).       Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your       Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for       example,&nbsp;combining your zip code with your street address)&nbsp;in a       way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information       are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or       combined only with other non-identifying information (for       example,&nbsp;your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal       Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with       information collected from other Users to attempt to provide you with a       better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to       analyze and understand how our Site and Service are used. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>- We also may use your Personal       Information to contact you with newsletters, marketing or promotional       materials and other information that may be of interest to you. Members       who agree to the terms and conditions of the TVProcessing Terms of Service       Agreement are given the opportunity to opt into receiving such       communications from us in the future. If you decide at any time that you       no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the       unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update       your “user preferences” information. (See “<strong>Changing       or Deleting Information</strong>,” below.) </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><u>Log  Data. </u>When you visit the Site, whether as a Member or a non-registered  user just browsing, our servers automatically record information that your  browser sends whenever you visit a website (“<strong>Log Data</strong>”). This log data may  include information such as your computer’s IP address, browser type or the  domain from which you are visiting. We use this information to monitor and  analyze use of the Site and the Service and for the Site’s technical  administration. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in  association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze  and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding  other Non-Identifying Information.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
		<p> <br>
		  Like many websites, we  use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we  transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use  cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your  registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site. Second, we  utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better  understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by  Users and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session  cookies are deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Third party  advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can  instruct your browser,&nbsp;by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies  or to prompt you before&nbsp;accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If  you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of  the Site or all functionality of the Service. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure </strong> </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><u>Aggregate  Information and Non-Identifying Information.</u> We may share aggregated  information which does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise  disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for  industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any such  aggregated information will not contain your Personal Information. </p>
		<p><u>Service  Providers.</u> We may employ third party companies and individuals to  facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform  Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database  management, web analytics and improvement of the Site’s features), or to assist  us in analyzing how our Site and Service are used. These third parties have  access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf  and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.<br>
            <u>Business  Transfers.</u> TVProcessing may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all  of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a  merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of  bankruptcy. If TVProcessing becomes involved in a merger, acquisition,  reorganization or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will  provide notice to you before your Personal Information is transferred and  becomes subject to a different privacy policy. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong>Changing or Deleting Your Information</strong> </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>All Members may review,  update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration  profile by contacting us. If you completely delete all such information, then  your account may become deactivated. If you would like us to delete your record  in our system, please contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your  request. See below for privacy contact information. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong>Security &amp; International Transfer </strong> </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>TVProcessing is very  concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ administrative,  physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from  unauthorized access. Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on  — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other  governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as  those in your jurisdiction<br>
		  We will make any legally  required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality or  integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored Personal Data (as defined  in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email  or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and  without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs  of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the  breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong> </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Our Site contains links  to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a  banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third-party link,  you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a  website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an  endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third  party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security  policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites.  These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer,  collect data or solicit personal information from you. This Privacy Policy  addresses the use and disclosure of information that we collect from you  through this Site. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or  disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to  read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong>Our Policy Toward Children</strong> </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>This Site is not directed  to children under 18. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her  child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or  she should contact us. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us  with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files. </p>
