#### Watkins Incorporated Privacy Statement

**Watkins commitment to you:**

Since its establishment in 1868, Watkins has been committed to providing high-quality products and superior service. In today's online world, part of that service includes respecting your privacy and protecting the security of your personal information. We value your business and are committed to providing you with a secure, pleasant shopping experience.

**What information do we collect?**

To help us compile statistics regarding the number of online guests who visit our site, Watkins collects and stores only the following information: the date and time our site was accessed, which areas of the site were accessed, the address of any site a visitor linked from, and the name of the domain that was used to access the Internet (i.e. aol.com, etc.) With this information, we are better able to ensure the continued usefulness of our site to you and other consumers.

We also collect the information you provide to us when placing an order, requesting a catalog, opening an account, or enrolling in a Watkins program or service. This information may include your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and payment information, along with any other account information you provide.

**How do we use the information collected?**

We understand the value of excellent service. Part of the value of shopping with Watkins is the opportunity for you to receive personal service and in-depth product information from a Watkins Associate, should you so choose. If you do not have a Watkins Associate when you order, we may forward your name, address, and e-mail address to one of our field Associates so that he/she can offer you his/her service. Because the Associate may offer to send you catalogs periodically, offer special sales, or help you select the products appropriate to your needs, most of our customers find this a value-added service; however, you are free to decline this offer of additional service. Just let your Associate know that you will be ordering direct.

Aside from offering the value-added service of your own Watkins Associate, we will not share your personal information with any business or third party. We will simply use the information you provide to complete the function you have requested. We may also periodically send you announcements about new products and services, discounts, special promotions, or upcoming events.

**What are "cookies" and how do we use them?**

A cookie is a small text file placed on your computer when you visit a web site. This text file gives your computer a unique identification. At Watkins, we use cookies to connect your computer with the information we store for you in our database. This information may include the pages you viewed when previously visiting our site, your account preferences, and items added to your shopping cart. The next time you visit our site, the cookie will "remember" your previous visits. As a result, our pages will load more quickly, and you'll be able to navigate through our site more easily.
