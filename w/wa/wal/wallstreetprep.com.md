## 3\. How We Get Data About You

We use tools like cookies, email marketing services and analytics services to gather the data listed above. Some of these tools offer you the ability to opt out of data collection.

### 3.1 Cookies and Data Collection Tools

As detailed below in our Cookie Policy, Wall Street Prep and service providers acting on our behalf (like Google Analytics and third party applications) use server log files and automated data collection tools like cookies, tags, scripts, customized links, device or browser fingerprints, and web beacons (together,  **“Data Collection Tools”** ) when you access and use the Services. These Data Collection Tools automatically track and collect certain System Data and Usage Data (as detailed in Section 1) when you use the Services. In some cases, we tie data gathered through those Data Collection Tools to other data that we collect as described in this Privacy Policy.

We use cookies (small files that websites send to your device to uniquely identify your browser or device or to store data in your browser) for things like analyzing your use of the Services, personalizing your experience, making it easier to log into the Services, and recognizing you when you return. We or our third-party applications use web beacons (small objects that allow us to measure the actions of visitors and users using the Services) for things like identifying whether a page was visited, identifying whether an email was opened, and advertising more efficiently by excluding current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new mobile app download.

Wall Street Prep uses the following types of cookies:

  *  _Preferences:_  cookies that remember data about your browser and preferred settings that affect the appearance and behavior of the Services (like your preferred language).
  *  _Security:_  cookies used to enable you to log in and access the Services; protect against fraudulent logins; and help detect and prevent abuse or unauthorized use of your account.
  *  _Functional:_  cookies that store functional settings (like the layout you've selected for viewing lessons or current promotions available to you).
  *  _Session State:_  cookies that track your interactions with the Services to help us improve the Services and your browsing experience, remember your login details, and enable processing of your course purchases. These are strictly necessary for the Services to work properly.



You can set your web browser to alert you about attempts to place cookies on your computer, limit the types of cookies you allow, or refuse cookies altogether. If you do, you may not be able to use some or all features of the Services, and your experience may be less functional.

### 3.2 Analytics

We use third-party browser and mobile analytics services like Google Analytics. These services use Data Collection Tools to help us analyze your use of the Services, including information like the third-party website you arrive from, how often you visit, events within the Services and usage and performance data. We use this data to improve the Services, better understand how the Services perform on different devices, and provide information that may be of interest to you.

### 3.3 Online Advertising

We use third-party advertising services like Google’s ad services to deliver advertising about our Services on other websites and applications you use. The ads may be based on things we know about you, like your Usage Data and System Data (as detailed in Section 1), and things that these ad service providers know about you based on their tracking data. The ads can be based on your recent activity or activity over time and across other sites and services, and may be tailored to your interests.

Depending on the types of advertising services we use, they may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your device to collect data about your use of our Services, and may access those tracking technologies in order to serve these tailored advertisements to you. To help deliver tailored advertising, we may provide these service providers with a hashed, anonymized version of your email address (in a non-human-readable form) and content that you share publicly on the Services.

## 4\. What We Use Your Data For

We use your data to do things like provide our Services, communicate with you, troubleshoot issues, secure against fraud and abuse, improve and update our Services, analyze how people use our Services, serve personalized advertising, and as required by law or necessary for safety and integrity.

We use the data we collect through your use of the Services to:

  * Provide and administer the Services, including to display customized content and facilitate communication with other users;
  * Process your requests and orders for courses, products, specific services, information, or features;
  * Communicate with you about your account;
  * Manage your account preferences;
  * Facilitate the Services’ technical functioning, including troubleshooting and resolving issues, securing the Services, and preventing fraud and abuse;
  * Solicit feedback from users;
  * Market and administer reviews and promotions administered or sponsored by Wall Street Prep;
  * Learn more about you by linking your data with additional data through third-party data providers or analyzing the data with the help of analytics service providers;
  * Improve our Services and develop new products, services, and features;
  * Analyze trends and traffic, track purchases, and track usage data;
  * As required or permitted by law; or
  * As we, in our sole discretion, otherwise determine to be necessary to ensure the safety or integrity of our users, employees, third parties, the public, or our Services.



## 

We share certain data about you with training group leaders/instructors, administrators of organizations you are a member of, your employer, analytics and data enrichment providers, companies helping us run promotions or reviews/surveys, and advertising companies who help us promote our Services. We may also share your data as needed for security, legal compliance, or as part of a corporate restructuring. Lastly, we can share data in other ways if it is aggregated or de-identified or if we get your explicit consent.

We may share your data with third parties under the following circumstances or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:

  *  **With Your Employer or Training Group Administrator:**  As many employers and university instructors or organizations use Wall Street Prep for coursework and training, we share your course, quiz and exam data including course completion and exam/quiz scores with employers/training group administrators/instructors who have signed you up for a Wall Street Prep account through a Service Agreement.
  *  **With Service Providers, Contractors, and Agents:**  We share your data with third-party companies who perform services on our behalf, like payment processing, data analysis, marketing services, email and hosting services, and customer services and support. These service providers may access your personal data and are required to use it solely as we direct, to provide our requested service.
  *  **With Analytics and Data Enrichment Services:**  As part of our use of third-party analytics tools like Google Analytics, we share certain contact information, Account Data, System Data, Usage Data (as detailed in Section 1), or de-identified data as needed. De-identified data means data for which we’ve removed things like your name and email address and replaced it with a token ID. This allows these providers to provide analytics services or match your data with publicly-available database information (including contact and social information from other sources). We do this to communicate with you in a more effective and customized manner.
  *  **To Power Social Media Features:  **The social media features in the Services (like the Facebook Like button) may allow the third-party social media provider to collect things like your IP address and which page of the Services you’re visiting, and to set a cookie to enable the feature. Your interactions with these features are governed by the third-party company’s privacy policy.
  *  **To Administer Reviews and Surveys:  **We may share your data as necessary to administer, market, or sponsor promotions and solicit reviews of products you choose to participate in, as required by applicable law (like to provide a winners list or make required filings), or in accordance with the rules of the promotion or survey.
  *  **For Advertising:**  If we decide to offer advertising in the future, we may use and share certain System Data and Usage Data with third-party advertisers and networks to show general demographic and preference information among our users. We may also allow advertisers to collect System Data through Data Collection Tools (as detailed in Section 2.1), and to use this data to offer you targeted ad delivery to personalize your user experience (through behavioral advertising) and undertake web analytics. Advertisers may also share with us the data they collect about you. To learn more or opt out from participating ad networks’ behavioral advertising, see Section 6.1 (Your Choices About the Use of Your Data) below. Note that if you opt out, you’ll continue to be served generic ads.
  *  **For Security and Legal Compliance:  **We may disclose your data to third parties if we (in our sole discretion) have a good faith belief that the disclosure is:
    * Permitted or required by law;
    * Requested as part of a judicial, governmental, or legal inquiry, order, or proceeding;
    * Reasonably necessary as part of a valid subpoena, warrant, or other legally-valid request;
    * Reasonably necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and other legal agreements;
    * Required to detect, prevent, or address fraud, abuse, misuse, potential violations of law (or rule or regulation), or security or technical issues; or
    * Reasonably necessary in our discretion to protect against imminent harm to the rights, property, or safety of Wall Street Prep, our users, employees, members of the public, or our Services.
    * We may also disclose data about you to our auditors and legal advisors in order to assess our disclosure obligations and rights under this Privacy Policy.
  *  **During a Change in Control:  **If Wall Street Prep undergoes a business transaction like a merger, acquisition, corporate divestiture, or dissolution (including bankruptcy), or a sale of all or some of its assets, we may share, disclose, or transfer all of your data to the successor organization during such transition or in contemplation of a transition (including during due diligence).
  *  **After Aggregation/De-identification:**  we can disclose or use aggregate or de-identified data for any purpose.
  *  **With Your Permission:**  with your consent, we may share data to third parties outside the scope of this Privacy Policy.



## 6\. Security

We use appropriate security based on the type and sensitivity of data being stored. As with any internet-enabled system, there is always a risk of unauthorized access, so it’s important to contact us if you suspect any unauthorized access to your account.

Wall Street Prep takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal data that we collect and store. These measures vary based on the type and sensitivity of the data. Unfortunately, however, no system can be 100% secured, so we cannot guarantee that communications between you and Wall Street Prep, the Services, or any information provided to us in connection with the data we collect through the Services will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. Your password is an important part of our security system, and it is your responsibility to protect it. If you believe account has been compromised, you should  contact [dpo@wallstreetprep.com](mailto:dpo@wallstreetprep.com) with any concerns.

###  What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files stored by your browser as you browse the internet. They can be used to collect, store, and share data about your activities across websites, including on Wall Street Prep. Cookies also allow us to remember things about your visits to Wall Street Prep, like your preferred language, and to make the site easier to use.

We use both session cookies, which expire after a short time or when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which remain stored in your browser for a set period of time. We use session cookies to identify you during a single browsing session, like when you log into Wall Street Prep. We use persistent cookies where we need to identify you over a longer period, like when you request that we keep you signed in.

### Why does Wall Street Prep use cookies and similar technologies?

We use cookies and similar technologies like web beacons, pixel tags, or local shared objects (“flash cookies”), to deliver, measure, and improve our services in various ways. We use these cookies both when you visit our site and services through a browser and through our mobile app. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional data through other methods.

We use cookies for the following purposes:

  * To log you into Wall Street Prep
  * To protect your security
  * To help detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate Wall Street Prep’s agreements

 **Preferences**| 

  * To remember data about your browser and your preferences
  * To remember your settings and other choices you’ve made

  
---|---  
  
For example, cookies help us remember your preferred language or the country you’re in, so we can provide content in your preferred language without asking each time you visit.

 **Analytics and research**| 

  * To help us improve and understand how people use Wall Street Prep

  
---|---  
  
For example, cookies help us test different versions of Wall Street Prep to see which features or content users prefer, web beacons help us determine which email messages are opened, and cookies help us see how you interact with Wall Street Prep, like the links you click on.

We also work with a number of analytics partners, including Google Analytics, who use cookies and similar technologies to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the sites from which you arrive. Those service providers may either collect that data themselves or we may disclose it to them.

You can opt out of some of these services through tools like the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)

 **Personalized content**| 

  * To customize Wall Street Prep with more relevant content

  
---|---  
  
For example, cookies help us show a personalized list of recommended courses on the homepage.

 **Advertising**| 

  * To provide you with more relevant advertising
