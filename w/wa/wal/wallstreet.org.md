# Privacy Policy - Wallstreet.org

From time to time, WallStreet.org may either collect information from readers, or readers may post information on WallStreet.org. The website shall deem that it has been given the rights to use this shared information in perpetuity.

The entire content of all emails sent to us on email addresses other than contact@WallStreet.org shall be considered as “on the record” information, and the website shall use any or all such information as per its discretion.

All information, such as name, company, email address, physical address, or contact numbers of visitors or readers submitting content at contact@WallStreet.org shall be considered as “off the record” for publication uses and will not be referred to or used in any way, unless otherwise explicitly directed by the visitor or reader that such information is to be considered “on the record.”

For the uses pertaining to publication, all information other than that mentioned above shall be considered as “on the record” by the website, unless otherwise explicitly directed by the user/tipster that such information be “off the record.”

For reasons of compliance with laws and regulations of some countries, information submitted at contact@WallStreet.org may be subject to be disclosed to relevant authorities. Users/tipsters intending to avoid this should use some private, offshore email provider.

The logs maintained by the website are for analytical purposes, which help the website in improving user experience and other benefits. There may be instances where the website may be compelled to disclose information in these logs to law enforcement officials, in which case the website would reasonably comply with such demands.

If the user/tipster does not want their name or such information published, they should submit a written request at contact@WallStreet.org

WallStreet.org may require email IDs or other personal information of its users/tipsters for some of its services, such as newsletters, and for filtering out issues such as repeat registrations.

Some of the services provided on the website and the advertisers of this website make use of cookies. Usage of such cookies may not be in the notice of the website; hence, users/tipsters can disable/turn them off in their browsers.

This website has links to other websites as well, where the privacy policies could vary by either being less or more comprehensive. In such instances, WallStreet.org bears no responsibility, as those are not its domain.

At any point in time, the website retains the right to alter the privacy policy and other terms of use without prior notice.
