# About – Walker News

About WalkerNews.net

Every incident has a time and a venue. When there are something worth to write down for memory and reference, I try to record each of them in [WalkerNews.net](http://www.walkernews.net/ "Home - WalkerNews.net").

> WalkerNews is a capsule of Walker’s experience in life since 2007 Feb. 

Other than storing my experience on the Net, WalkerNews.net is also a place for me to practice documentation and writing skills. Although, it’s a shame to say that my skills are still suck :-(. That’s why those copycats who duplicate my writing to their splogs look suck too :-P.

> It is fine to write on a same topic, but make it appears with own presentation and expression style for the sake of reading pleasure and creative improvement. 

You are [welcomed](http://www.walkernews.net/contact/ "Contact WalkerNews.net") to participate in the space of WalkerNews.net, to make it a “place” for every walkers around the globe to share his/her own incidents or experiences.
