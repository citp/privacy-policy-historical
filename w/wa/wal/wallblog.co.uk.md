## Collection of your personal data

### Personal data you provide directly to us

We collect personal data from you when you enquire about or request a product or service directly from us. For example you will provide personal data to us when you;

  * subscribe to a magazine
  * apply for a job
  * sign up for a digital product or service
  * register to attend a conference, an award or forum event
  * request a newsletter/bulletin
  * enter a competition or prize draw



The information we routinely collect will include your contact details (e.g. name, email address, phone number and postal address). We will also collect specific information where relevant for a particular service. For example, you would provide your car registration number if requesting a vehicle valuation or you may choose to upload your CV when using one of our job sites.

When you register to attend one of our events, we may also collect details about your dietary and accessibility requirements. We only collect this information with your explicit consent and will only use it for the purposes of your attendance at the event.

To learn more please see How we use your personal data.

### When you visit our websites

When you visit one of our websites for the first time, you will receive a "pop-up" notice informing you that we use Cookies. Some personal data (for example a unique identifier, your IP address and geographical location) will be collected through our and our technology partners' use of cookies and similar technologies. To learn more please see our Cookie Notice.

### From other organisations or publicly available sources

We sometimes combine information we have collected from our websites or other sources, with information received from other organisations. This is used to:

  * verify the personal data we hold for you (e.g. to check your postal address is correct)
  * enhance the content and relevance of the advertising we provide to you. To learn more please see Personalise website content and our Cookie Notice.



We may also research publicly available sources (e.g. websites and LinkedIn) and use external suppliers, to identify business contacts who are likely to be interested in the products and services we have to offer. We will only collect the minimal amount of information required for this purpose (e.g. name, job title, company and contact details) and when we contact you we will always provide you with an easy way to object to us continuing to retain your personal data.

## The lawful bases we rely on

Under the GDPR there are six lawful bases under which organisations can collect, use and store personal data. We have identified four which we rely upon for our business activities: Consent, Contractual, Legitimate Interests and Legal Obligation.

Contractual - in many circumstances we rely on the lawful basis of "performance of a contract", this enables us to respond to you when you express an interest in our products and services and to fulfil any requests. To learn more please see Fulfilment of a service.

Consent - in some circumstances we rely on your specific consent, whereby you actively agree and "opt-in". We will always make it clear how you can withdraw you consent at any time. To learn more please see How to stop marketing communications.

Legal Obligation - there will be circumstances under which we are legally obliged to hold your personal data or required to disclose it to a third party by law.

Legitimate Interests - for some of our activities we rely on our legitimate business interests to collect and use your personal data. In such cases, we have balanced our interests with yours and do not believe these activities will have a negative impact on your privacy rights and freedoms. We specifically rely on Legitimate Interests to:

  * manage specific aspects of our events. To learn more please see Conference events, Award events and Forum events
  * send you marketing communications about our products and services. To learn more please see Marketing communications
  * send you marketing communications related to other companies' products and services (in a business-to-business context). To learn more please see Marketing communications

Please [email us](mailto:live.eventsteam@haymarket.com?subject=Awards%20Event%20Privacy%20Query) if you would prefer your name not to appear.

We will also share the attendee list with the venue for fire regulation purposes.

#### Forum events

Please find below information about how your personal data may be used when you register to attend one of our Business Forums.

These events are specifically designed to invite delegates to meet and network with specific service suppliers. We believe it is in everyone's interests for business contact details to be shared between delegates and suppliers. You will always be informed of this. We will also need to share basic details to facilitate your travel and accommodation.

Please note that photographs and video footage may be taken at this event for use in post-event publicity.

If you have any queries or concerns please [email us](mailto:live.eventsteam@haymarket.com).

#### Sponsored content

Our Haymarket Business Media brands often provide sponsored content, such as webinars, expert reports, whitepapers, surveys or events.

We will share the details you provide to access this specific content with the named sponsor. However, this is always your choice and you will be provided with a clear opportunity to indicate if you would prefer us not to share this information.

#### Job seeking service

Please find below information about how we use your personal data when you use our job seeking services. These services allow you to receive job alerts, upload your CV and share your details with recruiters.

If you apply for a job, your details will be shared with the recruiter promoting the specific role. At your request we will share your data with Top CV and/or allow recruiters to access your CV.

### Marketing communications

When we collect your personal data we will include a specific notice to inform you and give you choices about future direct marketing communications from us.

We will only send you direct marketing communications when you have either:

  * provided your consent (e.g. ticked a box or clicked a "button" to submit a form)
  * where we believe we can demonstrate a legitimate business interest and have balanced this with your interests and privacy.



It is always your choice and you can stop receiving direct marketing communications from us at any time. We will provide a clear and easy way to do this on any communication you receive. To learn more please see How to stop marketing communications.

For electronic marketing communications (via email, sms and phone) we adhere to the rules of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR).

### Personalise marketing content

We want to ensure our marketing communications are of interest to you. We therefore use the information we know about you to tailor our messages to be more relevant. We will use details such as your gender, age, geographical location, previous transactional history, and site usage to try and do this. You have the right to object, but this will mean we will be unable to send your marketing communications in future, as we do not wish to send irrelevant messages to you. To learn more please see How to stop marketing communications.

### Personalise website content

We believe website content is more interesting to you when it is relevant. We provide tailored recommendations and advertisements to customise the content that you see on our websites. To do this, we use cookies and similar technologies through various technology partners to help us understand how you interact with our websites (e.g. the content you viewed on a previous visit or aggregated website performance analytics). To learn more please see our Cookie Notice.

## How to stop receiving marketing communications

We don't want to send you marketing communications if you do not want to receive them. You can stop receiving these messages from us at anytime.

We have a diverse range of brands in our Haymarket Automotive, Haymarket Consumer Media and Haymarket Business Media divisions, which you may not realise are all published by Haymarket Media Group. You may therefore wish to be selective and just stop receiving marketing communications from one brand rather than from them all.

**Emails** : There will always be an unsubscribe link on any marketing email you receive from us. Some of our brands (where relevant) provide a level of granularity to the types of emails you can unsubscribe from.  
**Post** : We will inform you in any postal communication how you can stop receiving direct mail in future.  
**Phone** : If you receive a marketing call from us, please let the call operator know if you don't want to receive calls again.  
**SMS** : Please text "STOP" to any message received.

## Protecting children

All of our brands are aimed at adults and are not designed for use by children. However, we accept that on occasion children may visit our websites. Where we believe any of our brands may attract children under the age of 16, we will clearly provide information notices to try and deter children from providing their personal data.

We clearly stipulate that entry into any of our competitions is only available to over 18s. In exceptional circumstances we may lower this, but never lower than 16 and this will always be clearly stipulated in the terms and conditions for the specific competition.

We do not knowingly intend to send marketing communications to children.

We actively encourage all our staff, whenever they are implementing new promotions, offers or events to assess whether these might be attractive to children and if so, will ensure clear information is provided to try and deter children from providing their personal data.

If you are a parent or guardian and are concerned that we may be processing personal data related to your child, please use Our contact details.

## Your rights

Under data protection law you have a number of rights. These are aimed at giving you control about how your personal data is used by us.

To object to direct marketing, please see: How to stop marketing communications

To exercise any of your rights please use Our contact details.

If you are unhappy with the manner in which we have collected and are using your personal data please do not hesitate to contact us.

If you are concerned with the manner in which we have handled your personal data, you have the right to complain to a supervisory authority. In the UK this is the [Information Commissioner's Office](https://ico.org.uk/).

### Access your personal data

You can request a copy of the personal data we may hold relating to you, and the purposes for which we are using it. This is known as a Subject Access Request. In responding to such a request we may ask for proof of your identity, to ensure we do not inadvertently send your personal data to another person. We will endeavour to respond to any such requests as soon as possible, but at least within one calendar month. Please use Our contact details.

### Amend your personal data

If you discover or believe the personal data we hold for you is out of date or incorrect please let us know and we will rectify this as soon as possible. Please use Our contact details.

## Keeping your data secure

### Where we store your personal data

Ensuring your personal data is kept and transferred securely is of the highest importance to us.

We hold your personal data on our secure systems, mainly based within the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA). Please also see How we keep your personal data secure. Where we employ service providers, we have appropriate agreements in place to ensure your personal data is protected.

Your personal data may be transferred to a country outside the European Economic Area (EEA). This may be required for the purposes of our staff based outside the EEA or where a supplier of a service is based outside the EEA. We will take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure your personal data is treated securely. This includes the use of Binding Corporate Rules and Model Contractual Arrangements as approved by the European Commission, and the EU-US Privacy Shield.

### How we keep your personal data secure

We are committed to protecting the security of the personal data we hold. We deploy appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure your personal data is kept securely and to prevent any unauthorised access. We have robust procedures and features in place to prevent such unauthorised access.

We also require any parties to whom we transfer personal data to ensure they have appropriate security measures in place. Please also see Fulfilment of a service.

### How long do we keep your personal data

We hold personal data for a variety of different purposes and the length of time we keep your information for will vary depending on the products and services we are providing to you. We will only keep your personal data for a reasonable period of time and we base this on the purpose for which we are using it.

There will be circumstances in which we keep a strictly minimal amount of information about you, for example to ensure we can honour an objection to receiving direct marketing. We will also, in specific circumstances, be required to retain personal data for a longer period of time for contractual or legal reasons.

We have a detailed internal schedule for ensuring we do not hold your personal data for longer than we justifiably need it. To learn more please use Our contact details.

### Reporting security vulnerabilities

We are committed to the privacy, safety and security of our customers. If you discover a potential security vulnerability, we would ask you to please report it just to us in a responsible manner. Please email us at [data.protection@haymarket.com](mailto:data.protection@haymarket.com) and we will respond to you as soon as possible. This provides us with an opportunity to work with you and quickly address and resolve any issue. Publicly disclosing a potential vulnerability could put the wider community at risk, and therefore we encourage you to come to us first. We'll keep you informed as we move forward with our investigations.

## Cookie Notice

The aim of our Cookie Notice is to provide you with a summary of the tracking technologies we use and how you can control what is set and when. We keep our Cookie Notice under regular review to best reflect the technology we use on our sites.

### Cookies and tracking technologies we use

Where Haymarket Media Group Ltd or its group companies talk about cookies and tracking technology on our websites (please see Our brands) we refer to the following:

#### Flash Cookies

A local shared object, sometimes called a "Flash cookie," is a data file that can be created on your computer by the websites you visit. They are most often used to enhance your web-browsing experience. Adobe's website provides details regarding [Flash Cookies](https://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/privacy.html)

#### Web Beacons

To help us better manage content we employ web beacons in emails that we send to our subscribers. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier and are used to track the online movements of internet users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on websites. We use them in our HTML-based emails to learn which emails have been opened by recipients enabling us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

#### Pixels

A pixel refers to the code that is placed on your computer in order to trigger a cookie. We sometimes use this methodology to allow us to deliver more relevant messages to you.

#### Log Files

We use log files to record events that occur on our websites. This may include, though not exclusively, the type, content or time of transaction made via your device. These audit trails allow us to analyse activities on our websites.

### How and why we use cookies and tracking technologies

#### Types of Cookies and how they are set

There are two types of cookies:

  1. "Session Cookies" - Stored temporarily in your computer's memory while you are visiting a website and are deleted when you close your browser.

These cookies are essential, as they enable you to move around a website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas. Without these cookies, services you've asked for (such as access to secure areas) can't be provided. These cookies don't gather information about you that can be used for marketing or remembering where you've been on the internet.

**Category 2: Performance cookies**  
These cookies collect information about how you use a website, for example which pages you go to most often and if you get any error messages from certain pages. These cookies don't gather information that identifies you. All information these cookies collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how our website works. These cookies are not used to target you with online advertising. Without these cookies we can't learn how our website is performing and make relevant improvements that could better your browsing experience.

**Category 3: Functionality cookies**  
These cookies allow a website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you're in) and tailor the website to provide enhanced features and content for you. For instance, they can be used to remember log-in details, changes you've made to text size, font and other parts of pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you've asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. These cookies may be used to ensure that all our services and communications are relevant to you. The information these cookies collect cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. Without these cookies, a website cannot remember choices you've previously made or personalise your browsing experience.

**Category 4: Targeting and advertising cookies**  
We use these to provide adverts on our sites that we believe are more relevant to you. Without these cookies, online adverts you encounter will be less relevant to you and your interests. We also enable some advertising partners to set cookies specifically to enable them to analyse advertising campaign performance.
