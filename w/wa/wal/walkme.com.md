**A.     CONSENT AND PRINCIPALS OF PROCESSING DATA**

WalkMe processes data fairly, lawfully, in a transparent manner and in accordance with individuals’ rights (as applicable). The use of information collected through our Services shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which our Client has engaged WalkMe or, if collected through the website or other marketing means, to WalkMe’s legitimate interests, where we have considered these are not overridden by your rights.

WalkMe may process data of an End User on behalf of the Controller when the Controller obtains consent from an End User or when there is another basis for doing so under applicable law. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, a Controller may mean a Customer or anyone acting a Customer’s behalf or, Walkme (only in connection with information provided to it through the website or for marketing purposes). (the “ **Controller** ”), Customers who cause WalkMe to process Personal Information of an End User are obligated to hold all appropriate consents (if applicable) and may only utilize the Services pursuant to applicable law. If you are an End User of the Services, please contact the Controller for additional detail. We may transfer Personal Information to companies that help us provide our Services. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Customers (the Controller). Furthermore, WalkMe supports End Users’ rights to retrieve any information retained on our servers which relates to such End User. WalkMe acknowledges that you have the right to access your Personal Information. We have processes in place to accommodate an End User’s rights to delete data, amend erroneous data, access data and receive Personal Data or Sensitive Data in a machine readable commonly used format, all subject to reasonable technical restrains and abilities. For more information, please see the Section “Modification or Deletion of Data” under the applicable Site or Service Section.

Personal Information or Personal Data is information by which an individual may be personally identified, including name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or any other information that is defined as Personal Information, Personal Data, or Personally Identifiable Information under an applicable law (hereinafter referred to as “ **Personal Information** ”)

Users are not obligated to provide us with any information by law. However, we require certain information in order to operate properly. Under some jurisdictions (such as under certain E.U. regulations), a User has a right to withdraw its consent at any time. In such a case, the withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

Please note that consent for the gathering and processing of data for one Service does not automatically mean that a User consents to the processing of data in connection with other Services. Controller should always make sure that the User’s consent is relevant, clear, valid, and to the extent reasonably possible, not “bundled” with any other written agreement (especially if required under applicable laws), unambiguous and if required under applicable law, affirmative and active (meaning not by virtue of any inaction).

WalkMe aims to process only adequate, accurate and relevant data limited to the needs and purposes for which it is gathered. It also aims to store data for the time period necessary to fulfill the purpose for which the data is gathered. WalkMe only collects data in connection with a specific legitimate purpose and only processes data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

When Personal Information or Personal Data is transferred over the Internet, we encrypt it using Transfer Layer Security (TLS) encryption technology or similar technology. Each server is protected by a firewall, exposing it only to the minimum ports necessary.
