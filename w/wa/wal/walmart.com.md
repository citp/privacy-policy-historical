How We Protect the Security of Your Personal Information

The security of your personal information is very important to us. In our efforts to protect your online transactions, we use a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL (and most are), your personal information will be automatically encrypted, or encoded, before it is sent over the Internet 

Walmart.com has also obtained a digital certificate from Verisign, Inc., a leading provider of Internet trust services. When you enter a secure portion of this Site (which is any page containing any of your personal information), an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser window. If you click on this image, a small popup window displaying site-security information will appear. This certificate guarantees that your personal information is being transmitted in secure (encrypted) form to a Walmart.com web server, not to some unknown or unauthorized server. 

Ultimately, your personal information is protected by the password you created when you created an account at Walmart.com (or another password you chose after changing a previous password). Please keep this password confidential. No Customer Service Associate or any other representative of Walmart.com will ever ask you for your password. The confidentiality of your password is yours to protect. You may change it anytime by going to [Your Account](https://web.archive.org/cservice/ya_index.gsp). Log in with your email address and password, then click "Change Name, Email & Password" and enter a new password.
