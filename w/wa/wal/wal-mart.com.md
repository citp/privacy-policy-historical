We never sell or rent your personal information to any third parties under any circumstances.

How We Protect the Security of Your Personal Information  
  
The security of your personal information is very important to us. In our efforts to protect your online transactions, we use a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL (and most are), your personal information will be automatically encrypted, or encoded, before it is sent over the Internet.

Walmart.com has also obtained a digital certificate from Verisign, Inc., a leading provider of Internet trust services. When you enter a secure portion of this Site (which is any page containing any of your personal information), an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser window. If you click on this image, a small popup window displaying site-security information will appear. This certificate guarantees that your personal information is being transmitted in secure (encrypted) form to a Walmart.com web server, not to some unknown or unauthorized server.

Ultimately, your personal information is protected by the password you created when you created an account at Walmart.com (or another password you chose after changing a previous password). Please keep this password confidential. No Customer Service Associate or any other representative of Walmart.com will ever ask you for your password. The confidentiality of your password is yours to protect. You may change it anytime by going to [Your Account](https://web.archive.org/cservice/ya_index.gsp). Log in with your email address and password, then click "Change Name, Email & Password" and enter a new password.

Cookies and Other Computer Information  
  
When you visit Walmart.com, you will be assigned a permanent "cookie" (a small text file) to be stored on your computer's hard drive. The purpose of this cookie is to identify you when you visit the Site so that we can enhance and customize your online shopping experience. 

You can choose to browse on Walmart.com without cookies. However, without these identifier files you will not be able to complete a purchase or take advantage of certain features of the Site. These features include storing your shopping cart for later use and, in the future, providing a more personalized shopping experience. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

We also collect certain technical information from your computer each time you request a page during a visit to Walmart.com. This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's operating system, browser type and the address of a referring Web site, if any. We collect this information to enhance the quality of your experience during your visit to the Site and will not sell or rent this information to any third parties.

We also contract with third parties to provide us with: data collection and reporting services regarding our customers' activities on the Site; tracking and measuring performance of our marketing efforts and your response to our marketing efforts; and the delivery of relevant marketing messages. These third parties may use cookies and Web beacons (1x1 pixels), and may receive anonymous information about your browsing and buying activity on the Site. None of your personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, email address, credit card number, etc.) will be received by or shared with these third parties. If you do not want your non-personal information used to serve ads to you, you can change the settings of your browser to reject cookies. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

How You Decide What Marketing Communications You Receive  
  
Walmart.com may from time to time send you email messages or other forms of marketing communications describing new items, featured merchandise and great values. You can choose to stop receiving any marketing emails from us at any time. Simply go to [Your Account](https://web.archive.org/cservice/ya_index.gsp), sign in, click "Newsletter Email Preferences" and remove the check in the box next to the online email newsletter(s) you would no longer like to receive. Please allow up to 10 days for us to process your request. If you would prefer to stop receiving other forms of marketing communications from us, please follow the directions on the marketing materials from us or contact our Customer Service department.

The only email messages you will receive from Walmart.com when you elect not to receive marketing emails will be to confirm any purchases you make on our site, let you know your order has been shipped, respond to your Customer Service inquiries and to answer any other questions you may have about our site. In addition, we may also need to send operational emails to inform you of any changes to our site that might affect your personal information, or to announce product recalls. Finally, you will receive service and reminder emails if you register to use certain Walmart.com services, such as the Photo Center, Pharmacy, Vision Center, Music Downloads, and Gift Registry, or if you elect to participate in our Market Research testing.

How We Protect the Privacy of Children   
  
To protect children's personal information and to meet the standards of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we do not collect any personal information from children under 13 that can be used to specifically identify them. Except for the Wal-Mart Toyland Site (further described below), Walmart.com is a general audience web site not geared towards children. Children under the age of 13 may browse this Site, but they may not create a Walmart.com account, make a purchase, sign up for email newsletters or participate in contests or surveys.

In several areas of Walmart.com, such as when customers contact us via email, create a Walmart.com account or sign up for e-mail newsletters and alerts, we ask for birth year information. This information helps us ensure that children do not provide us with their personal detailed information.

We do **not** save birth year information, or use it for any marketing, promotional, or any other purpose.

We appreciate your cooperation in helping enforce children's online privacy. Still have questions? We invite you to review our [Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/catalog/catalog.gsp?cat=121240), or get more information on COPPA from the [Federal Trade Commission](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html).

This Privacy Policy also applies to all activities conducted and personal information collected on the BabyConnection.com web site. We contract with BabyCenter, L.L.C., a Walmart.com service partner, to provide us with web site development, hosting, and content license services in connection with the BabyConnection.com web site, and therefore, BabyCenter may obtain limited customer information collected on the BabyConnection.com web site.

The Walmart Toyland Site  
  
The Wal-Mart Toyland Site is linked to Walmart.com and is designed to be a fun way for children to build wishlists for their parents and other adult relatives. This Privacy Policy also applies to all activities conducted and information, if any, collected on the Wal-Mart Toyland Site. The site will not collect any personal information from children that can be used to specifically identify them. The only information that may be collected about the child is a first name, as an optional feature to improve the interactivity of the Wal-Mart Toyland Site. The site will also collect the name and email address of a parent and/or adult relative the child chooses to send his/her wishlist to. This information will only be used to send the child's wishlist and will not be saved or used for any other purpose. Although the Wal-Mart Toyland Site does not save the recipient's email address, it does save the wishlist. If a parent so chooses they can delete their child's wishlist by (a) deleting any bookmark or link to the wishlist their child may have created; or (b) clicking the "Start Over" button anywhere within the wishlist function.
