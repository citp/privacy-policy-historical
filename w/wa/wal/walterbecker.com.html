            is run by individuals who are fiercely
            devoted to the privacy of our visitors

            <p class="bodylink">All privacy policies described here are subject to change,&nbsp;most <br>
              likely to comply with what we view as the end user's reasonable&nbsp;<br>
              expectations of privacy, &nbsp;or to comply with any new laws -- such as the new <br>
              GDPR of 2018, sweeping and strict privacy legislation&nbsp;designed to protect all EU users. Any such changes that&nbsp;require action on your part will of course be detailed here. For example, an argument could be made that we -- all mailers--should ask subscribers to "resubscribe". But since our original double opt-in method already complied with the stricter standard, and the content or purpose of the Newsletter hasn't changed, nor has our Privacy Policy (except to add more detail), we argue that - hey, why bother people to say they want something they've said they want by saying that they want it -- twice? So for now, at least, no recommitment ceremony is planned. [a good general overview on the workings of a double opt-in is on <a href="http://sdarchive.com/newsletterfaq.html" class="container" target="new">this FAQ</a>. It is from another website, but its description of the double opt-in procedure is applicable here, especially the sections <em>Joining, Leaving, Changing Subscriptions</em>,

and <em>Delivery and Subscription Problems</em>]</p>

              list or other information on this site
              for the purpose of sending unsolicited
              email should be advised that we do record
              and track such attempts. Safeguards are
              in place that will cause any such attempt
              to fail. The newsletter subscription
              of any list member identified as party
              to such an attempt will be immediately
              and silently terminated, at minimum;
              we may also take additional measures
              by which we will register and express
              our zero tolerance for such behavior.</p>
