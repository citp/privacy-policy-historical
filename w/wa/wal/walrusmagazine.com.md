These are mostly other magazines, book clubs, registered charities, and non-profit organizations. The Walrus itself was launched using such lists. If you prefer to have your contact information removed from the list so that you won’t receive such mailings, send an email to [_subs@thewalrus.ca_](mailto:subs@thewalrus.ca) or write to us at:
