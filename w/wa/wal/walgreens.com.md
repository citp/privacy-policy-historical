# Walgreens | Help | Online Privacy and Security Statement

  
**Online Privacy and Security Statement**

**Your Information**  
For nearly 100 years, Walgreens has established itself as one of the most trusted healthcare providers in America. Our company has always been committed to providing our valued customers with the best services available. Now, as we offer our convenient online pharmacy service, we want you to be assured that your personal information is properly safeguarded. In the following sections, you will learn how Walgreens secures your private information. 

When you order prescription drugs, our registration process asks you to provide us with a limited amount of personal and health-related information. This information is necessary to process your prescription order. We understand that you may not wish to share medical information with others and for that reason, we have provided you with the means to control access to your information. 

Once you have both registered and completed a prescription order, we will mail a personal identification number [(PIN)](http://www.walgreens.com/help/pin.jhtml) to you. You should keep your [PIN](http://www.walgreens.com/help/pin.jhtml) and your password confidential. 

When you enter your [PIN](http://www.walgreens.com/help/pin.jhtml) you will be able to access your own prescription history* at Walgreens. If you provide us with information about your drug allergies and/or existing medical conditions, our pharmacists will use third party drug information providers to evaluate that information against any prescription you order. It is your responsibility to review your account and keep it up to date. 

*Prescription information will be available for up to 15 months from the date the prescription was filled. 

**How We Use Your Information**  
You may choose to supply personalized information that will enable you to receive individualized customer service that we cannot offer anonymous users. That customer service may include notices about updates to our web site, e-mail reminders, messaging with Walgreens pharmacists, and medical content from Mayo Clinic Health Information. We are the ONLY online pharmacy that Mayo Clinic Health Information has chosen to provide with its trusted medical information. 

We will not intentionally release your particular prescription information other than to you, our contracted fulfillment parties (if any), your authorized representative, or your prescriber or other authorized medical professional. We may forward your prescription information to your insurance plan, so that we can handle reimbursement of your prescription purchase for your convenience. 

We may share non-medical information and summary or aggregate statistical information and data with our content providers, suppliers, vendors and other third parties. You may elect to decline these additional e-mails by clicking [See & Edit Your Account](https://www.walgreens.com/pharmacy/register/viewpersonalinfo.jhtml). Your medical information will not be intentionally provided to third parties unless: we have received your permission; we believe in good faith that we are legally obligated to do so; or such release is necessary to protect our rights or property. In compliance with the Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996, Walgreens.com will provide the Drug Enforcement Administration with the name and address of each individual who purchases products on Walgreens.com which contain the ingredients ephedrine or pseudophedrine. We will disclose medical and other information which may relate to you as and if required by law. 

**Receiving E-mail from Walgreens**  
We will contact you by e-mail throughout the ordering process. Certain prescription-related issues may require your response to complete your order successfully. Please be sure to check your e-mail regularly once you have placed your order online. If we are unable to reach you by e-mail, we may try to contact you by phone. 

In addition, we may occasionally send useful information to you by e-mail, including new products and services offered by us or other organizations. Although it still may be necessary for our pharmacists to contact you regarding your prescription, you may decline to receive any additional e-mail concerning new products and services by clicking [See & Edit Your Account](https://www.walgreens.com/pharmacy/register/viewpersonalinfo.jhtml) in the pharmacy department. Click **Edit Personal Information** , and select **No** in answer to the question about receiving e-mail. Then click **Update**. 

**Security (Secure Socket Layer)**  
Walgreens is committed to securing your personal information. We use technology that is designed for use with secure Web servers. Prescription drug information resides in a database behind a firewall where it cannot be accessed without proper authorization. Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") technology encrypts your personal information as well as your prescription health history as it is transmitted over the Internet. You maintain the security of your medical information by keeping your user name, password, [PIN](http://www.walgreens.com/help/pin.jhtml) and other personal-identifying information confidential. In addition, Walgreens customer service representatives will never ask you or call you to request your password. 

**Cookies**  
Along with many other Web sites, we may use a feature on your Internet browser commonly called a "cookie" in order to provide you with better service. "Cookies" are small files that your browser places on your computer's hard drive. They enable us to know whether you are a returning customer and if you found **Walgreens.com** via another site or advertisement. The cookies help us personalize your shopping experience and save you from re-entering information each time you visit us. Cookies do not enable us to determine the identity of any visitor to our web site. We cannot identify you unless you specifically tell us who you are. Most Internet browsers permit you to erase or block cookies. Refer to your browser instructions or help screens to assist you in this process. 

**Your Consent**  
By visiting our web site and using the services and features that we have made available, you consent to our collection and use of information in the manner we have described for you in the **How We Use Your Information** paragraph of this help section. You also consent to the terms and conditions that we have posted on our web site. 

**Links to Other Sites**  
We may provide links to other sites that we believe offer our customers useful services. Since these other sites are not under the control of Walgreens, we cannot and do not make any representation or guarantee regarding the linked sites or their content. Our providing these links does not constitute an endorsement by Walgreens, and we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies or security procedures of the linked sites. Therefore, you may want to review a linked site's privacy and security policies before entering any information. 

**Credit Card Fraud**  
Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, you cannot be held liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your credit card provider requires payment of any of this $50.00 amount as a result of a purchase made at our web site's secure server, we will reimburse you up to that $50.00 limit. 

**Verified by Visa**  
Walgreens.com also supports the Verified by Visa Security Service.
