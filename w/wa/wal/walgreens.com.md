**What information does Walgreens.com collect?**  
When you order products and prescription drugs, our registration process asks you to provide us with a limited amount of personal and/or health-related information. This information is necessary to process your order. Some examples are: name, e-mail address, and billing/shipping information (credit card number, shipping address) Additionally, our web server automatically collects click-stream information such as the address (or "URL") of the web site that you came from before visiting our site, which pages you visit on our site, which browser you used to view our site and any search terms you have entered on our site. 

**How is the information used?**  
You may choose to supply personalized information that will enable you to receive individualized customer service that we cannot offer anonymous users. That customer service may include notices about updates to our web site, e-mail reminders, messaging with Walgreens pharmacists, and medical content from Mayo Clinic Health Information. We also use the information that you provide in order to respond to your requests, customize your online shopping experience, administer contests or promotions, offer new products and services, and measure and improve the effectiveness of our web sites or our marketing endeavors. 

**Does Walgreens.com share the information I've provided?**  
We will not intentionally release your particular prescription information other than to you, Walgreen Co. and its subsidiaries, our **agents** (such as contracted fulfillment parties, if any) your authorized representative, or your prescriber or other authorized medical professional. We may forward your prescription information to your insurance plan, so that we can handle reimbursement of your prescription purchase for your convenience. 

**Agents:** We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. These functions may include fulfilling orders for the Health Info Card program, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, or processing credit card payments. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 

**Promotional Offers:** We may send offers to selected groups of Walgreens.com customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please notify us. 

**Disclosures:** As required by law we will disclose medical and other information which may relate to you. For example, in compliance with the Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996, Walgreens.com will provide the Drug Enforcement Administration with the name and address of each individual who purchases products on Walgreens.com which contain the ingredients ephedrine or pseudophedrine. 

**Business Transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that Walgreens.com, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets and is permissible under law. 

**Protection of Walgreens.com and Others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with laws; enforce or apply our [Terms of Use](http://www.walgreens.com/common/termsofuse.jhtml) and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Walgreens.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 

**Third Party Service Providers:** Our web site uses a third party service provider to serve images. This service allows us to improve your overall customer experience. They also use similar technology to improve the overall user experience.

  * You can add or update certain information on pages such as those listed in the "What information can I access?" section above.
