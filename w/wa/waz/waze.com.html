process. If you do so:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Waze will still link all of your information with your Account and a unique identifier generated by Waze in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
This helps us do things like find you the best route.</li>

  <li>When using the Application, your approximate location and other information you may choose to contribute will be visible to other users associated
with the general username “Wazer”.</li>
  <li>Note that in order to access certain features of the Services (for example map editing, ranking, moods) you will need to set up a unique username to
identify yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do set up a Waze username and password in the Application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Waze will link all of your information with your Account and that username. This includes information received from all mobile devices running the
Application on which you have chosen to sign in using your username and password;</li>

with that username.</li>
  <li>Waze may also establish and require from time to time additional or different means of identification and authentication for logging in and
accessing the Services or for accessing certain features or designated sections of the Services.</li>
  <li>Your login details are your responsibility. You are fully accountable for any use or misuse of your Account and personal details as a result of
conveying your login details to someone else. You must maintain your login details in absolute confidentiality and avoid disclosing them to others.
Make sure that you change your password frequently and at least once every six months.</li>

like monitoring traffic so you know when to leave, and showing you relevant ads while using Waze. The information Waze collects, and how that
information is used, depends on how you choose to use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.</p>

</ul>

<p>We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h1 id="sharing-your-information">Sharing your information</h1>

<h3 id="personal-information-that-you-share">Personal information that you share</h3>

<p>The Services are based on a community of users publicly sharing information with Waze and with other members of that community.</p>

<p>In particular, users may choose to share personal information such as name, age, gender, picture, their location information, reports and other files.
This information may be shared either directly to the Services and to all users, such as in the case of traffic reports or your Carpool profile, or
just to your friends on Waze. This information may also be shared via third party services (such as social networks) which interact with the Services
upon such users’ choice.</p>

<p><strong>You can decide whether or not to upload content to the Services. However any content that you choose to share and submit for posting is neither
private nor confidential and you should expect that it may be made public and known to others.</strong> Information you choose to upload will be posted along
with your user name and other information including personal information you attached to your publicly available user profile . You should note that
certain road incidents you report may include your driving path within the vicinity of those incidents. Therefore, you must exercise caution and
common sense when submitting information. At the very least you should demonstrate the same degree of caution as when publishing personal information
by means other than the Internet and cellular services.</p>

<p>In any event (but except as detailed below with respect to information shared from your social network accounts according to your privacy settings for
such social network accounts), your email address will not be visible to others through any reports or user posts that you share or upload.</p>

<p>if you choose to either record your own voice onto the Service, or to use the voice command features, Waze will collect the voice information related
to such use, including voice files. If, after recording your own voice, you chose to share your voice recordings, other Waze users and other people
will be able to download and use your voice recordings. Once downloaded, Waze may not have any control over the voice files, so you should only share
content that you are comfortable being made public.</p>

<p>We, at Waze, take great measures to provide you with the best experience you can have while using the Services. However, Waze has no control over the
conduct of any user and disclaims all liability in this regard. Users are advised to carefully and thoroughly consider whether or not to make public
or available any information and carefully examine all necessary details related to any communication with other users prior to any engagement or
communication being made.</p>

<p>Participating in any user’s activities as a result, directly or indirectly, from using Waze, is entirely at your own risk. Waze is not a party to any
agreement entered into between the users in any circumstances. The user has the sole and ultimate responsibility regarding compliance with all laws,
regulations or any other duty. We do not accept any liability for any loss, damage, cost or expense that you may suffer or incur as a result of or in
connection with your participation in any activity or event initiated, held or conducted by a user or a third party nor in connection to any agreement
between the users or third parties, including any activity or event related in any way, directly or indirectly, the Services or the use thereof.</p>

<h3 id="when-waze-shares-your-information">When Waze shares your information</h3>

<p>Waze does not sell, rent or lease your personal information to third parties.</p>

<p>Waze will not share your personal information with others, without your permission, except for the following purposes and to the extent necessary in
Waze’s good-faith discretion:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As necessary for the facilitation and operation of the Services. For example, making public road incidents you report and which are associated with
your username and your location;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Waze reasonably believes that you have breached the Terms of Use or is investigating potential breach of the Terms of Use, or believes that you
abused your rights to use the Services, or performed any act or omission that Waze reasonably believes to be violating any applicable law, rules, or
regulations. Waze may share your information in these cases, with law enforcement agencies and other competent authorities and with any third party as
may be required to handle any result of your wrongdoing;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Waze is required, or reasonably believes that it is required by law to share or disclose your information;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any case of dispute, or legal proceeding of any kind between you and Waze, or between you and other users with respect to, or in relation with
the Services;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any case where Waze reasonably believes that sharing information is necessary to protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Waze,
our users, or the public as required or permitted by law, including to prevent imminent physical damage or damage to property;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Waze organizes the operation of the Services within a different framework, or through another legal structure or entity, or if Waze is acquired
by, or merged into or with another entity, or if Waze enters bankruptcy, provided however, that those entities agree to be bound by the provisions of
this Privacy Policy, with respective changes taken into consideration;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To collect, store, hold and manage your personal information through cloud based or hosting services or a third party or a party affiliated or
connected to Waze, as reasonable for business purposes, which may be located in the European Union and the U.S.A., potentially countries outside of
your jurisdiction;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Waze may also share personal information with companies or organizations connected or affiliated with Waze, such as subsidiaries, sister-companies
and parent companies (i.e. entities that belong to the Google group of companies);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We work with other Google’s services (such as Google Doubleclick Bid Manager) for advertising and ad measurement purposes. In order to help
advertisers decide what ads to show on Waze, Google, and websites &amp; apps that partner with Google, we may share information with these services, such
as a unique identifier for advertising (i.e, Advertising ID available on Android mobile devices or similar technologies). You can learn more about how
Google uses information from sites or apps that use its services and how you can control that in
<a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">this</a> page. For more information see section titled
<a href="#advertising-campaigns">‘Advertising campaigns’</a> under this Privacy Policy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also work with selected measurement services which help us understand how our users interact with our ads (such as DoubleClick Campaign Manager)
and in order to measure Waze’s own marketing efforts (such as AppsFlyer services), by using and sharing the device’s identifier (i.e, Advertising ID
or similar technologies).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Personal information may also be shared with Waze’s trusted partners and service providers to process it for us, based on our instructions and in
compliance with this policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help us with
customer services.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="visibility">Visibility</h1>

<p>Please note that your username and some other information will be visible to others. Note that your username will be included along with any
information you submit for posting (such as traffic reports or chat messages). It will therefore be visible to others.  Also - your friends on Waze
will see your name &amp; profile photo and any other information you chose to share with them.</p>

<p>If you prefer to remain invisible on the Waze map, you can set the Waze Application not to show your location on the map. To do so you should go to
the Privacy Settings and adjust accordingly by switching on to Invisible Mode. If on, <strong>some features may not be available</strong>.
If you make this choice, while you will be ‘invisible’ on the map to other users, your location and route information will continue to be collected by
Waze for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy and your Carpool profile (if you choose to set one) may be visible to other Waze’s users.</p>

<h1 id="integration-with-social-networks">Integration with social networks</h1>

<p>You may choose to share information between your Waze account and your social network account (such as Facebook). Through this option, you may choose
to have personal information and other content about you available from social networks, transmitted and shared through the Services. Similarly, you
may choose to have personal information and other content about you available from Waze, including your location and route information, transmitted to
and shared through your social network account.</p>

<p>By setting your Waze Account to integrate with social networks, including by signing onto Waze by using your social network account (such as your
Facebook account and your Google account), you agree to share information (including personal information) between Waze and such social networks, for
the purposes provided under this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>The social network’s use of information made available by Waze is governed by that social network’s privacy policy and controlled by the social
network, not by this Privacy Policy or Waze.</p>

<p>When you connect to the social network account through the Services for the first time or otherwise make the Services interact with your social
network account, you will be asked by the social network to permit the social network to share your personal information stored on such social network
with Waze. We collect your information from your social network account only in accordance with the permissions granted by you (such as your name,
email address, list of friends, profile picture and other information available via the applicable social network).</p>

<p>You understand and agree that the Services may access, make available and store such information so that it is available on and through your Waze
Account, until your Waze Account is deleted.</p>

<p>Please note that certain information which you have defined as private on your third party social network accounts may become public to other Waze
Users through the Services once you have allowed the social network to share such information with Waze (for example through your Carpool Profile).</p>

<h1 id="integration-with-other-third-party-services">Integration with other third party services</h1>

<p>Waze may offer you the option to link Waze to third party services that may be useful to you (like, Spotify). Where Waze detects an integration may be
available (either because a third party service attempts to link to Waze, or Waze detects an installed service on the device which has an integration
option, or you request a particular integration), Waze will ask for confirmation to connect the accounts. If you choose to connect the accounts, Waze
will ask for your permission to share data with the third party service. You should only agree to connect accounts if you are comfortable with the
third party service receiving the data set out at the time of connecting the accounts and Waze is not responsible for the third party service’s use of
data. You can disconnect Waze and the third party service at any time and Waze will cease sharing data with that service from the point of
disconnection onwards.</p>

<h1 id="controlling-your-personal-information">Controlling your personal information</h1>

<p>You can always review and update certain information by visiting your Account &amp; Login settings (such as your phone, email and more) or the in-app left
menu (to update your home, work and favorites).</p>

<p>You can log on to the Waze website to view your route history by going to “Edit the Map”/ “Drives” function on the Waze website. Note that in order to
access certain information you will need to set up a username. Your location and route history is associated with your Account and (if you have chosen
to set one up) your username or (if you have chosen not to set up a username) the unique identifier generated by Waze.</p>

<p>If you find that the information associated with your Account is not accurate, complete or updated, then you should make all necessary changes to
correct it. Please keep in mind that false, incorrect, or outdated information may prevent you from setting up a username and impair the ability to
provide you with Services.</p>

<h3 id="privacy-controls">Privacy controls</h3>

<p>Your in-app Privacy Settings provide you with quick access to settings and tools that let you safeguard your data and decide how your information can
make Waze services work better for you. For example, you can control your visibility on the map and manage your preferences about the ads shown to you
on Waze.</p>

<p>There are other ways to control the information Waze collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Waze Account, including device-level settings: your
device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your device.</p>

<h3 id="deleting-your-information">Deleting your information</h3>

<p>If you would like us to delete your Account, please use the “Delete Account” function available under the in-app Privacy Setting and on the
<a href="/dashboard">Waze website</a>. On receiving such a request, Waze will use reasonable efforts to delete such information, however please note
that information may not be deleted immediately from our back-up systems. We aim to initiate the deletion process immediately after your request. Once
we receive your request, your data will no longer be used to personalize your Waze experience. We then begin a process designed to safely and
completely delete the data from our storage systems. This process generally takes around 2 months from the time of deletion. As with any deletion
process, things like routine maintenance, unexpected outages, bugs, or failures in our protocols may cause delays in the processes and time frames
defined in this policy. We maintain systems designed to detect and remediate such issues.</p>

<h1 id="how-waze-retains-data-we-collect">How Waze retains data we collect</h1>

<p>Some data you can delete whenever you like, some data is deleted automatically, and some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary.
This section describes why we hold onto different types of data for different periods of time.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Information retained until you remove it</strong> - such as your “Home, “work”, favorites, email address and other account related information. We’ll
keep this data in your Waze Account until you choose to remove it and/or update it.</li>
  <li><strong>Data that expires after a specific period of time</strong> - in some cases, you don’t need to actively delete your information as we set retention
timeframes based on the reason for the data’s collection.  For example, if you choose to connect your calendar to your Waze Account, we extract your
calendar events for several days in advance and delete them after their occurrence. We may also take steps to anonymize certain data within
set timeperiods.</li>
  <li><strong>Information retained until your Waze Account is deleted</strong> - we may keep some data for the life of your Waze Account if it’s useful for helping us
understand how users interact with our features and how we can improve our services. For example, if you made an incident report, we will keep
information about how many reports you have submitted, even after the event is removed. When you delete your Waze Account, the information about how
many reports you have submitted is also removed.</li>
  <li><strong>Information retained for extended time periods for limited purposes</strong> - sometimes business and legal requirements oblige us to retain certain
information, for specific purposes, for an extended period of time. For example, when Waze processes a payment for you, we’ll retain this data for
longer periods of time as required for tax or accounting purposes. Reasons we might retain some data for extended periods of time include:
    <ul>
      <li>Security, fraud &amp; abuse prevention</li>
      <li>Financial record-keeping</li>
      <li>Complying with legal or regulatory requirements</li>
      <li>Ensuring the continuity of our services</li>
      <li>Direct communications with Waze</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="how-does-waze-use-aggregated-information">How does Waze use aggregated information?</h1>

<p>Waze may use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information (including anonymous location information), in a form that does not enable the
identification of a specific user, to properly operate the Services, to improve the quality of the Services, to enhance your experience, to create new
services and features, including customized services, to change or cancel existing content or service, and for further internal, commercial and
statistical purposes (including advertising).</p>

<p>Waze may also use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information collected on the Services, in a form that does not enable the identification of a
specific user, by posting, disseminating, transmitting or otherwise communicating or making available such information to users of the Services, to
the Services’ providers, partners and any other third party. For example, GPS information that we receive from your mobile device may be provided to
map editors in an aggregated and/or anonymous form to help improve the map and solve map problems, traffic data may be provided to cities, and
aggregated ads analysis may be provided to advertisers.</p>

<h1 id="cookies">Cookies</h1>

<p>Waze may use cookies and similar technologies on the Services. Cookies are packets of information sent by the Website’s servers to your web browser
and then sent back by the browser each time it accesses the Website’s servers.</p>

<p>Waze may use cookies for various purposes, such as to save you the need to re-enter your username and password each time you log in, to facilitate the
use of the Website, to collect statistical information, to verify information, and to customize the Website to your personal preferences and for
information security purposes.</p>

block the Website’s cookies, then please use the help button in your browser and follow the necessary instructions. However, bear in mind that
disabling cookies may complicate or even prevent your use of the Website, or certain features thereof.</p>

<h1 id="advertising-campaigns">Advertising campaigns</h1>

<p>Waze allows advertisers to run ad campaigns on the Services.</p>

<p>The information and advertisements that you see when accessing the Services may be targeted on the basis of your current Waze activity, such as your
current location, your destination or contextual information based on your current drive session. For example: if you search for “gas station” you may
see an ad for a local gas station.</p>

<p>Depending on your settings, you may also see <strong>ads personalized</strong> to you based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Information we received from you (for example, your saved “Home” &amp; “Work” addresses)</li>
  <li>Past activity and search query history (for example, drives that appear in your drive list)</li>
  <li>Information from our ad partners, including entities that belong to the Google group of companies and other trusted ad partners.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can decide whether we’ll show you personalized ads or not through your in-app <strong>Privacy Settings–&gt;Ads personalization</strong>. Note: turning Ads
personalization off does not turn off ads - only their personalization.</p>

<p>Please note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We don’t knowingly collect nor do we show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.</li>
  <li>We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you
see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and share your phone number with the flower shop.</li>
  <li>As described under “When Waze shares your information” section above, we work with other Google’s services (such as Google Doubleclick Bid Manager)
for advertising and ad measurement purposes. In order to help advertisers decide what ads to show on Waze, Google, and websites &amp; apps that partner
with Google, Waze may share information with these services such as a unique identifier for advertising (Advertising ID available on Android mobile
devices or similar technologies). You can learn more about how Google uses information from sites or apps that use its services and how you can
control that in <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">this page</a>.</li>
  <li>The Ads personalization control described above apply to personalized ads served by Waze <strong>on the Waze platform</strong> and they do not apply to ads
served on third parties platforms, including on Waze’s behalf.</li>
  <li>When you visit a third party website from the Application, such third party may use cookies on your computer. The third party’s use of cookies is
subject to their own privacy policies and not to this Privacy Policy. If you wish to study the privacy policies of those third parties you should
visit their services, or contact them directly.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Services includes an internal messaging system which provides you the ability to send and receive messages to and from other users, and to receive
marketing messages from us. You hereby agree that we may use the internal messaging system for the purpose of informing you regarding products or
services, which may interest you.</p>

<p>Please note however that other Waze users are not allowed to use your contact details or our internal messaging account for commercial advertising
purposes. If you have encountered any user generated advertising material, please inform us through the channels listed on the “About” menu in the
Software or through the “Contact Us” page on the Site <a href="/about/contact">link here</a>.</p>

<p>It is clarified that we are not responsible for the content of said advertisements and the products delivered or services rendered thereby by third
parties and you irrevocably and unconditionally agree that we shall not be held responsible or liable for any loss, damage, cost or expense that you
may suffer or incur as a result or in connection thereof.</p>

<h1 id="information-security">Information security</h1>

<p>Waze considers information security to be a top priority. Waze services are built with strong security features that continuously protect your
information. Waze implements systems, applications and procedures to secure your personal information, to minimize the risk of theft, damage, loss of
information, or unauthorized access or use of information. For example, we review our information collection, storage, and processing practices,
including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems. In addition, we restrict access to personal information to Waze
employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual
confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>

<p>The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you.</p>

<p>However, these measures are unable to provide absolute assurance. Therefore, although Waze takes great efforts to protect your personal information,
Waze cannot guarantee and you cannot reasonably expect that Waze’s databases will be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions
or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse.</p>

<h1 id="compliance-&amp;-cooperation-with-regulators">Compliance &amp; cooperation with regulators</h1>

<p>We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.</p>

<h3 id="data-transfers">Data transfers</h3>

<p>We store data on servers located around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data
protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the
same protections described in this policy.</p>

<p>When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory
authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with
you directly.</p>

<h3 id="european-requirements">European requirements</h3>

<p>If the European Union (EU) data protection law applies to the processing of your information, we provide the controls described in this policy so you

<p>We process your information for the purposes described in this policy, based on the following legal grounds:</p>

<p><em>With your consent</em></p>

<p>We ask for your agreement to process your information for specific purposes and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can
manage your settings at any time, including your in-app Privacy Settings.</p>
