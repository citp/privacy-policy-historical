  Waze Mobile Limited respects your privacy. Waze Mobile Limited and its
  affiliates (" Waze " or the "Company" ) offer mapping, GPS navigation and

<p>
  This Privacy Policy describes:-
</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the information that Waze collects from users;

</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the rights and options available to users.

<p>
  This Privacy Policy is incorporated as part of the Waze <a href="https://www.waze.com/legal/tos">Terms of Use</a>  (the " Terms of Use " or
  the " Terms ").
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Your use of the Services is subject to the Terms of Use, Copyright

  username for yourself. If you choose to use the Services without setting up a
  username you may do so by skipping the username setup stage of the application
  installation process. Waze will still link all of your information with your
  account and a unique identifier generated by Waze in accordance with this
  Privacy Policy. Note that in order to access certain features of the Services
  (for example as map editing, ranking, moods) you will need to set up a username.
</p>

    information;</li></ul>

  your name and gender.  Bear in mind that false, incorrect, or out-dated
  information may impair Waze's ability to provide you with the Services and to

</p>
<p>
  Waze may use information collected from or provided by you for the following
  purposes:
</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to  provide you with the Services. For example, Waze may:-
</p><ul>
  <li>use your location and route information and/or search query history to
    provide navigation services and to provide information and advertisements about
    sites, shops and other places and attractions in your close vicinity, or that we
    believe, based on your search query history and metadata, you may find
    interesting; and

    for more information.</li></ul>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to  operate the Services and to improve and customize your experience
  with the Services.  For example, Waze may use your "home" and "work" information
  or location history to offer routes based on how you've chosen to travel between
  favorite destinations in the past;
</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to  improve the experience of other users.  For example, Waze may use
  your route information to improve the accuracy of its mapping and navigation
  data;
</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to provide you with support and handle requests and complaints;
</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to send you updates, notices, announcements, and additional information
  related to the Services;
</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for advertising services, in accordance with the section titled
  'Advertising Campaigns' under this Privacy Policy. For example, Waze may use
  your location information to display advertisements for businesses in your close
  vicinity, or use your search terms to show you adverts for potentially relevant
  businesses;
</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;subject  to your prior indication of consent, we may also use the email
  address that you provide when setting up a username to send you marketing
  material.  At any time you may choose not to receive such material by:- (i)
  changing the email preferences in your Account accessed via the Website; or (ii)
  clicking on the "Unsubscribe" link in the e-mail messages that we may send to
  you. In any case, Waze will not knowingly share your personal information with
  any advertisers, without your explicit consent and as allowed for under this
  Privacy Policy;
</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to  create aggregated and/ or anonymous data (where such data does not
  enable the identification of a specific user).  See "How does Waze use
  aggregated information", below;
</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to conduct surveys and questionnaires;
</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to share your submissions with other users of the Services and to
  facilitate communication between you, Waze and other users;
</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to enforce the Terms of Use;
</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to contact you when Waze believes it to be necessary;
</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to comply with any applicable law and assist law enforcement agencies
  under any applicable law, when Waze has a good faith belief that Waze's
  cooperation with the law enforcement agencies is legally mandated or meets the
  applicable legal standards and procedures;
</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to prevent fraud, misappropriation, infringements, identity theft and
  other illegal activities and misuse of the Services;
</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to handle breakdowns and malfunctions;
</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to take any action in any case of dispute, or legal proceeding of any
  kind between you and the Service, or between you and other users or third
  parties with respect to, or in relation with the Service;
</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for  purposes provided under this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.
</p>
<p>
  Please note that the username you choose will be used to identify you when you
  use the Services. Your username will be included along with any information you
  submit for posting (such as traffic reports or chat messages). It will therefore
  be visible to others. If you prefer to remain invisible to other users of the
  Services for a particular drive, you can set the Application not to show your
  location on the map. To do so you should go to the Application Settings Menu and
  adjust accordingly. If you make this choice, while you will be invisible to
  other users, your location and route information will continue to be collected
  by Waze for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
  You may also provide additional information that will be used to personalize the
  Services and enhance your experience with the Services. For example, if you
  provide us with your "home" and "work" information, we may provide you with what
  we think is the shortest route between those locations.
</p>
<p>
  Further information may be collected when Waze exchanges communications with
  you, for example, if you submit a request, contact Waze's support team, or
  report a violation to the abuse team.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Personal information that you share</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The Services are based on a community of users publicly sharing information with
  Waze and with other members of that community.
</p>
<p>
  In particular, users choose to share personal information such as name, age,
  gender, picture, their location information, reports and other files.  This
  information may be shared either directly to the Service and to all users, such
  as in the case of traffic reports, or just to your friends on Waze via the 'find
  friends' feature .  This information may also be shared   via  third party
  services (such as social networks) which interact with the Service upon such
  users' choice.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>The content that you share to all users is neither private nor
    confidential and you should not have any expectation of privacy with respect to
    it.</strong> Information you upload will be posted along with other personal
  information. Certain road incidents you report may include your driving path
  within the vicinity of those incidents. Therefore, you must exercise caution and
  common sense when submitting information. At the very least you should
  demonstrate the same degree of caution as when publishing personal information
  by means other than the Internet and cellular services.
</p>
<p>
  You can decide whether or not to upload content to the Services. However any
  content that you submit for posting, may be viewed by all users of the Services
  and by Waze.
</p>
<p>
  In any event (but except as detailed below with respect to information shared
  from your social network accounts according to your privacy settings for such
  social network accounts), your email address will not be visible to others
  through any reports or user posts that you share or upload.
</p>
<p>
  Waze collects voice information, including voice files if you either record your
  own voice, or use the voice command features  If, after recording your own
  voice, you chose to share your voice recordings, other Waze users and other
  people will be able to download and use your voice recordings. Once downloaded,
  Waze may not have any control over the voice files, so you should only share
  content that you are comfortable being made public.
</p>
<p>
  We, at Waze, take great measures to provide you with the best experience you can
  have while using the Service. However, Waze has no control over the conduct of
  any user and disclaims all liability in this regard. Users are advised to
  carefully and thoroughly consider whether or not to make public or available any
  information and carefully examine all necessary details related to any
  communication with other users prior to any engagement or communication being
  made.
</p>
<p>
  Participating in any user's activities as a result, directly or indirectly, from
  using Waze, is entirely at your own risk. Waze is not a party to any agreement
  entered into between the users in any circumstances. The user has the sole and
  ultimate responsibility regarding compliance with all laws, regulation or any
  other duty. We do not accept any liability for any loss, damage, cost or expense
  that you may suffer or incur as a result of or in connection with your
  participation in any activity or event initiated, held or conducted by a user or
  a third party nor in connection to any agreement between the users or third
  parties, including any activity or event related in any way, directly or
  indirectly, the Services or the use thereof.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Integration with social networks</strong>
</p>
<p>
  You may choose to share information between your Account and your social network
  account (such as Facebook). Through this option, you may choose to have personal
  information and other content about you available from social networks,
  transmitted and shared through the Services. Similarly, you may choose to have
  personal information and other content about you available from Waze, including
  your location and route information, transmitted to and shared through your
  social network account.
</p>
<p>
  By setting your Account to integrate with social networks including by signing
  onto Waze by using your social network account (such as your Facebook  account),
  you agree to share information (including personal information) between Waze and
  such social networks, for the purposes provided under this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
  The social network's use of information made available by Waze is governed by
  that social network's privacy policy and controlled by the social network, not
  by this Privacy Policy or Waze.
</p>
<p>
  When you connect to the social network account through the Services for the
  first time or otherwise make the Services interact with your social network
  account, you will be asked to permit the social network to share your personal
  information stored on such social network with the Services. We collect your
  information from your social network account only in accordance with your
  privacy settings you have set up under your social network accounts.
</p>
<p>
  Accordingly we only collect such information which you allowed the social
  network(s) to share with third parties (such as your name, email address, list
  of friends, profile picture, other information you make publicly available via
  the applicable social network). You understand that the Services may access,
  make available and store (if applicable and as permitted by the third party
  social network and authorized by you) such information so that it is available
  on and through your Account.  For example, Waze may allow you to share your
  location with your Facebook friends, via the Application.
</p>
<p>
  Please note that certain information which you have defined as private on your
  third party social network accounts may become public to other Waze Users
  through the Services if you have defined such information to be public on the
  Services. For example, if you designate your social network username as
  "private"in your social network account (to the extent possible under said
  settings), but have elected to set your Waze account settings as public, then
  the username will become public on the Waze service.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Integration with other third party services</strong>

<p>
  Waze offers you the option to link Waze to third party services that may be
  useful to you. Where Waze detects an integration may be available (either
  because a third party service attempts to link to Waze, or Waze detects an
  installed service on the device which has an integration option), Waze will ask
  for confirmation to connect the accounts. If you choose to connect the accounts
  and  after connecting, Waze will ask for your permission to share data with the
  third party service. You should only agree to connect accounts if you are
  comfortable with the third party service receiving the data set out at the time
  of connecting the accounts  and Waze is not responsible for the third party
  service's use of data. You can disconnect Waze and the third party service at
  any time and Waze will cease sharing data with that service.
</p>
<p>

  regulations. Waze may share your information in these cases, with law
  enforcement agencies and other competent authorities and with any third party as
  may be required to handle any result of your wrongdoing;
</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If Waze is required, or reasonably believes that it is required by law to
  share or disclose your information;
</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In any case of dispute, or legal proceeding of any kind between you and
  Waze, or between you and other users with respect to, or in relation with the
  Services;

<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In any case where Waze reasonably believes that sharing information is
  necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or damage to property;
</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If Waze organizes the operation of the Services within a different
  framework, or through another legal structure or entity, or if Waze is acquired
  by, or merged into or with another entity, or if Waze enters bankruptcy,
  provided however, that those entities agree to be bound by the provisions of
  this Privacy Policy, with respective changes taken into consideration;
</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For facilitating the Service and to store your data on servers located in

</p>
<p>
  ● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waze may also share personal information with companies or organizations
  connected or affiliated with Waze, such as subsidiaries, sister-companies and
  parent companies. Personal information may also be shared with Waze's other
  partners and service providers to process it for us, based on our instructions
  and in compliance with this policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and
  security measures.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Controlling your personal information</strong>
</p>
<p>
  If you would like us to delete your Account, your username (if you have set one
  up) and your personal information, please use the "Delete Account" function we
  offer available under the Settings menu in the Application and on the Website.
</p>
<p>
  On receiving such a request, Waze will use reasonable efforts to delete such
  information, however please note we may not delete information immediately from
  our back-up systems.
</p>
<p>
  If you choose to set up a username, you can view your route history via the
  "Edit the Map"/ "Drives" function on the Waze website.
</p>
<p>
  Your location and route history is associated with your Account and (if you have
  chosen to set one up) your username or (if you have chosen not to set up a
  username) the unique identifier generated by Waze.
</p>
<p>
  This information is held by Waze associated with your Account and username/
  unique identifier for such limited period of time as is necessary in order for
  Waze to be able to use the information for the purposes described in this
  Privacy Policy. At the end of this period of time, Waze will then anonymize or
  delete your location and route information.
</p>
<p>
  If you find that the information associated with your Account is not accurate,
  complete or updated, then you must make all necessary changes to correct it.
  Please keep in mind that false, incorrect, or outdated information may prevent
  you from setting up a username and impair the ability to provide you with
  Services.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>How does Waze use aggregated information?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Waze may use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information (including
  anonymous location information), in a form that does not enable the
  identification of a specific user, to properly operate the Services, to improve
  the quality of the Services, to enhance your experience, to create new services
  and features, including customized services, to change or cancel existing
  content or service, and for further internal, commercial and statistical
  purposes (including advertising).
</p>
<p>
  Waze may also use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information collected on
  the Services, in a form that does not enable the identification of a specific
  user, by posting, disseminating, transmitting or otherwise communicating or
  making available such information to users of the Services, to the Services'
  providers, partners and any other third party.  For example, GPS information
  that we receive from your mobile device may be provided to map editors in an
  aggregated and/ or anonymous form to help improve the map and solve map
  problems, traffic data may be provided to cities, and anonymous ads analysis may
  be provided to advertisers.
</p>

  security purposes.

  advertising campaigns on the Services.

  targeted on the basis of your search query history or on the basis of
  information received from third party partners, you are able to opt out of such
  targeting in the settings of the Application. See <a href="https://support.google.com/waze/answer/6174383">here</a> for more detail.

  use cookies on your computer. The third party's use of cookies is subject to
  their own privacy policies and not to this Privacy Policy.  If you wish to study
  the privacy policies of those third parties you should visit their services, or
  contact them directly.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  The Service includes an internal messaging system which provides you the ability
  to send and receive messages to and from other users, and to receive marketing
  messages from us.  You hereby agree that we may use the internal messaging
  system for the purpose of informing you regarding products or services, which
  may interest you.
</p>
<p>
  Please note however that other Waze users are not allowed to use your contact
  details or our internal messaging account for commercial advertising purposes.
  If you have encountered any user generated advertising material, please inform
  us through the channels listed on the "About" menu in the Software or through
  the "Contact Us" page on the Site (web address: <a href="https://support.google.com/waze">support.google.com/waze</a> ). Waze does
  not accept any liability for any loss, damage, cost or expense that you may
  suffer or incur as a result of or in connection with any user's advertising
  material.
</p>
<p>
  It is clarified that we are not responsible for the content of said
  advertisements and the products delivered or services rendered thereby by third
  parties and you irrevocably and unconditionally agree that we shall not be held
  responsible or liable in connection thereof.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Information Security</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Waze considers information security to be a top priority. Waze implements
  systems, applications and procedures to secure your personal information, to
  minimize the risks of theft, damage, loss of information, or unauthorized access
  or use of information. However, these measures are unable to provide absolute
  assurance. Therefore, although Waze takes great efforts to protect your personal
  information, Waze cannot guarantee and you cannot reasonably expect that Waze's
  databases will be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful
  interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse.
</p>
<p>

    pages, explaining the changes to the Privacy Policy alongside a comparison of
    the "old" and "new" versions of the Privacy Policy.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Other changes will take effect 7 days after their initial posting on the
    Website. However, if Waze amends this Privacy Policy to comply with legal
    requirements, the amendments will become effective immediately upon their
    initial posting, or as required.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>You agree to be bound by any of the changes made in the terms of this
    Privacy Policy. Continuing to use the Services will indicate your acceptance of
    the amended terms. If you do not agree with any of the amended terms, you must
    avoid any further use of the Services.</strong>
