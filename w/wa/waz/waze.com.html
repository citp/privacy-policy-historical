    <span><strong>Information that is being collected</strong></span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>Waze allows you to use the Services whether or not you choose to set up a username for yourself.</span>
    <span>If you choose to use the Services without setting up a username you may do so by skipping the username setup stage of the application installation process. Waze will still link all of your information with your account and a unique identifier generated by Waze in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Note that in order to access certain features of the Services (for example as map editing, ranking, moods) you will need to set up a username.</span>
</p>

</p>
<p>

    <span>will</span>
    <span>&nbsp;collect:-</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;detailed location and route information, for example in the form of GPS signals and other information sent by your mobile device on which the Application is installed and activated. &nbsp;Waze uses this location and route information to create a detailed location history of all of the journeys you have made while using the Application; and</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;information about your use of the Services. &nbsp;See “Meta-data that we collect”, below;</span>

    <span>&nbsp;also collect:-</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>

</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span>periodically, all of the phone numbers which are stored on your device’s phone</span>
        <span>book</span>
        <span>. We only collect numbers</span>
        <span>in a form which is anonymous to Waz</span>
        <span>e, we will not collect names, addresses or other information from your device's phone book. This information will be used as part of the ‘find friends’ feature to help find and create a list of other Waze users who you may know and with whom you may wish to connect; and/ or</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>your phone number. Your phone number will be used to verify your account and as part of the ‘find friends’ feature to help find and create a list of other Waze users who you may know and with whom you may wish to connect. &nbsp;See <a href="https://support.google.com/waze/answer/6100208">here</a> </span>

    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;information required when setting up a username you have chosen, such as your name and gender. &nbsp;Bear in mind that false, incorrect, or out-dated information may impair Waze's ability to provide you with the Services and to contact you when necessary. Waze will explicitly indicate the fields for mandatory completion. If you do not enter the requisite data in these fields, you may not be able to set up a username; and/ or</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;information shared from your social network accounts. See “Integration with social networks”, below.</span>

    <span>Please note that when you first install the Application on your mobile device, Waze will set up an account associated with that mobile device (the</span>
    <span>“Account”</span>
    <span>).</span>
    <span>&nbsp;</span>
    <span>Waze will collect and use your information, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, whenever you activate the Application on that mobile device. &nbsp;This use includes linking your information with your Account. &nbsp;This is the case irrespective of whether or not you choose to create a Waze username and password in the Application.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>In order to access certain features of the Services (for example, map editing, ranking, moods), you will need to set up a username.</span>

    <span>Waze will link all of your information with your Account</span>

    <span>&nbsp;that username. &nbsp;This includes information received from all mobile devices running the Application on which you have chosen to sign in using your username and password;</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
    <span>with the exception described in the bullet below, your Account and information associated with your Account will be visible only to Waze; and</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
    <span>when using the Application, your approximate location and other information you may choose to contribute will be visible to other users associated with that username.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>If you</span>

    <span>&nbsp;set up a Waze username and password in the Application (by skipping the username setup stage of the application installation process):-</span>

    <span>Waze will still link all of your information with your Account</span>
    <span>and</span>
    <span>&nbsp;a unique identifier generated by Waze;</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
    <span>with the exception described in the bullet below, your Account and information associated with your Account (including your unique identifier) will be visible only to Waze; and</span>

<p>
    <span>&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span><strong>Uses of information</strong></span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>Waze may use information collected from or provided by you for the following purposes:</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
    <span>&nbsp;</span>
    <span>to</span>
    <span>&nbsp;provide you with the Services. For example, Waze may:-</span>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span>use your location and route information and/or search query history to provide navigation services and to provide information and advertisements about sites, shops and other places and attractions in your close vicinity, or that we believe, based on your search query history, you may find interesting; and</span>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span>(if you have opted in to</span>
        <span>the ‘find friends’ feature),</span>
        <span>use your phone number and the phone numbers which are stored in your device’s phone book to find and create a list of other Waze users who you may know and with whom you may wish to connect. &nbsp;See <a href="https://support.google.com/waze/answer/6100208">here</a></span>
        <span>&nbsp;for more information.</span>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <span></span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
    <span>to</span>
    <span>&nbsp;operate the Services and to improve and customize your experience with the Services. &nbsp;For example, Waze may use your “home” and “work” information or location history to offer routes based on how you’ve chosen to travel between favorite destinations in the past;</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
    <span>to</span>
    <span>&nbsp;improve the experience of other users. &nbsp;For example, Waze may use your route information to improve the accuracy of its mapping and navigation data;</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to provide you with support and handle requests and complaints;</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to send you updates, notices, announcements, and additional information related to the Services;</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
    <span>to</span>
    <span>&nbsp;display or send to you marketing and advertising material when you are using the Application, in accordance with the section titled 'Advertising Campaigns' under this Privacy Policy. For example, Waze may use your location information to display advertisements for businesses in your close vicinity;</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
    <span>subject</span>
    <span>&nbsp;to your prior indication of consent, we may also use the email address that you provide when setting up a username to send you marketing material. &nbsp;At any time you may choose not to receive such material by:- (i) changing the email preferences in your Account accessed via the Website; or (ii) clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link in the e-mail messages that we may send to you. In any case, Waze will not knowingly share your personal information with any advertisers, without your explicit consent and as allowed for under this Privacy Policy;</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
    <span>to</span>
    <span>&nbsp;create aggregated and/ or anonymous data (where such data does not enable the identification of a specific user). &nbsp;See “How does Waze use aggregated information”, below;</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to conduct surveys and questionnaires;</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to share your submissions with other users of the Services and to facilitate communication between you, Waze and other users;</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to enforce the Terms of Use;</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to contact you when Waze believes it to be necessary;</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to comply with any applicable law and assist law enforcement agencies under any applicable law, when Waze has a good faith belief that Waze’s cooperation with the law enforcement agencies is legally mandated or meets the applicable legal standards and procedures;</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to prevent fraud, misappropriation, infringements, identity theft and other illegal activities and misuse of the Services;</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to handle breakdowns and malfunctions;</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to take any action in any case of dispute, or legal proceeding of any kind between you and the Service, or between you and other users or third parties with respect to, or in relation with the Service;</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>● &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
    <span>for</span>
    <span>&nbsp;purposes provided under this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>Please note that the username you choose will be used to identify you when you use the Services. Your username will be included along with any information you submit for posting (such as traffic reports or chat messages). It will therefore be visible to others. If you prefer to remain invisible to other users of the Services for a particular drive, you can set the Application not to show your location on the map. To do so you should go to the Application Settings Menu and adjust accordingly. If you make this choice, while you will be invisible to other users, your location and route information will continue to be collected by Waze for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>You may also provide additional information that will be used to personalize the Services and enhance your experience with the Services. For example, if you provide us with your "home" and "work" information, we may provide you with what we think is the shortest route between those locations.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>Further information may be collected when Waze exchanges communications with you, for example, if you submit a request, contact Waze's support team, or report a violation to the abuse team.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span><strong>Personal information that you share</strong></span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>The Services are based on a community of users publicly sharing information with Waze and with other members of that community. &nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>In particular, users choose to share personal information such as name, age, gender, picture, their location information and reports. &nbsp;This information may be shared either directly to the Service</span>
    <span>and to all users, such as in the case of traffic reports, or just to your friends on Waze via</span>
    <span>the ‘find friends’ feature</span>
    <span>. &nbsp;This information may also be shared</span>
    <span>&nbsp;</span>
    <span>via</span>
    <span>&nbsp;third party services (such as social networks) which interact with the Service upon such users' choice.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The content that you share to all users is neither private nor confidential
    and you should not have any expectation of privacy with respect to it.</strong>
    <span>Information you upload will be posted along with other personal information. Certain road incidents you report may include your driving path within the vicinity of those incidents. Therefore, you must exercise caution and common sense when submitting information. At the very least you should demonstrate the same degree of caution as when publishing personal information by means other than the Internet and cellular services.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>You can decide whether or not to upload content to the Services. However any content that you submit for posting, may be viewed by all users of the Services and by Waze.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>In any event (but except as detailed below with respect to information shared from your social network accounts according to your privacy settings for such social network accounts), your email address will not be visible to others through any reports or user posts that you share or upload.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>We, at Waze, take great measures to provide you with the best experience you can have while using the Service. However, Waze has no control over the conduct of any user and disclaims all liability in this regard. Users are advised to carefully and thoroughly consider whether or not to make public or available any information and carefully examine all necessary details related to any communication with other users prior to any engagement or communication being made.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>Participating in any user's activities as a result, directly or indirectly, from using Waze, is entirely at your own risk. Waze is not a party to any agreement entered into between the users in any circumstances. The user has the sole and ultimate responsibility regarding compliance with all laws, regulation or any other duty. We do not accept any liability for any loss, damage, cost or expense that you may suffer or incur as a result of or in connection with your participation in any activity or event initiated, held or conducted by a user or a third party nor in connection to any agreement between the users or third parties, including any activity or event related in any way, directly or indirectly, the Services or the use thereof.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span><strong>Integration with social networks</strong></span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>You may choose to share information between your Account and your social network account (such as Facebook). Through this option, you may choose to have personal information and other content about you available from social networks, transmitted and shared through the Services. Similarly, you may choose to have personal information and other content about you available from Waze, including your location and route information, transmitted to and shared through your social network account.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>By setting your Account to integrate with social networks including by signing onto Waze by using your social network account (such as your</span>
    <span>Facebook</span>
    <span>&nbsp;account), you agree to share information (including personal information) between Waze and such social networks, for the purposes provided under this Privacy Policy.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>The social network's use of information made available by Waze is governed by that social network's privacy policy and controlled by the social network, not by this Privacy Policy or Waze.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>When you connect to the social network account through the Services for the first time or otherwise make the Services interact with your social network account, you will be asked to permit the social network to share your personal information stored on such social network with the Services. We collect your information from your social network account only in accordance with your privacy settings you have set up under your social network accounts.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span>Accordingly we only collect such information which you allowed the social network(s) to share with third parties (such as your name, email address, list of friends, profile picture, other information you make publicly available via the applicable social network). You understand that the Services may access, make available and store (if applicable and as permitted by the third party social network and authorized by you) such information so that it is available on and through your Account. &nbsp;For example, Waze may allow you to share your location with your Facebook friends, via the Application.</span>
