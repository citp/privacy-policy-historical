**Waze Privacy Policy**  


Thank you for visiting the Waze Service and [www.waze.com](http://www.waze.com/) (the "Site"). 

The mission of Waze is to enable drivers and users to build updated maps and road information services to create a better driving experience for everyone.

Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains our information practices in connection with your personal information. 

Please read the full terms of this Privacy Policy below, as they govern the privacy issues in connection with the Waze Service. For your convenience, here are some key points:

  * You are not required to provide any personal information to use the Site.


  * If you wish to use our software, the only personal information we require from you is a mobile phone number and email. We use the phone number to send you the link to the Waze software and then we delete it. We use the email to provide support and send product and service updates. 


  * You have the choice whether to provide additional personal information to us. We use that information to provide you personalized services, such as the shortest route between work and home, and improve our services to you. 


  * Your public profile will include information that does NOT personally identify you, such as your gender, age, city and state. You can delete this profile if you wish. 


  * We may display information that does NOT personally identify you, such as your nickname, avatar, mood icon, and driving route and distance. You can turn this off from the mobile client and be totally anonymous.


  * The Waze Service is for those over 13.



This Privacy Policy forms part of the Terms of Use, available at [www.waze.com/terms](http://www.waze.com/terms). The "Waze Service" shall mean the Site, the software provided for download through the Site and any related servers. 

**Introduction**  


"Personal Information" means any information that may be used to identify you, such as a first and last name, a home, work or other physical address, phone number, email address, date of birth, car information, and information about your yourself, such as your driving routes. 

We do not require you to provide Personal Information to use the Waze Service. However, for certain services, you must create an account ("Account") and provide us with your mobile phone number and an email. We use your phone number to send you a text message containing a link to download software and including a nickname and password. We then delete your phone number. We encourage you to personalize your Account by changing your password, and changing your nickname to one that does not identify you personally. 

**The Way We Use Personal Information**  


You are not required to submit any Personal Information to us. If you do choose to submit Personal Information to us, then we will use it to send you updates, to improve our services to you, recommend the shortest routes between work and home, to contact you and to authenticate your access to our services.

We may display information that does NOT personally identify you, such as your nickname, avatar, mood icon, and driving route and distance. You can turn this off from the mobile client and be totally anonymous.  


We may provide aggregate information, which is NOT personally identifiable, to third parties.   


We may also use your email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding our services. 

Finally, we may disclose your Personal Information if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce our Terms of Use including investigations of potential violations thereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Waze, its users, yourself or the public. 

**Cookies**  





Our Waze Service may use "cookies" and other tracking technologies to recall your Personal Information and provide you a personalized experience. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about Waze Service activity.   


You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. 

**Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites**  


The Waze Service may use a reputable third party to serve advertisements on the Waze Service. These third parties will often serve geographically or contextually targeted ads. They are subject to their own privacy policies and are not covered by our Privacy Policy. 

**Links to Other Sites**  


The Waze Service may contain links to other sites. Other sites may also link to our Site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other sites.

**Children's Privacy**  


The Waze Service is not structured to attract children under the age of 13. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 13 years of age. 

**Merger, Sale or Bankruptcy**  


In the event that Waze is acquired by or merged with a third party, we may transfer the information we have collected from our users as part of such transaction. In the event of our bankruptcy or similar events, we may not be able to control how your Personal Information is used.

**Commitment**  


We are committed to protecting your privacy. Protecting your privacy online is an evolving area, and the Waze Service is constantly evolving to meet these demands. If you have any comments or questions regarding our Privacy Policy, please contact us at [privacy@waze.com](mailto:privacy@waze.com). **While we cannot guarantee privacy perfection, we will address any issue to the best of our abilities.**
