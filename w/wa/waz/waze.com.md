# Waze: Way to go

**Please a note,** [an updated privacy policy](https://web.archive.org/legal/next_privacy/) will replace this one on December 20, 2012 

**_Waze – privacy policy_**

Waze Inc. respects your privacy. This policy explains the privacy practices of Waze Inc. (" **Waze** ") on [www.Waze.com](http://www.waze.com/) (the " **Website** ") and with respect to Waze's mobile application (the " **Application** ") (collectively referred to as " **the Services** "). It describes how Waze collects and uses your personal information and the rights and options available to you. 

This policy is incorporated to the Waze's [Terms of Use](http://www.waze.com/legal/tos) (the " **Terms of Use** " or the " **Terms** "). 

Waze follows the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (" **CTIA** ")'s Best Practices and Guidelines for Location-Based Services. For a better understanding of CTIA's guidelines, please visit CTIA's website at: [www.ctia.org](http://www.ctia.org/). 

The Services are not intended for use by persons under the age of 13. If you are under 13, you may not download or use the Application, you may not use any feature of the Website that requires registration and you may not provide us with any of your personal details. Waze will not knowingly collect any personal information of persons under 13.

In this policy, the term 'personal information' (or 'personally identifiable information') means any information that, with reasonable efforts, may be used to identify you, such as a first and last name, home address and email address. 

**Contact Waze / Abuse reports**

If you believe that your privacy has been compromised by any person, in the course of using the Services, then please contact Waze at: [privacy@waze.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20121213061029id_/http://www.waze.com/legal/privacy/mailtprivacy@waze.com). 

You may send Waze other requests, responses, questions and complaints by email at [support@waze.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20121213061029id_/http://www.waze.com/legal/privacy/mailtsupport@waze.com). 

**Personal information that you provide**

When you register with the Services, Waze may ask you to provide certain contact and personal details, such as mobile device number and e-mail address. Bear in mind that false, incorrect, or out dated information may impair Waze's ability to provide you with the Services and to contact you when necessary. Waze will explicitly indicate the fields for mandatory completion. If you do not enter the requisite data in these fields, you may not be able to register with the Services. 

Please note that the username you choose will be used to identify you when you register and use the Services. Your username will be included along with any information you submit for posting (such as traffic reports or chat messages). It will therefore be visible to others. If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can set the Application not to expose your username. Please consult the configuration options of the Application for exact settings.

You may also provide additional personal information that will be used to personalize the Services, for example by providing you the shortest route between work and home, and enhance your experience with the Services. 

If you do not wish to sign up when installing the Application, you can choose the option "Not Now", which creates a temporary anonymous Waze account. Using such an account allows you to use the application anonymously. However, this kind of account won't let you use certain parts of the Website or gain credit-points during your use of the Application.

Further information, such as your waze rank, waze points amount, nickname, avatar, mood icon, driving route and distance may be used and shared with other users, when you use the Application. At all times, except for your waze rank and waze points that cannot be turned off, you can turn the transmission of all other details off and share no details at all. 

Further information may be collected when Waze exchange communications with you, for example, if you submit a request, contact Waze's support team, or report a violation to the abuse team. 

**Personal information that you share**

The Services are based on users' locations and submissions that may include personal information. You may upload and share content, such as traffic reports, with other users of the Services. The content that you submit is neither private nor confidential and you should not have any expectation of privacy with respect to it. 

Information you upload will be posted along with other personally identifiable information. Certain road incidents you report may include your driving path within the vicinity of those incidents. Therefore, you must exercise caution and common sense when submitting information. At the very least you should demonstrate the same degree of caution as when publishing personal information by means other than the Internet and cellular services.

You can decide whether or not to upload content to the Services. However any content that you submit for posting, may be viewed by all users of the Services and by Waze. 

Waze may make certain content that you submit, viewable to all Internet users.

In any event, your email address will not be visible to others through any reports or user posts that you share or upload.

**Location based information that we collect**

Waze may make further use of your location information by providing you information about sites, shops and other places and attractions in your close vicinity. 

Waze may also use your location information to create aggregated anonymous data and to use such data in accordance with this policy (please refer to use of aggregated information chapter hereunder). Waze will make commercially reasonable efforts to permanently remove or obscure your identity from your location information that is used for aggregated purposes. 

**Opting out of location information services by uninstalling the Application**
