The World Anti-Doping Agency (“WADA”) takes your privacy seriously. This website privacy policy (the “Policy”) explains how WADA uses personal information collected through the public sections of [www.wada-ama.org](http://www.wada-ama.org/) (“Website”). This policy does not cover how WADA collects and handles information gathered through the ADAMS Database.

## Personal Information We Collect

We collect the following types of personal information via our Website:

  * Information relating to your use of the Website and the device you use to access the Website, through cookies and other similar technologies; and

WADA may use the personal information collected through this Website: 

  * To operate the Website; 
  * To improve the Website and to make WADA’s operations better and more effective; 
  * For any purpose you clearly intend when submitting the information to us (i.e. reviewing a job application, or replying to your email to us). 



WADA won’t use your personal information for any direct marketing or unsolicited follow-up unless you have first been informed of, and expressly consented to, this use.

WADA will collect and store your personal information in Canada and/or Switzerland, where WADA is established. Personal information we store in Canada or Switzerland is subject to applicable Canadian, Quebec and Swiss data protection and privacy laws. European users should note that both Switzerland and, to a more limited extent, Canada, have been deemed by the European Commission to be jurisdictions that provide adequate levels of legal protection for privacy.
