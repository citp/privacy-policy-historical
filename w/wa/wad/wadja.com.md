**About Wadja**

Wadja Media Limited develops services that make the message distribution process easier across multiple devices and platforms. Wadja Media is deeply committed to enhancing the social networking experience by providing mechanisms to deliver real time information across the web and remove the 'noise' associated with multiple streams of conversation (pages) by delivering focused social, keyword, semantic value to subscribers (label followers)

Wadja Media Limited owns and operates www.wadja.com, a unique messaging service based on shared topics of page and activities. Use Wadja.com to follow profile "labels" that focus around the hobbies and group discussions you enjoy most.)

Page conversations can take place over the Web, Email and SMS, and the responses are shared between contacts, or privately with a friend.

Wadja cares deeply about online privacy. If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at [privacy@wadja.com](mailto:privacy@wadja.com).

**Information Collection and Use by Wadja**

Wadja collects user submitted information such as name, email address, and age to authenticate users and to send notifications to those users relating to the Wadja service. Wadja also collects other profile data including but not limited to: personal pages, gender, age, mobile number and location in order to assist users in finding and communicating with each other.

Wadja also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to the site. This data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the website services. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to members. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.

User Profile information including members' pictures and first names are displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction in the Wadja social networking and media community. Email addresses and mobile numbers are used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join Wadja , to add users to members contact networks, and to send notifications related to the service. With the exception of inviting friends, adding friends, and notifications, a user's email address is not shared or displayed to people within a user's personal network.

Many of Wadja 's services work with SMS messaging. You can earn free points and use them to send text (sms) messages to a mobile number. Likewise Wadja provides a messaging service through SMS Gateways providers that allow registered Wadja users to send SMS by adding a + symbol, a mobile country code, and the number of the message recipient.

This service is strictly offered to Wadja members and as a Graphical User Interface between the web and Gateway Providers. Wadja provides this interface to all users who have verified their email and mobile number account and in no way assumes any responsibility for the actions of individual users and their messaging habits. Any reports of abuse will result in Wadja discontinuing user’s accounts without any notification whatsoever. Each user takes FULL RESPONSIBILITY for the destination and content of each and every message they send through the Wadja GUI web interface.

Wadja's SMS messaging service is strictly optional and Wadja is in no way liable or responsible for any misrepresentation or misuse of mobile phone numbers or wrong mobile numbers. Wadja will never use our SMS messaging service for SMS spamming or telemarketing. However, some SMS providers who offer free services in your region may be ad-supported. If you use these services you agree to their terms and conditions. Wadja may also include Message Ads within notifications and email alerts and private messaging between friends in and outside of the network. Any user sending SMS messages through the Wadja GUI interface understands that they are responsible, as senders, for any complaints or disputes that a recipient may have with the advertisements that accompany the message. Wadja users do not have to use the free service and understand that ad supported messaging provides them with free message sending rights.

Keep in mind that you can make your mobile number invisible to your contact list, but still receive messages, since your contacts only see your Wadja ID as a 'Send to' option in their SMS contact list. Your mobile number will only be available to your contacts in your network. Wadja assumes no responsibility, nor is legally liable for any damage, whether personal or professional, for any late delivery or failed delivery of SMS messages.

Should you decide to display mobile phone number to your contact list, Wadja is in no way legally liable or responsible for any misuse or abuse of your displayed mobile phone number. You always have the choice to make your mobile number visible or invisible by choosing Everyone, Friends or No One in the 'Make your mobile visible to…' box, found in your ACCOUNT, My account, Notify and Verify section of the service. If you choose ‘No One’ from the list people can send you SMS but they cannot see your number from your Profile page. Of course you can remove your number altogether, which would still let you send SMS to your contact list but not receive SMS from then in return. You can always select the types of SMS alerts you want to receive by going to ACCOUNT (My Account, Notify and Verify) section after you sign in, and choosing the check box alert notifications accordingly.

Users within a personal network communicate on Wadja with each other through Wadja.com , without disclosing their personal email addresses. Upon registration each member is allocated a personal Wadja domain URL (http://wadja.com/'yourname') and a personal Wadja email address ('yourname'@wadja.com) Users' full names are never directly revealed to other members unless full names are added in their personal details section. To facilitate searching and finding friends and acquaintances on the service, Wadja allows users to search for other members using their Wadja ID, first and last name, and email address.

Upon sign up, a users first two pages are already shown (your location and profile photo). A variety of other System Pages are provided to help users archive and organize their social content and streams of real-time communication.

System pages are set by Wadja and determine what pages the user will automatically receive. Wadja ’s system pages are Notes, Message, Location and a few more.

Be aware that "Notes" and some other System Pages on Wadja are available for everyone to see. Whether you send a Note @someone or just update your Notes on a label or your profile, the notes are publicly available and will be displayed for everyone to see. Do not post notes that are private or sensitive to yourself or another user. If you wish to write something private to another users or contacts, use the @ symbol to send a private message.

You can change who views your pages and the "Everyone" settings by going to the SETTING (Pages) page. Here you can choose whom you would like to make the labels available to: No one, only me, custom, or everyone.

We may also use a user's email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding the service. Users may choose not to receive email of this type by changing their notification setting to not receive notification emails or SMS messages in the user SETTINGS (Notify and Verify) section.

From time to time, Wadja or a partner, may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on the Wadja web properties. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply.

**Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members**

Wadja members can invite friends to join the service by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system.

Wadja does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations, invitation reminders (up to three(3) per email address). Recipients of invitations from Wadja may contact Wadja to request the removal of their information from our database.

Wadja members may also store email addresses and mobile number of people they know in their internal Wadja address book and may also choose to send invitations and other communications to those addresses.
