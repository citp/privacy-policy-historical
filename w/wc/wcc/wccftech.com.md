**First-party cookie storage is minimized in analytics.js.**

The information stored in the local first-party cookie is reduced for analytics.js. Only an identifier made up of two randomly generated 32-bit numbers (e.g., 12345.67890) is used. Clearing or deleting cookies from a browser does not ensure that subsequent visits to a website will be considered new sessions in Analytics.

**Universal Analytics supports data collection without browser cookies.**

The Universal Analytics collection methods (analytics.js and the Measurement Protocol) can be implemented and used to collect user interaction data without cookies. Learn more about how to [opt-out from Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881)s.
