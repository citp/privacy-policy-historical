We are firmly committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.  We will only hold, process and transfer the data that we collect about you and which personally identifies you in accordance with applicable laws, this privacy policy and any terms set out at the point(s) at which data is collected (“Collection Terms”).  If there is any inconsistency between the Collection Terms and this privacy policy, the Collection Terms will prevail.

Except where stated or the context requires otherwise, references in this privacy policy to “you”, “your” or “yours” are to be taken as references to the site user and, where applicable, the user’s company and references to “us” or “we” are to be taken as references to WCN Plc.

We may collect various personal data about you, including:

  * Information you provide when you use the “book a demo”, “contact us” facility or fill in any enquiry or other forms on the site (for example, your name, email address and telephone number);
  * If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.



You must always provide accurate data and you agree to update it as necessary in the manner specified below.  You also agree that, in the absence of any update, we can assume that the data you have provided is correct.
