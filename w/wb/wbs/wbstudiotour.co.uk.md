INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

We share and disclose Information in the following ways or for any other purpose disclosed at the time of collection:

**Joint-controllers.** Two Warner Bros. entities jointly control your Information. See the end of this policy for further details.

**Law enforcement bodies and courts.**  We disclose Information in response to legal process, for example in response to a court order or a subpoena, or in response to a law enforcement body's request. We also disclose such Information to third parties: (i) in connection with fraud prevention activities, (ii) where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, (iii) in situations that can involve violations of our terms of use or other rules, (iv) to protect our rights and the rights and safety of others, and (v) as otherwise required by law.

**Change of control.**  We transfer Information in the event of a business transaction, such as if we or one of our business units or our relevant assets are acquired by, sold to, or merged with another company or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding or a business reorganisation.

**Service providers.**  Our agents and contractors have access to Information to help carry out the services they are performing for us, such as, but not limited to, fulfilment, creation, maintenance, hosting, and delivery of products and services, conduct marketing, handle payments, email and order fulfillment, administer contests, conduct research and analytics, or customer service.

**Affiliates and other third parties.**  We disclose Information to companies whose practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy. For example, we share Information we collect with our Warner Bros. affiliates to provide, improve, offer, market, and otherwise communicate with you about their own products and services.

**Linked sites.**  Some of our sites contain links to other sites, including Social Media Sites, whose information practices can be different from ours. You should consult the other sites' privacy disclosures and terms before submitting any Information, as we have no control over Information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

**Sponsors and co-promotions.**  We sometimes offer content or programs (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, promotions, games, applications or Social Media Site integrations) that are sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties collect or obtain Information from you when participating in the activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this Information. We encourage you to look at the privacy disclosure of any such third party to learn about their data practices.

**Advertising networks.**  We share certain Information with third parties to provide advertising to you based on your interests. For more information, please see our (i) Cookies and Other Technical Information and (ii) Ad Choices sections below.

YOUR CHOICES

**Marketing communications and sharing with third parties.**  We provide you with an opportunity to express your preferences with respect to receiving certain marketing communications from us, and our sharing of Information with trusted partners for their direct marketing purposes. If you ever decide in the future that you would like to update these preferences, you can (i) log in to an account you may have created with us to adjust your settings, or (ii) send us an email at [privacy@wb.com](mailto:privacy@wb.com). To opt out of receiving our email marketing communications, you can also follow the "unsubscribe" instructions provided in any marketing email you receive from us. If you previously chose to receive push notifications on your mobile device from us, but no longer wish to receive them, you can manage your preferences through your device or app settings, depending on the type of device.

**Ad Choices.**  We work with reputable third parties to present advertisements, and engage in data collection, reporting, ad delivery and response measurement, and site analytics on our sites and on third party websites across the Internet and applications over time. These third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixels, or similar technologies to perform this activity. They also obtain information about applications you use, websites you visit, and other information from across your devices and browsers in order to help serve advertising that will be more relevant to your interests on and off our sites and across your devices and browsers. This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising. They also use this information to associate various browsers and devices together for the purpose of interest-based advertising and other purposes like analytics.

For more information about interest-based advertising on your desktop or mobile browser, and your ability to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in self-regulatory programs, please visit [Your Online Choice](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) and/or the EDAA [Self-Regulatory Initiative for Online Behavioral Advertising](http://www.edaa.eu/). Please note that any opt-out choice you exercise through these programs will apply to interest-based advertising by the third parties you select, but will still allow the collection of data for other purposes, including research, analytics, and internal operations. You can continue to receive advertising, but that advertising will be less relevant to your interests.

You can have more options depending on your mobile device and operating system. For example, most device operating systems (e.g., iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provide their own instructions on how to limit or prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You can review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems to learn more about these features and how they apply to tailored in-app advertisements.

**Precise location information.** To disable the collection of precise location information from your mobile device through our mobile apps, you can access your mobile device settings and choose to limit that collection.

See also Cookies and Other Technical Information for more choices about managing other technical and usage information.

COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNICAL INFORMATION

**Cookies and other technologies.**  We, and our affiliates, third party service providers, and trusted partners send "cookies" to your device or use similar technologies to understand and enhance your online experience with us and through our advertising and media across the Internet including Social Media Sites, mobile apps, and video games.

Cookies are small text files placed in your browser. We also use pixels or "web beacons" that monitor your use of our sites. Web beacons are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a webpage for the purpose of transferring data, such as the IP address of the device that downloaded the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the type of browser that fetched the web beacon, and the identification number of any cookie on the device previously placed by that server. We also integrate “Software Development Kits” (“SDKs”), javascripts or portions of code into our applications/video games to perform similar functions as cookies and web beacons. For example, SDKs collect technical and usage information such as mobile device identifiers and your interactions with our app. Some of our sites use locally stored objects (“LSOs”) to provide certain content, such as video on demand, video clips, or animation, and a better user experience.

We can use cookies and other technologies to help recognise your browser or device, maintain your preferences, provide certain features, and collect Information about your online interactions with us, our content, and our communications. For example, when corresponding with you via HTML capable email, web beacons and other technologies let us know about your activity, including whether you received and opened our email, clicked through a link, or otherwise interacted with our content, and this information can be associated with Information previously collected.

We also use cookies and other technologies (i) to provide, develop, maintain, personalise, protect, and improve our sites, products, apps, services and video games, and to operate our business, (ii) to perform analytics, including to analyse and report on usage and performance of our content and marketing materials, (iii) to protect against, identify, and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity, (iv) to create aggregate data about groups or categories of our users, (v) to synchronise users across devices, affiliates, and trusted partners, and (vi) for us and our affiliates, and trusted partners to target, offer, market, or advertise products, apps, services or video games. Cookies and other technologies also facilitate, manage, and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through us.

DATA RETENTION

In broad terms, we will only retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. This means that the retention periods will vary according to the type of personal information and the reason that we have the personal information in the first place. For example, some personal information related to the provision of services to you or by you will be kept for a number of years in order to comply with various finance and tax related legal obligations. Other service related personal information may be kept for a different period because it is in our legitimate interests to do so in order to provide or receive appropriate follow up service.

We have a detailed internal retention policy that sets out varying retention periods for different categories of personal information depending on our legal obligations and whether there is a commercial need. After a retention period has elapsed, the personal information is securely deleted.

HOW YOU CAN ACCESS OR CORRECT INFORMATION

Under conditions, you have the right to ask us for a copy of your Information, to correct it, erase it or restrict its processing, and to obtain the Information you provide in a structured, machine readable format. You also have the right to ask us to transfer some of this Information to other organisations.

You have the right to object to the processing of personal information on the basis of our legitimate interests. Where we have asked for your consent to process Information, you have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.

If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to complain to an EU data protection authority where you live, work or where you believe a breach may have occurred.

We reserve the right not to allow access to your Information or to limit your rights (e.g. if such disclosure is prohibited by law or if the rights of another individual might be violated). In some instances, this may mean that we are able to retain your Information even if you withdraw your consent.

INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER

We operate internationally, and many of our systems are currently based in the United States, this means Information we collect will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations will not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union.

When we transfer your Information to our United States group members outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we make use of standard contractual clauses which have been approved by the European Commission. We also use these clauses when we transfer your Information to third parties outside the EEA or we may adopt other means to ensure that adequate safeguards are applied to your Information (e.g. Privacy Shield, BCR, etc). You may obtain a copy of the documents we use to protect your Information when it is transferred outside the EEA by contacting us via email at [privacy@wb.com](mailto:privacy@wb.com).

NOTIFICATION REGARDING UPDATES

From time to time, we can update this Privacy Policy. We will notify you about changes to this Privacy Policy by placing a notice on our sites. We encourage you to periodically check back and review this policy so that you always know our current privacy practices.
