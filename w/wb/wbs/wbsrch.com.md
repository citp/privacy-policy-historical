# Privacy Policy | WbSrch Web Search

WbSrch does not directly collect personally identifiable information from anyone, nor would we sell that information if we had it.

We do log searches to improve our search engine, but do not use tracking cookies and do not have any way to know who searched for what. We do not care who you are or what you're up to, but we do want to make searches better over time and be able to block spambots. We use general-purpose web analytics from [Alytik.com](http://alytik.com/) to gather aggregate visitor data, and that does not use any sort of tracking cookie.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements for goods and services. These companies may use cookies or web beacons for this purpose.
